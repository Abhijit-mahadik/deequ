The developers did what they set out to do, and they did it very competently - the game is smooth, design decisions make sense, the engine is well-optimized, and the new features compared to AC (like the nemesis system) really scream &#34;why hadn't anyone thought of this before?!&#34;.  Bonus points for being in the Lord of the Rings universe!  Really looking forward to the inevitable sequel, which they'd have to be crazy to not make.	2015-08-17

As it says in the title, its essentially Dead Island meets Mirrors Edge meets Assassins creed.  It's fun in that its a great co op game, and you do have the basic elements of dead island where you go on a mission, hunt something down, and then go back....rinse and repeat.  It also has the same elements of building weapons, hunting down supplies, killing zombies, storing stuff, weapons that die quickly, etc.  Where it gets fun is<br />1) at night when you have the super crazy zombies you have to hide from.  There is no way in killing them<br />2) the mirrors edge/assassins creed elements of free running and climbing tall buildings trying to get to safe zones<br /> The co op is really fun too, but it literally mirrors dead island<br /><br />The cool thing is that the story revolves around a character of middle eastern descent rather than your typical white guy here or black guy brute.	2015-08-17

First off he had a really hard time trying to put them on the joy sticks. They are made completely out of rubber so you have to stretch it on there. Now this task is difficult since your joysticks already have the rubber grip on them. Once he had them on, as he played Fifa the grips start to come off. Not worth the purchase.	2015-08-17

It’s also hilarious how angry you can get with your fellow gamer. It’s like playing Monopoly back in the day; families were torn apart for less. All jokes aside Mario Party 10 is fantastic. This game is also the great equalizer. Just when you think player 1 is taking the whole show with 80+ Stars… don’t worry… Bowser or something will level the playing field. Everyone has a chance to win.<br /><br />This game BEGS for some DLC. We are ready.

And yes, the PS4 is set as my primary PS4, so the content should be available to all users. Who ever came up with the idea to make half the armies DLC for the physical game should smacked upside the head.<br /><br />EDIT: Knocked it down from 2 stars to 1. My reason being that the DLC only works when the game is connected online to the Ubisoft store. If the game does not connect on start up (which happens the first time I start the game, every time) you get a message something like &#34;Store is offline, content unavailable. Or content may no longer available.&#34;<br /><br />What the heck kind of half baked garbage is that that the DLC (which should have just been on the disk to begin with) needs to authenticate with their server every time you play the game?	2015-08-17

Since this case was so cheap, I figured I didn't have anything to lose and ordered it. I was very surprised by the quality and it fit well even though my 3DS has a protective cover on it. The elastic gives it a sort of custom fit so you don't have to worry whether or not it's the new or old 3DS or if you have a cover on it...they all fit! It's great just to throw in your purse or backpack and be on your way.	2015-08-17

That will definitely change. The graphics are very impressive and the environments have great detail. The effects from various environment changes/angles is also very impressive. The game play is entertaining and really allows you to play however you like, so if you have plenty of time you can chug through the story/main missions or if you don't have a lot of time, you can cruise through smaller missions like hostage rescues, hunting and racing (racing is a little odd I'll admit).<br /><br />I was entertained by the story and the missions. Some missions I definitely didn't care for but it didn't ruin the game. And if you have never played the series before, its not a bad time to start.	2015-08-17

Originally wanted the set that included Witcher 3, but that sold out too damn fast. Never the less, the system is really cool and an interesting upgrade when comparing it to its predecessor the PS3. I like the PS4's home page and loadout for each specific area. The way it works at times has me think often on how a Nintendo 3DS works at times with its interface and apps. Now as for Batman Arkham Knights, I look forward to finishing off the series but hear good and bad things about the overall plot to the game. Luckily enough if I do not like Arkham Knights I still got that FF Type-0 to try out and a year of PSN Plus to download free games until the holiday season when better titles release.	2015-08-17

Don't let the older negative reviews fool you, after I updated the firmare, which took less than ten minutes total, the chat function works just fine. My friends all say I sound the same as normal. I never tried the product before updating so I can't say how bad the issue was. Anyhow, these work great!<br /><br />With all of the features and the high quality sound, I do recommend these headphones. They're great for gaming on my Xbox One, they pair up easily with my phone for music and videos and they are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />My only gripe is that I keep accidentally touching the buttons on the outside of the headphones when I take them off or adjust them on my head. Several times I've changed a setting unintentionally. It'll br fine once I remember not to touch those areas. No big deal though anyway because I just change the setting back using the companion app on my phone. The app works perfectly for choosing your settings. I only use the app to choose settings in fact, it's just easier.<br /><br />It's a great product and I couldn't be happier! Really, don't worry about the mic issues, it works just fine after the update and I actually prefer this style since there's no mic to worry about.	2015-08-17

It never reaches the excellence of that game. It isn't a one star game though. I have spent many hours playing this game now and still do from time to time. Once you figure out how to play the game, how to manage the intricacies of the interface, it can actually be quite fun. Most of the points against the game concerning micro-management are not a big deal. By the middle of the game you could potentially have hundreds of planets but really only a dozen or so that you really care about. If some systems spam produce troop ships or infantry, so what, as far as I know, there is no limit on how many ships or troops you can have available. The star systems and planets are fantastic to look at and the variations really make the initial exploration of the galaxy a blast. If you get sick of colonizing, you can tell the AI to auto-colonize as colony ships become available. Your race characteristics determine what planets are habitable I believe, but most of the new races suck. My biggest beef with the game is the elimination of several of the really cool races from MOOII, but you can find them as magnate civilization specials on some planets. Troops built on these planets will appear with different pictures, which is a small but very cool addition. Diplomacy is pretty stupid, and pointless, since your allies will colonize any planets you haven't taken in your star systems. Very frustrating. Once your planets gain max population, they will begin auto-colonizing other less desirable planets in-system or even in other near by systems. There's a lot of small things like this that show this game is much better than most people make it. The race building and galaxy creation are good, though many of the race selections aren't things that obviously show up in the game, mostly background macros that you will never see.<br /><br />Technology is pretty simple but it works, though again what certain techs do is not obvious in the game but morebackground. You can have up to two DEAs in each sector of your planet. You get to choose which go in each sector but what alluvial, hard scrabble, fertile, etc and the terrain of it actually does to the output is unknown. Other than your first few planets, you aren't going to care about this and will let the AI take over based on the colonies needs. Again, you will only care about a few planets or systems by the middle of the game. You will be busy extinguishing all the other races. People complain about the interface, but most of the interface comes down to a few buttons to give the AI orders. Some things like forced labor don't do anything to change the game that I am aware of, Other things like the oppressometer are essential to weed out enemy spies, though at the cost of some rebellions.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The game is beautiful and functional. I haven't had any problems with bugs or crashing. Any game that is playable deserves some credit.<br />The game is complicated. A lot of the griping about the game is probably coming from people who didn't figure out how to control the AI.<br />The game is fun and has a high replay ability in my experience. Stick with it and you'll figure it out.<br />The races feel more balanced than from MOOII when you were always fighting Saakra and Klakon.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />All the races that I hated from MOOII survived and none of the ones I loved made it.<br />The espionage is terrible. You will pull your hair out as techs are constantly stolen from you. The leaders are cool and diverse but seem to always get killed by enemy spies before they really help you out.  I think spies in your que can be on defense so maybe that helps but it's very clunky.<br />At a certain point in the game you are unstoppable but that still doesn't help you find Antaran X's. I have never managed to find more than one of them. This may just be because I'm not building ships with the right equipment. if that's the case, the game doesn't explainthat, in fact it doesn't explain much at tall.<br />I absolutely hate when other races colonize planets in systems you control. I know this comes down to colonizing algorithms in the game's AI but it's stupid and frustrating. You can stop the colonizing by having a fleet in the system at least.<br /><br />This game is not as bad as some make it out to be. If you quit too soon you will never get it. If you give it a chance it will surprise you. It's not a one star or a five star game, but it is fun to play if you take the time to figure it out.	2015-08-17

However, it is also a very dark game - dark as in it's very hard to see what is going on on the screen at times because I can barely see it. I would think I just need to adjust the brightness, but other parts of the game are just perfect and I have no issues. This game has a LOT of cut scenes. I really don't mind cut scenes, especially when the graphics are so nice, however it makes it feel like the actual game play time is quite short.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this game does not have a finished polish to it. There are a few additional issues that I wouldn't expect in a $60 video game. First, there were some very obvious issues with the timing of the voices and movement of the characters mouths - think bad Kung Fu movie dubbed in English. I also had an issue with the game loading at the end of Chapter 1. The loading screen froze and I had to go and replay the previous scene several times to force the next scene to load properly.<br /><br />This game is NOT one of those open ended games - Assassins Creed, Dying Light, etc. You can't just go around and explore. Yes, there are several hidden items you can find, but the game is VERY linear. There is no map system because you can only go one path, you just keep going until you get where it wants you to go. You can't interact with NPC's. Walking past NPC's in the street. they will ignore you as if you aren't even there.<br /><br />I have to say overall I'm glad I only paid $20 for this game during Amazon's &#34;Black Friday&#34; sale. The graphics are really nice, but the game/story line really haven't kept my interest. I've had the game for about a month and have only played 2 times.	2015-08-17

The gameplay is superbly solid( you have to be smart about how you attack enemies running in and shooting won't work), the environment have background that you just want to stare at because of how warped and dreamlike they appear. The best the game has to offer is the amazing visuals, the way your pc isn't too overpowered you have careful you have to move around, and the story unfolds really well like a good mystery.<br /><br />The only things that could have been better was if the pace was better it just seem to run a few hours too much(20sh hrs or so), and give the main character a little more backstory or maybe more dialogue.	2015-08-17

Like so many people I have way too many things with wires and I'm tired of them. Here is my assessment:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Feel sturdy and well built. I'm not too worried about them breaking under normal use.<br />- Sound quality is excellent.<br />- Switching between audio modes is extremely easy. It's a button.<br />- The padding on the band makes them a bit more comfortable than other headsets.<br />- They definitely look cool<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Like other reviewers have indicated, the microphone could be better. I don't use the microphone much but if you do, you might find yourself a bit frustrated.<br />- Despite the padding, after awhile, my hears got a little sore. That's happened with every headset I've ever used and it could just be me.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good headset but for those out there who rely heavily on the microphone, it could be a deal breaker.	2015-08-17

I have had this remote, and have been using it regularly, for the past four years.<br /><br />As I see it, there are two important conclusions I have made.<br /><br />The first is that in terms of its functionality as a DVD/Blu-Ray/media playback remote for PS3, it works wonderfully. Period. It's a great remote in that respect.<br /><br />The second is that whoever was responsible for the design of its size and shape and button layout should be fired, because there are two MAJOR problems with it that make it SUPER ANNOYING, whenever you use it: 1. the size and shape is bizarre; it is thin and the bottom is curved, so holding it (if you have large hands, as I do) is awkward, and if the remote is resting on a flat surface and you attempt to push a button on it without picking it up first, it teeters to one side or the other because of the curve, and therefore will not take the input. 2. The MOST irritating thing about this remote is the fact that wherever it is, whenever you pick it up - and especially when you are only moving it or something, and not intending to turn on or use your PS3 - because of the centrally located PS button, and its sensitivity, you will INVARIABLY accidentally push it, thus turning on the PS3 accidentally, when you didn't intend to, resulting in having to go through the hassle of turning on your TV, changing the input to PS3, and going through the 2 or 3 button pushes required to turn the thing off again, because of course it's not like a basic Blu-Ray player with a simple 'power' on/off button....After countless times over the years having to go through that waste of time turning off the PS3 after accidentally turning it on, I finally got fed up and threw this remote away, and went back to using the Dualshock controller, instead. I just hope whoever designs a PS4 remote reads this review, first...	2015-08-17

I prefer a good story, meaningful characters, and graphics that are cleanly presented. This game follows the same mold as most military shooters in the Call of Duty tradition and tries to stun their audience with a fast pace and ridiculous plot as a means to cover their lack of creativity or polish. I have not played the multiplayer side of this game although I am assuming most people will buy Battlefield for that very purpose. If you are looking for a Killzone, Fallout 3, Bioshock Infinite, Half LIfe FPS look elsewhere. In fact just buy any of those games instead. Even the Bad Company series of previous Battlefield games were far more fun and interesting with characters that were at least amusing and more coherent to the storyline.  TL:DR It's a crappy single player laid gently onto an awesome online FPS.	2015-08-17

Very cheap plastic quality and construction.  Previously own the PX5 for 4 years  without a single problem.  These are an obvious downgrade from the PX5 in terms of design and quality materials.

The stick action isn't the best in the world from what I've used but it definitely gets the job done and adjusts quite well from firm to loose.

But I was also nervous because he's picky, as in if the game doesn't gain his interest within the first 10mins of playing he won't play it anymore. Especially if it's a magic, fairytale kind of games he will not play those kind. But he has been playing this game non stop to the point where he hasn't even tried the other game I bought him.

It connects directly into a Wii Remote, and is supposed to act as a substitute for people that want a Gamecube controller but can't get their hands on an adapter.  The end of the cord that connects into the controller is really stiff, and I was afraid it might tear.  The control stick on the left side is made with a light plastic and isn't firm; in fact it can spin around while you play.  I played 4 rounds of casual smash, and the control stick on the left side popped out of place and I don't know how to pop it back in.  I wasn't being rough with it at all.  I'll be returning this first thing tomorrow.	2015-08-17

It takes you on the biggest & deepest journey through Elder Scrolls lore that I've ever seen. The skills and specializations are well-thought-out, the world design is beautiful and true to the racial architecture's history, the quests pleasantly carry you from zone to zone without any game-breaking hiccups, and even the fetch quests aren't all that bad (at least they have purpose, not &#34;I'm hungry, I want 7 netch eggs for soup!&#34;).  The console version, while suffering from lower graphics quality than the PC counterpart, are still very good, and the UI seems a better fit for console-based gameplay. All in all, I put about 80 hours in the first 3 weeks in PvE alone, and plan to put many more.	2015-08-17

The PS4 controller is nice, but it has a useless touchpad and a still-nonsensical placement of the analog sticks so that you have to strain your thumbs to use them.  The big thing the PS4 controller did right over the first xbox one controller was the very-convenient headphone jack built in.  Now this new xbox one controller has included its own headphone jack, which is hugely convenient for anybody with kids and a wife who don't appreciate all the noise.  I still think the sound output is slightly better on the PS4 jack, but its still a big improvement over the previous unworkable dongles.	2015-08-17

A fantastic gaming system that includes a great game! I own both the PS4 and Xbox One so here is my perspective on these gaming systems:<br /><br />PS4 Pros: Great controller with surprising features like the trackpad, better thumbsticks than the Xbox, graphically superior (50% more GPU compute cores, 6 more asynchronous compute units, twice as many ROPs), integrated power supply (no power brick)<br />PS4 Cons: USB only on front of console, consumes more power than XB1 when on/gaming (less when in standby mode)<br /><br />Arkham Knight: This is my first time playing the Arkham series of Batman games and I am thoroughly impressed: Good story/pacing, excellent graphics and details, superb voice acting, fun side quests/games<br /><br />I think there is still a place for my XB1, although I will only be using it for exclusives like Halo or Quantum Break. While the XB1 will benefit from DirectX12 and other software optimizations, it will still not be able to match the computing muscle of the PS4. Both are great consoles, but once you own both the distinction becomes clear. I prefer to use an Apple TV for Netflix/Hulu streaming as it is much more power efficient than these next-gen consoles for something like passive movie/TV watching. If you're a Halo fan, get the PS4 and play all the other games on this system. Pick up a cheaper/slimmer? Xbox next year when Master Chief gets back in the action.	2015-08-17

Cliffhanger ending sets up what could be an excellent series of games, if the developer spent more time on actual gameplay and less on qte events. Shooter mechanics are similar to gears or war, however not quite as tight. The story was top notch and the character and story development were flawless. Because of its short length I can't recommend it for purchase over 20-25 dollars, bit it's definitely worthy or a rental/play through.	2015-08-17

Maybe you could send me one so she could do the same to another teacher. Classy. That was my review of the seller, let's see if they follow through, here's her review......... This product is very easy to use and looks great.  I like the convenience and ease to install, glides very nicely and looks great.I would recommend it to a friend.	2015-08-17

I think it just feels lighter but if you need something a bit more substantial in weight user an original SNES controller with a USB adapter.  2) The buttons are a bit stiff out of the box and needed a bit of breaking in but nothing rocking some Super Off Road or Super Mario Kart won't fix.  Some other notes:  I've used this controller(2 of them) with a retropi iteration of the Raspbery Pi system and it works great although needs to be set up and there are some configs that need to be changed to user a player 1, player 2 format.  Check the forums.  This gamepad works great on a PC as well.  I was able to plug in to a Windows 8.1 laptop and play with many emulators right away, no trouble.  This brand is solid, good price, I recommend.	2015-08-17

I think adjusting the controls to match his size (4 years old, 40 inches tall) is a little annoying. I usually just skip making an avatar because you have to get your child lined up in a certain pose and they have to hold it long enough for the system to capture it. This can take about 30 seconds and my son isn't good at holding a stretched out pose that long. I had to do this every time he wanted to play so I just started skipping it all together. He didn't care as long as he got to play. I enjoy playing two person with him and working together on missions.	2015-08-17

Annoys me that none of the other reviews said this explicitly since it is my main use case, but glad I took the chance on it. Perhaps they are old reviews and Windows has since written drivers - either way, the review mentioning XPadder is clearly an advertisement for $10 software!  Seems very sturdy, has a smooth finish, and is well constructed overall. Only minor differences between it and a real Dual Shock. Probably wouldn't notice it was third party unless pointed out. Cannot yet testify to the reliability (just got it in the mail), but for $10 I won't lose any sleep if it breaks.  Works with AutoHotkey, but not as I'm used to - here is a good starting point if you are interested: http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/370-key-mapping-for-nyko-airflo-pc-and-dual-analog-gamepads/.  5 Stars, for now.	2015-08-17

If you're looking for a really good kart racing game that's as good as or even better than the Mario Kart series, then I'm here to tell you that I would recommend Modnation Racers on PS3 more than any other game including this one.  LBP Karting can be downright frustrating sometimes with no way to defend yourself against other racers no matter how well you're doing and the drifting mechanic is only average at best.  It's not a bad game but after playing Modnation Racers I felt like this game was 2 steps backwards as far as depth and just pure enjoyability.  If you can find Modnation Racers for about the same price, I would suggest that game over the others.  It has up to 4 player split screen and 2 player split screen online and the amount of free content to download at this point is staggering.<br />  I about half price for this game and I feel as though it wasn't really worth it since I already have Modnation Racers.	2015-08-17

It paired quickly to both, but it only moves up/down/left/right, but none of the other buttons worked except select which makes it impossible to navigate screens without a back button. None of the 4 game buttons register in menus or games. Another controller I bought uses X for select and B button for back so I know it should have worked in a similar way (Kootek® 2.4G Wireless Game Controller Gamepad Joystick for Android TV Box Smartphones Tablets PC Windows 8/7/XP). I wanted a bluetooth controller so it would not take up a usb port like the kootek. However, it has a nice feel to it, more solid and grippy than Kootek which is more slick. If this had worked I would have kept it because it is worth the money and feels better than the kootek for my taste.	2015-08-17

I think this is a good game, though I don't think it's worthy of a lengthy review. I got it back when the SNES was still current. There really isn't a whole lot to it. It's just a pretty straightforward, pretty much run-of-the-mill, mostly side-scrolling hack-and-slash action game. Nothing groundbreaking or really mind-blowing here, at least not from what I've seen of it (which I believe is most of it). My brother and I used to play it together (it's 2P simultaneous). (In fact, I believe this is the game we were playing, or trying to play, when my first SNES croaked!) It has just a few stages, though I don't think my bro or I ever got to the very end. We still enjoyed playing it, though. (As with many other games, you can probably figure out  the controls [and other things] just by playing, but one sort-of neat, if not particularly useful thing that would probably not easily become apparent is that you can change the color of your character by pushing Select while the game is paused. There are eight colors.)  A game like this on a modern-day system would be WAY too simplistic (at least if it was being sold for full price instead of cheap); even for a SNES game, it could have had more to it. Still, if you like old 16-Bit-era action games, it isn't bad. (Though the prices for it [at the moment, anyway] are insane! Do NOT pay them for this game unless you're a REALLY serious collector or someone else who MUST have it, and for whom price is not an issue! If you're not, then see if you can find the game elsewhere for a more reasonable price!)	2015-08-17

I played Fifa 11, 12 & 13 and playing this game I realised that I would be learning a different system. It is not a bad game, but feels lacking compared to Fifa. Less teams and options are basic in comparison. I have health problems that make playing some games very difficult. The controls for this game were similar to Fifa, but lack in ability for me to use. I have to play on easier settings for games and this game just did not work. I did not like the camera choices. Again, it is not a bad game and I would give later versions a chance if I could personalise the settings better.	2015-08-17

The nvidia shield tv is finally here, and while this is a new type of Android device for the Nvidia team, they have really knocked it out of the park with this one. The nvidia shield tv is the third device in the shield line up, starting with the recently renamed shield portable, the shield tablet, and now the shield tv. The shield tv runs a customised version of android, called android tv. Android tv is a skinned version of android that provides access to all your games, media content, and apps on an easy to use interface that can be controlled with either a remote, or a game pad. Once you open up the box, and get everything plugged in and boot up the device, you will be asked to pair up the included shield controller. This controller is wonderful, light weight, with very responsive controls and analog sticks, and of course it is wireless via wifi-direct to allow super low latency. The controller chargers from an included usb cable, much like most smartphones today use. The battery life is decent at best, you can get about a day and a half with heavy useage. The shield tv has multiple ways to get games and apps, the first is through the play store. The play store is included on the device and has a nicely redone design just for android tv, which sorts out apps and games into multiple categories. The down side is that while there are a ton of games, there is no where near as many games or apps as the playstore on phones has, this is because the android tv play store only allows games or apps on the store that support controllers and remotes. The second option, is sideloading. I won't go into too much detail on this, but if there is an app or game that supports controllers and isn't on the android tv play store, then you can sideload it to play on the shield tv. The third option, is trying out grid streaming. This wonderful free feature for the time being, allows you to stream full-featured games such as saints row to your decice. This is free for anyone who has a shield tv device and it feels very responsive! This is of course done over the internet, and thus requires a very fast internet connection. If you have an Nvidia gpu on your home computer, this also will let you stream any of your pc games to the device, which works great and is a lot of fun. The last option for games is the download section. The download section lists off games made specifically for the nvidia shield tv, that take advantage of the amazing gpu of the device. There is everything from rpgs, to full-fledged shooters like borderlands to download (not yet released). The shield tv is the most powerful android tv device, and heck, even the most power android device ever created. It has an Nvidia Tegra X1 gpu, which allows the device to support full pc grade graphics, and can support gaming at up to 4k, 60fps. Wow, talk about future proofing this device! Now lets talk about the pros and cons.<br /><br />*Pros of the device:<br />Great controller<br />Most powerful android device<br />Free game streaming<br />Lots of new games are always added<br />4K gaming and media at 60fps<br /><br />*Cons of the device:<br />Battery life in the controller could be better<br />Lacks a few media apps such as amazon instant<br />Doesn't have full playstore access to all apps<br /><br />One last thing to note, you can either purchase the 16gb model, or for $100 more you could buy the 500gb model, and while that is a lot more space, the device does have access to two full usb 3.0 ports, a micro sd port and a micro usb port! The micro sd card port can be used for storage, and you can also plug in external hard drives for even more storage, i currently have two 3tb hard drives plugged in and a 64gb sd card inside that work wonderfully. If you're interested in this device, and have a spare hard drive or sd card lying around, it might be worth saving your self the extra $100. Thank you for taking time to read this review, i hope it helps you out in your decision to buy an nvidia shield tv.hield tv.	2015-08-17

Awesome game for the anime fan.<br />It has a bunch (I believe 52 of them) of characters from shonen mangas. BUT only 39 are playable the rest are aids that you can select to help you like in other fighters but not controlable. If you don't see your favorite anime character show is because it's not from an anime that appear on the shonnen comics.<br /><br />If you were into anime from the 80s or a fan of newer animes of today then you won't find a better game to test their power.<br />You have characters like goku and vegeta, ichigo, Lufin, naruto/sasuke/madara to others that were bigger outside the U.S. globally like ruroni kenshin, Seiya from saint seiya/caballeros del zodiaco or more old school like kenshiro.<br /><br />The PLUS version is fully in Japanese audio BUT all voices have English only subtitles. No dubs no other languages. The menus and everything else is in English so this is the version to get.<br /><br />There is a story mode which is a nice way to start understanding gameplay mechanics, but is not deep at all. It does add some nice replay value since there are 4 of them. Same story different characters. You have to boost characters and items in this mode, but nothing hard and should be Easy to boost everything.<br />All boosts aside this won't affect much of online or arcade gameplay. Only cards can affect them and are not required and most won't have them turn on to play multiplayer anyway.<br />Balanced game this is not. Some characters are better some are meh, but you can master any of them and beat the cpu but online you will need to select better ones if you want to win.<br /><br />Mix ad match is great. Having my fav characters battle each other is amazing and works great. Especials are awesome, but more famous characters like naruto have better looking specials effect wise.<br />This game is not for competition fighting, I'm sure in competitions we would only see the sane 6 characters playing.<br />To unlock characters you need to spend points you get from the story mode or battleing online and then going to the character store to spend the points. No real money, should be fairly easy to unlock them all after 1 story gameplay. After 2-3 hrs on the story you can spend what you got to unlock a bunch of your favorite ones. You need to pass the story levels to unlock more spaces. So if you want to unlock everyone then you need to do the story mode to have all the spaces be available. Takes a few hours only though and will learn how to control all characters more or less.<br />Most characters use the same control scheme some are close combat others are long range, but button presses are the same.<br />Ultimates are fairly easy to pull and techniques are easy to do as well.<br />I highly recommend this game (PLUS) version to any anime fan. The graphics are great, the characters look great and it's a lot of fun.<br />Online doesn't seem to have many people playing and this was the first weeks of release so don't expect to constantly play just online.<br />You can coop w someone at your house or online either in story mode or multiplayer so that is cool as well.<br /><br />You can add easily your own music from your hd in the PS3 version and I did it for the music I wanted to hear from my fav characters and it kinda works because they can get mixed together and you have two singers and sings that don't match when doing ultimate a singing at the same time. A simple patch to stop level music from playing when doing ultimate would Make the uploaded songs work perfect.<br />Any questions lmk!	2015-08-17

Only thing getting used to are the weird controls of the Batmobile. Other than that just start playing you won`t regret it.	2015-08-17

Overall the product works as intended but coming from a computer technician perspective this could use some improvements.<br /><br />Pros: -LED display with room and current Xbox temperature.<br />  - Relatively quiet operating fan.<br /><br />Cons: -Does not attach to the Xbox but rather sits on top of it.<br />-LED display should on the front of the system not on top, I don't want to get up just to look at the temperature (I should be able to just look  at it from a sitting position.<br />-This product could be better if it had 2 fans sucking the hot hair as the one fan does not cover the whole area from the Xbox exhaust vent thus not as cooling efficient as it can be.<br />-The exhaust should be just as big as the fan otherwise its creating a bottleneck or push the hot air upwards just like the Xbox design.	2015-08-17

First of all, when I started it up with some of my SNES games they didn't work. I tried 4 different games in a row and none of them actually booted up; It was about the 6th time when one of them miraculously started up. It seems to start up at random, maybe 20% of the time. There is also a bright blue light that can be distracting to the player if played in a darkly lit room. There is also no cart eject button, which makes it EXTREMELY (it's so difficult I have to write in caps) hard to pull out the cartridges by force. I had to pick up the console itself just to pull out F-ZERO. The pros are very minimal, but these are them: The console itself is extremely light, which can be a good thing and can be a bad thing. But for the sake of this review I'm going to say it's a pro. It comes with two controllers, which are identical to your classic SNES controller. If you are looking to reenact the fun times you had with the real SNES in the 90s, this is a worse version of it. Overall, I wouldn't suggest buying this product, as you can find a real SNES console on eBay for a similar price with much better quality.	2015-08-17

Sorry, folks, I'm not a gamer -- but I am a professional editor. I spend about 12 hours a day looking at a computer screen. I noticed that after dinner that my eyes just felt tired, night after night, so I thought I'd give these glasses a try.<br /><br />I have 20/20 vision so I was pretty nervous that I was developing problems with my eyesight, but after using these for 3 full weeks (which is nearly 200 articles edited) I noticed a change in how my eyes felt at night. To sum it up, they weren't tired.<br /><br />It took me a couple days to get used to the Gunnar Optiks glasses -- they brighten the screen in a way that makes my eyes not have to work as hard. It took me a while for my eyes to realize that they could relax... I found myself squinting for no reason and then loosening/relaxing my eyes. After a few days of telling my eyes to chill out, it became natural and I stopped squinting in the first place.<br /><br />These are outstanding for anyone who has, or is worried about, eye fatigue. I'm buying a pair for my company's Creative Director, who tried these out and loved them (though she wants a different style!).<br /><br />Great product and well worth the money. If you're using a computer screen or TV for hours a day, you're spending pennies a day to feel comfortable (and probably staving off future eye problems!).	2015-08-17

I had been looking for a decent golf game for years because I just didn't find the EA Tiger series to be fulfilling.  The higher levels for better gear, etc. just wasn't my thing.  I wanted realistic style golf plus I liked to be able to design my own courses, which you couldn't do with EA.<br /><br />I really took a flier and picked up this game and was blown away.  It's not a splashy graphics EA style arcade golf, it's really a simulation.  You have to take into account the club, the wind, the firmness of the green, etc.  You can't just &#34;grip and rip&#34; like Tiger (and now Rory McIlroy.)  This game is really a good simulator for someone who is a true golf enthusiast.<br /><br />And the course designer is fantastic.  There's a lot more that could be added to it, and I hope they do, but as is it rockets this game FAR ahead of the EA franchise.  The communities that build around the game because of course designers and tournaments enhances the game well beyond the actual software itself.<br /><br />If you love golf, you'll love this.  If you just want to play arcade golf where you shoot -40 every single time and every single shot goes perfectly down the middle every single time, then you probably want EA.	2015-08-17

I love the game. at least when I played it on PC. so when I got the Evil Edition for the PS4 to play with my PSN friends I encountered many problems connecting to multiplayer servers (stuck in loading screens, players unable to join in game party, etc.) I did some research and found that a small percentage of players could not play online -- Those being players with Belkin routers. Unfortunately, there is no &#34;fix&#34; for this that Blizzard could find and so if you buy this game you will need a different router or simply to connect direct to the modem. This, in my opinion, is a game breaking issue and thus it's 2 star review.<br />***overall this is a fun game, especially when playing with friends or online, but if you buy then it make sure you don't have a Belkin router	2015-08-17

XBOX ONE COMPATIBILITY EXPLAINED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW Excellent quality headphones! I use them if I'm chatting online, and when I am playing locally, because the sound is unreal. They give you a huge advantage when playing Call of Duty online because you can hear every little sound around you. There's been many times where I could hear an opponent's footsteps coming up behind me, so I turned and blasted them before they could hit me. You'll always know when an opponent is moving nearby.  I use these with my Xbox 360. If your using your component or composite cables, you do not need an adapter or anything else. Everything you need is included. If your outputting in HDMI, then you will also need your component or composite audio cables (red & white) for these to work.  For some reason, some component/composite cables block the HDMI slot on your 360, preventing you from using both, so if you want to output your video with HDMI, then make sure your component/composite cables does not block the HDMI output slot on your unit.  I would definitely recommend this headset, especially if your a fan of Call of Duty Ghosts, because the designs and colors on these are very cool!  XBOX ONE COMPATIBILITY UPDATE: I just recently got an Xbox One, and wasn't sure if this headset would work with it because it's not really advertised as being able to do so, but I'm happy to say this headset works great with the Xbox One!  Basically your Xbox One controller acts like an amplifier, so you actually will not use the included amplifier, the RCA audio cables, the USB plug, nor any of the other cables included with this headset, which is awesome! All you need is the headphones themselves, and the single cable that's attached to them. You'll plug that one cable into the bottom of your Official Microsoft Brand Xbox One Controller (generic controllers will not work). Now on your Xbox One dashboard, click the menu button (which was the &#34;Start&#34; button on the 360) click &#34;Settings&#34;, to the right and down a bit, click &#34;Devices & Accessories&#34;. Select the proper controller. Now click &#34;Volume&#34;. You'll see &#34;Headset volume&#34;, and &#34;Mic monitoring&#34;. Turn these options all the way up, and that's it!  The way I understand it, if you have one of the older Xbox One controllers, that doesn't have an audio jack, then you will need to purchase this adapter &#62;&#62;&#62; [[ASIN:B00IAVDOS6 Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter]]  I have a newer model though, so I didn't need the adapter.  Also VERY IMPORTANT ... If your getting this for the Xbox One, DO NOT get the wireless edition. You'll spend the extra money for nothing! I purchased the cheapest version of this headset, The Shadow edition. I say that because the Xbox One controller is already wireless, and delivers the game's audio to your ears while transmitting your mic signals, therefore the wired headset becomes wireless when using it with an Xbox One!  I had all these questions before I purchased an Xbox One, and no one really knew the answers, so I wanted to post those answers here.  I hope this is helpful! Thank you	2015-08-17

So I may be comparing this stick to those others.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the components goes, this item is great. It functions equally well with the PS4 and PS3 and even PC. The controls used are pretty much the standard now a days with fighting arcade sticks. The TE 2 features standard Sanwa OBS buttons and a JLF Joystick. For those that don't know, Sanwa along with another company Seimitsu is pretty much ranked among the top Japanese arcade parts manufactures. The TE 2 is accurate as expected, works well and takes a beating. It also includes a detachable cable that can be stored within the stick and I'm sure can be easily replaced through Madcatz if need be. The buttons can also be easily replaced and are fairly inexpensive and found online easily. One of the great things is that Madcatz encourages users to modify the TE 2 to their personal liking. Which means any modifications that include simple button swaps and art swaps  are covered under warranty. Though this is a great accomplishment, it also paves the way for some of my biggest problems with the stick.<br /><br />At currently 200 USD  you are basically paying a premium for a niche item. Such a premium price is expected to have premium parts right? Well not exactly. Madcatz unfortunately seems to be stingy with a lot of the aesthetic parts of the stick. First of all, the stick is highly marketed as a mod able stick and personalize to your liking. Typically what needs to be done is you have to order a custom made blank plexi and the print out artwork to match etc. Well the Madcatz stick includes a so called plexi to make things easier. Unfortunately the plexi is in reality an extremely thin sheet of transparency. Literally it feels like one of those things you put on an overhead projector. It scratches terribly easy, and it warps under the stress of simply resting your palms on the stick. For some reason it also creates a strange rainbow effect when pressed against the underlying artwork. The material seems to attract buildup from your sweat like a magnet so it is hard to keep neat and intact.  It is to my understanding that the original versions of the TE 2 actually included a plexi which makes it even harder to understand why they would supply such a cheap piece of material.<br /> The Tool that is included with the stick isn't the best either. I suppose it would be handy in a situation where you wouldn't have something more practical with you, but the screws that come stock with the TE2 are fairly tight and hard to unscrew, at least for the first time with just the tool alone. One of the screws which holds the side panels in place is also misaligned in some manner so it doesn't sit flush with the rest of the bezel. Some of the side and top bezels also don't seem to lie flush against the outer case so it feels strange when you put your hand on certain parts. I suppose it isn't a huge game breaking issue, but when added up it makes me feel slightly cheated for the money that needs to be put on the table for one of these things.<br /><br />Many of the issues that bothered me are quite minor, but I specifically bought this stick in order to personalize it and thought it would be simple to do so. Unfortunately I was unsatisfied with the plexi and I will have to spend some extra money to bring it up to my standards. For anyone else that's interested check out Art's Hobbies. He provides some nice replacement plexis.<br />That being said, I feel like I may have overpaid a bit given the quality of some of the materials. The design is great, but I don't understand why Madcatz would provide such mediocre panels. Even so, I am fairly happy with pretty much the rest of theTE 2. I'd recommend it as a great stick but for those looking to customize be prepared to put a little more effort.	2015-08-17

It is the only PC game I ever come back to because it is complex, time extensive, and never ending. Even when you hit space stage you will never run out of planets to explore. I was shocked upon reading the reviews that so many others rated the game so low. Yes, creature do not mingle from their nests in creature stage, but different species of creature rarely mingle. No, the coolest mouth may not be as effective as the dull mouth but you can't have everything you want in real life. You have to make sacrifices and Spore is a representative of real life interactions. Civilization and tribal stage both have more complex relationships than creature stage because that is the way the real world works. The amount of creativity this game allows is, in my opinion, outstanding. Some players also complained of not all parts being available, but I myself have collected them all in the past. It just takes patience and a lot of work. Plus, before you evolve into tribal stage you get another opportunity to evolve your creature, and as tribal stage no longer looks at the power of creature parts, you can customize as much as you want as long as you have enough evolution points for it. I think the game is great, the graphics are amazing, and I never get tired of it. That being said, I would highly recommend purchasing this game.	2015-08-17

The entire reason why I bought this was to gut it and mod it.  To that degree it worked great.  I had to remove a little glue from the pcb, but otherwise it was a painless modding experience.<br /><br />Now as for the joystick itself.  It's not bad for around $40.  I played around with it a little before I took it apart, and it performed decently with some of the games I tried it with.  It's not perfect, but I wouldn't expect it to be.  But I wasn't missing tons of inputs or anything.<br /><br />One issue with the stock joystick is that the buttons activate directly onto a circuit board.  Which seems like a pretty big design flaw.  Eventually the board will break being used under that kind of stress.  So as a stock joystick this thing is probably not built to last.  Bur this is likely a symptom of the price point.<br /><br />Taken for what it is, this joystick is almost tailor made for modding.  So that's what I've based my review on.  If you just want a cheap joystick for all of your fighters and whatnot, then you might want to take a star off of the review score at your discretion.  It's a cheap enough stick, but one that's liable to break on you after enough use.	2015-08-17

And while throwing more stuff at the player isn’t the perfect recipe for success, I was happy to play a richer, larger version of one of my favorite games in recent years. Its full of overwhelming amount of stuff to do this is insane value for money.<br />  Unfortunately, the story might be pale and the characters are bland and boring, but it is easy to forgive since it is so damn fun to free Kyrat. It does not matter if you prefer to sneak around and hide in bushes and trees, or just charge into an enemy camp on an elephants back. Far Cry 4 will not be a classic that people will talk about years to come, but it will entertain you greatly while it lasts.<br />OVERALL: Great game that will last your for hours. Pick up a buddy and play co-op !!!	2015-08-17

Not everyone needs a completely open world to have fun. My only real nitpick with this game was the ending, which I feel was an after thought. It could of been so much better. I get they wanted to leave the story open to a sequel, but it could of been so much more. I hope they're given another chance, but it feels like with all the negative press, this may be dead in the water for a sequel.<br /><br />I snagged this on prime day and all the collector's items are great and I definitely feel like I got a steal. The voice acting is pretty good and the characters interesting, but they could of been a bit more developed. While this game won't be for everyone, if you'd like to see the platform at it's apex graphically, this is a sure fire display of it.	2015-08-17

There are two things wrong with this:<br /><br />1.  Zero front side protection.  So never drop it on it's face.<br /><br />2.  The right and left bumpers are not only not protected, the case will BREAK you bumpers if the device is dropped.  The design of the case is poor, if dropped the 2DS will come out or will shift enough to catch on the bottom of the bumpers.  This will cause the bumper to receive all of the force of the fall and pop out the base of the button from the main case.  If your child tries to use it this way, the plastic that holds the bumper in place is thin and will be damaged if attempted to be used after being dislodged.  You have to take the entire back off, not just the battery compartment, and re-seat the bumper and spring.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants to protect their device.  I discovered issue #1 upon opening the package and issue #2 after my son dropped it a few times and the bumpers kept popping out for some reason.	2015-08-17

The gameplay is fast, Graphics are beautiful, and there are for armor classes to choose from. I love the JET ARMOR!

I'd say the game is easily 5 out of 5 stars if you force yourself to only play like 2-3 missions a day.

Loved playing previous version, except the game had a fatal flaw - let the other team get touchdowns off kickoff returns all the time. So, I bought this version.... Has some nice touches, better graphics, the coaching career stuff is nice as I like to do the dynasty building, etc. BUT HUGE ISSUE AROSE: the game freezes up randomly. Someone posted this is due to hard drive size. NOT. This is plain and simple bad coding. There is a coding flaw in how they handle the audio commentary (when are they going to let you turn the annoying talking heads off anyway?! I don't want them, and I don't want replays either - I just want to play!), and also a flaw that seems to appear if you keep cutting the replays short. I suspect bad garbage collection in their code for cleaning up the audio and video when you cut it short. Anyway, it just locked up on me 3 times in a row - enough already. Sometimes it locks up completely, sometimes it keeps showing the panning view of the stadium but never comes back to the game. Either way, you are done. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS GAME. In fact, EA Sports quality is slipping across the board. Sad really.	2015-08-17

My PS3 is used primarily as a video player for my children, and giving them this $15 remote to use is much easier and less costly than the $50 controller, as well as easier for them to use.

Here are the pros and cons. The costumes are nearly the same ones as in DW6. There are new ones too. The strategems, free officer, vagabon leader, and ruler systems added great variety to the gameplay. If used wisely, strategems can be very effective in battle. The free officer system is great as you can jump from kingdom to kingdom and not feel tied down to one area. However, to conquer the map, you must be a ruler. The weapons were my favorite, especially the 6 star weapons. There are some new weapons that were DLC weapons in the past installments. You don't have to pay for them in DW 8 because they come with the game. The officer creation is very detailed and offers a vast number of combinations in regards to facial alignment, body shape, hair/eye/skin color, and much more. I actually was able to make a near-look-alike of Sephiroth, which was really cool. I would recommend this game.	2015-08-17

I was stuck for 3 whole years playing the outdated, poorly developed 2k 13. The show 15 is great in soooooo many ways, from updated roster (which is expected) and graphics.

I am going to tell you the good, the bad and the Nerdy! #BlackNerdComedy<br />The Good:<br />The game opens up with using the character in which you beat/last saved with on Saints Row 4. You have to own or played the last game to play this one. You take control of Johnny Gat or Kenize Kensington via switching at the Ultor HQ in Hell. yes you are in Hell, no surprise huh, especially with all the crime you did in all the previous games. Controls are tight and easily adjusted via the options.Camera has improved greatly and replayablity is something you will and want to do. Side quests and activities are toned down which will appeal to new comers and casuals alike. The game is an easy 8 to 10 hours for activities and main story, which is not bad for an expansion. The game feels more like a quasi sequel than expansion which is also a plus.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Activities and side quests are repetitive, however there is not that many activities which is I would say a plus. Salvation: prevent souls from leaving and/or falling to hell. Torment Fraud: a spin on insurance fraud where you take control of a husk and ram into hell cars in exchanged for time served. HellBlazing: aerial timed race using the wings acquired from Lucifer's Halo. Extraction: a Base takeover type activity along with a few others. I wished it was a bit longer but at this point I am nitpicking.<br /><br />The Nerdy:<br />Johnny Gat and Kenize are voiced by their previous Voice Actors. Johnny Gat's voice actor, Daniel Dae Kim, has voiced the title character since SR1 and is also on Hawaii Five-0. This is first time you play a preexisting character rather than forging a new one. No Cheats or radio stations in this game. Dex is back as a revenge quest. Finally the title is a play on Meat Loaf's Bat Outta Hell album title.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I highly recommend this game for fans and casuals alike. It is worth the money and is a satisfying expansion to a wonderfully fun franchise. I give it a 5 outta 5!derfully fun franchise. I give it a 5 outta 5!	2015-08-17

Graphics are extremely low quality, I mean like textures that are so bad that the lines on character faces are fuzzy. Couldn't this developer do something with the textures? It looks like this was ported from the N64. Seriously, there are some quality N64 games with better texture resolution than the models in this game feature. I was very surprised by the terrible quality. The gameplay is the same old here, absolutely nothing new to surprise me while playing with my daughter. The game would be fun if it were developed for the Wii generation. I don't know if it's just the Wii version or if the Xbox 360, PS3, 3DS, etc, look equally as bad as this. I hate to review a game solely on the graphics--I never do that, I'm not that shallow--except the textures are so bad it's distracting.<br /><br />2 stars for graphics, +1 for gameplay. Sorry, but it really is that bad. Best played on a 15-year old tube TV in SD resolution.	2015-08-17

This is the second PDP product I have owned. The first was a lighted controller for the Xbox 360. That product has served me very well for the past two years, so I figured this one would, as well. How did it measure up?<br /><br />Well, in comparison to my Turtle Beach Xbox One headphones, the sound isn't as good. The Turtle Beach headphones provide a more powerful and cleaner sound, but they are quite a bit more expensive than these. The sound on these is completely adequate, and the fact that they are completely wireless is really nice.<br /><br />The fit on the headphones seems good. I haven't had any problems with them slipping off because they are too loose or giving me a headache because they are too tight. The sizing can be adjusted, and they seem stiff enough that I'm not concerned they will slide from the size I have them adjusted to. The green LED lights look really cool, too! Like the LED controller I own, the lights on these can be turned off to conserve battery life, but I usually leave them on because they look too darn cool to turn them off. Besides, I don't play games for long periods of time so running down the battery isn't a problem I have to concern myself with.<br /><br />Setting up the headphones to run with the Xbox was very easy and too very little time. (You will need to have an open USB port on the system to use them.)<br /><br />I noticed that a lot of other reviewers voiced complaints about the mic. Since I don't really play any online games, this isn't an issue for me. I generally only use headphones so I can play at a volume I like without disturbing anyone else and so I can pick up on small noises in a game without being distracted. My son sometimes plays Destiny multi-player online and uses headphones while doing so. He says the headphones from the Turtle Beach are better and prefers to use them for online  multi-player games. Otherwise, he has been using these new ones. (I think the novelty of the new ones and the cool look are what is driving his usage of them.)<br /><br />For the price, these seem like a very good offering and are well worth the investment!is driving his usage of them.)<br /><br />For the price, these seem like a very good offering and are well worth the investment!	2015-08-17

Even knowing this going in I was amazed by how much there was. So if you are okay with reading a novel in a video game this is for you. If you want gameplay then this isnt for you. I hated all the characters. The ones I liked got killed off early. The game borrows gameplay from other games like persona and virtues last reward but it doesn't do execute it well. Like hanging with classmates like you do in Persona, though you gain skills (that dont help much at all) but you dont feel close with them or create a bond. Most times they end annoyed at you for spending time with them. The visuals look good though. I enjoyed the dark humor and there was enough to keep me glued til the end. Altogether the game was okay. It was a nice break from playing games with actual gameplay but it definitely didn't make me want to play the second one any time soon. Maybe a couple years down the road when i invest in a nice pair of reading glasses.	2015-08-17

This game felt like a step down from the original ghost recon games. Forcing you into a third person prospective basically and throwing way to many guys at you for how easy you die especially on harder difficulties.

US	212283	RRFU8CP3SQ3PG	B008LEW7MQ	448641136	Tera - Exclusively @ Best Buy - The Blue Roan Mount	Video Games	4	2	4	N	Y	Try Before You Buy	I purchased a physical, factory-sealed Best-Buy edition of TERA in July 2015 to obtain the Founder's code inside.<br /><br />Purchasing a physical copy of TERA and redeeming the code on the back of the included manual (be sure to submit it a second time in reverse as well) unlocks Founder status for the account. Three additional bank slots, six additional character slots, 20 additional broker slots, a 280-speed mount, the Founder title and assorted trinkets, all account-wide (across all servers and characters). In addition, you'll receive a BoE (tradeable) 280-speed mount worth north of 10k gold at time of posting.<br /><br />The Best Buy edition also includes a 255-speed Blue Roan mount that is, honestly, completely useless unless you're the type who simply *must* have every mount in the game. The Blue Roan is account-wide as well.<br /><br />So, if you already enjoy TERA and want to either: A) make tons of alts -- or B) eliminate the worry of storage space, I recommend the purchase. This is much cheaper than individually purchasing the included items with En Masse's EMP and makes the inventory-management aspects of the game much less of a hassle. If the standard copy of the game is available (and cheaper), you could potentially save yourself a couple dollars.<br /><br />I take a star off the review because of TERA's design. You'll love the active combat and potentially the aesthetic of TERA. The community varies, as should be expected in any MMO, but if you're into RP or ERP you'll find a home here.<br /><br />This is where the fun ends.<br /><br />Leveling is a grindfest (like many MMORPGs). Quests are utterly horrendous, fetch, repetitive, backtracking drivel (so terrible, they removed side quests altogether in the level 60+ areas later added in an expansion). The active combat is refreshing at first, but the developers fail to capitalize on it with simple and monotonous monster/boss AI and mechanics. If you're into quickly leveling, expect to run the same low-end dungeons 10-15 times, each, per character.<br /><br />Endgame is the worst example of grindfest across the myriad MMORPGs I've dabbled in over the years. Endgame bosses use re-hashed skins and mechanics from low-end dungeons. With each update, the developer's MO is to remove 3-6 dungeons (this is unusual), add or slightly tweak 2-4, and force players to run the same one or two ad nauseam for weeks to &#34;earn&#34; the highest end gear. Within a few months, new gear and a new high-end dungeon will be out, allowing you the opportunity to start the process from scratch again.<br /><br />By endgame, you'll be committed to either 2-6 hours of dailies in an attempt to gear or 2-6 hours of easier dailies across your 6-8 alts to mine currency. You'll absolutely need a guild to break the monotony with their (hopefully) entertaining antics on Comms.<br /><br />Or -- if your time is more valuable than your money -- you can pay-to-win. Expect to pay a lot. Many do.<br /><br />If earning a place at the top through commitment, time and repetitive gameplay (and/or a lot of cash) is your thing, TERA is for you. If you want to casually (or not so casually) roleplay a berserking badger, saintly rock-man, or loli prostitute, TERA is for you. If you want to try the combat mechanics without the commitment, you've no need to spend any money. TERA's F2P. Give it a download and experience the breadth of the universe before making a purchase.	2015-08-17

One of the things that made Skyrim and Oblivion so great was the immense world in which you were able to do whatever you wanted. While this game is free roam, I find myself not having much to do, other than quests. The quests mostly consist of killing a certain amount of cannon fodder and after a while, it feels like grinding without the excitment of receiving new items and leveling up.<br /><br />In short, do not expect this game to play like Skyrim or any of the previous Elder Scroll games. Great to waste time until the next Elder Scrolls blows us away.	2015-08-17

I was skeptical of the game because of many reviews, but I gave it a try and its a great game, I found it more fun than GTA 5 due to its many features and gadgets.  Also the game has little to no drug or sex related stuff, so its a bit safer for younger audience.  Even the Wii U gamepad adds a bit more of fun.  The online play is also very interesting.

You're restricted to completing quests in order of level of difficulty. There's no sense of awe in exploration, because it's an endless chain of running and fast traveling to each quest. You must manually select your next quest every time, as the game chooses them for you in the wrong order, again, every time.<br /><br />Loading Screen Simulator : There's a short loading screen to check your quests, your map, your inventory. There's a loading screen to talk to merchants, a loading screen for people giving you quests, a long loading screen to 'fast' travel, and an even longer loading screen to start the game. Every time you boot it up you are forced to watch a CD project red advertisement, then wait for the start up menu to load, then start your game save load. It's the longest wait i've ever seen to get to a game.<br /><br />You cannot fast travel anywhere until you've been there first.<br /><br />You cannot fast travel anywhere but to sign posts.<br /><br />You must physically be at a sign post to fast travel.<br /><br />Why can't you fast travel anywhere at any time from any place? running to a sign post. fast travel loading screen. running from a sign post.<br /><br />When checking your map to find the destination of your quest, there's no arrow indicating in which direction it is, so you must manually scan the map in every direction to find the quest marker. unbelievable. You must do this over, and over and over again. which direction is the quest marker? how many seconds will you waste looking for it each time? your results may vary.<br /><br />Done talking to an npc? You must watch a cutscene of geralt saying farewell every single time before you can leave.<br /><br />Lag simulaor. The game has constant frame rate issues for no reason. In combat, near water, in a marsh or swamp? you're screwed.<br /><br />Yes, the game has good graphics, but plenty of other games do this at a stable framerate. It's almost like they sabotaged the console ports so Nvidia could sell graphics cards. There's no justification for this garbage. The game is simply unfinished. They forced it out the door too early.<br /><br />Every time the game lagged, it left me wondering why, because nothing impressive is ever going on on screen when it does.<br /><br />Horse AI. god save us. When you whistle to summon your horse, instead of galloping up to you, it walks up to you, forcing you to turn around and run to it. The horse always seems to spawn behind you, forcing you to retrace your steps. the horse should sprint up to you and let you jump onto it like you're legolas. Nope.<br /><br />The horse will stop running for no reason. again and again and again. I bet it did it to me over 500 times. Sometimes it spawns stuck inside a house or any other piece of geometry. It refuses to jump over obstacles, instead running right into them. other times, rarely, it works flawlessly.<br /><br />Animal Abuse. You're forced to make roach carry 'trophies' strapped to the saddle in order to get the combat, gold, or experience bonus they provide. What jerk forces his horse to carry a massive gryphon head everywhere for no reason? You don't even unequip your saddle bags when participating in races. strikingly lazy.<br /><br />Instead of building a relationship with your horse, you improve it's abilities by equipping new saddles and saddlebags. Even of the saddle is bigger, your horse gains stamina. ridiculous.<br /><br />Your relationship with roach should have been one of the best parts of the game, and instead it's the worst. Roach doesn't even know what roads to take when you're riding. Nothing works. Nothing ever friken works.<br /><br />And because roach doesn't know which road to take, you're forced to constantly check your minimap so you know when and where to turn. It makes riding your horse even more of a chore than it already is.<br /><br />Because you need experience to level up, you can't turn down any quest, meaning youcan't make any meaningful choices, yet the developers still leave the option to tell people to go screw themselves.<br /><br />Geralt is constantly trying to be an jerk by telling people he doesn't care or isn't interested in the stories they tell him when he takes a quest. TMI. TMI. TMI. Does he need to be rude to everyone, at all times? These people are explaining their problems to you and offering you money for your help. oh wait, 'witchers are impatient'.<br /><br />chest pieces made out of cloth have better defense stats than the cool looking chainmail armor you start out with?<br /><br />Wild Hunt. An endless hunt for people again and again and again. The plot never changes, you're always wandering around searching for something, everyone wants you to find someone or something for them, a person, a goat, a frying pan, etc, etc. run here looking, run there looking.<br /><br />Using witcher senses can sometimes be frustrating to follow the trail ahead of you, as it is often to faint to spot, and the game often requires you to spot things in order, which causes trouble if you missed something.<br /><br />There's texture pop in too, usually in cities. The game often also blurs and freezes for a short time, also usually in cities.<br /><br />When you find the legendary tools of a derelict and monster guarded forge in skellige, instead of giving these tools to your friends in skellige, you rob them and give it to some random dwarf craftsman in another country. Stealing skellige's heritage? Unbelievably moronic.<br /><br />You can equip mutagens. I never did this, because it makes no sense. As far as I understood, whichers are bonded with mutagens as children, as part of their painful transformation into witchers. So how can geralt equip new ones and unequip old ones on a whim now?<br /><br />Combat can also be frustrating when you get locking into taking damage. Geralt winces as he gets hit over and over and over again without any way to roll out of range or parry / block incoming attacks. It's pretty aggravating when this happens because it feels like geralt is some amateur sword fighter who doesn't know what he's doing. I often lost control of myself and cursed when this happened. The combat is pretty responsive most of the time, but becomes completely unresponsive every time this happens. I don't like control being ripped away from me as I get closer to death with each hit.<br /><br />It's made even more aggravating because even on the lowest difficulty the game can be challenging. My desire not to die and be forced to do more running around made me all the more desperate to escape damage lock, even though it's impossible. But you can try, and I always tried.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />What i suppose to be the last quest in the game, the wild hunt is going to attack, and geralt and friends, so the decide to lock themselves up off in the middle of nowhere, kaer morin.<br /><br />I rage quit the game shortly after learning this. Instead of heading to the formidable nord fortress in skellige, which their king invites you to do, geralt says &#34;i can't risk your soldiers lives' Even though the wild hunt is intent on ending the world, and murdering ciri, geralt's daughter, he refuses to face them anywhere where they could expect help from the locals. Since the wild hunt is a threat to them all, they could choose to fight them literally anywhere where other people are around and expect them to pitch in or at least be a distraction.<br /><br />I liked Ciri, but the developers obviously didn't.can't make any meaningful choices, yet the developers still leave the option to tell people to go screw themselves.<br /><br />Geralt is constantly trying to be an jerk by telling people he doesn't care or isn't interested in the stories they tell him when he takes a quest.

I started the game and was quickly wondering what was going on because the game tells you hardly anything(why you are doing this or who any characters are). Feeling lost that quick I thought maybe if I stick with it they will explain in a bit, I played about 7-8 hours total before just giving up being bored, all it seems to boil down to is defending positions in different areas as the &#34;gameplay&#34;. I feel like they had a good idea of what they wanted to do but just never got there. Maybe I am missing something but I don't see the huge appeal, games need to have a direction or some exposition of why you need to get from point A to B, not just go there and hold this position, now we must activate this other thing at point C for whatever reason. It is fun to try but I feel like 30$ was a waste.	2015-08-17

It made installing my 3.5 inch Hybrid drive a total breeze. My main concern was reinstalling games and losing access to a game that is no longer available on the PS store called P.T. Using an External Terabyte HD, I did a complete full back up of everything. Took 6 hours just for that alone. Then I grabbed a thumb flash drive, looked up the full reinstall PUP file (not the upgrade PUP file) then I was ready. Installation of the Data Bank was unbelievably easy. I think the entire install too about 2 minutes. Then I started it up, the PUP file went in, once installed it was as if I just bought my PS4 fresh from the store. Then I did the Full Restore from the External HD, took 3 hours. One complete, everything was ready, I didn't have to download and reinstall a single game or app. it was all there including P.T. The only thing extra I had to do was Activate As My Primary PS4 and Restore the License's so I can play certain games again (like Batman Arkham Knight). But that's it. During the entire process I kept checking to see if there was any overheating, and there was none. The PS4 gets warm, but no more warmer than it did with the regular HD that it came with. For those who are still concerned with heat, just place the PS4 on a Laptop Cooler. They are very cheap, it covers the entire body of the PS4 and works perfectly. I had one collecting dust and I use it as a precaution. Although it was never really needed, but it does keep the system cooler which is a good thing. if your worried about USB ports (which a Laptop Cooler uses) just get the 5 USB port adapter.. however do not use the 5 USB port adapter when restoring your PS4 after upgrading your Hard Drive. Once everything is installed, then the 5 USB port adapter will work. Enjoy!	2015-08-17

This item is not compatible with the new xbox 360 E model which does not have a toslink (optical) input. I play on a gaming monitor with no optical input so the only way I would be able to get around this is to purchase a separate hdmi converter which would set me back another $40. There is no way of getting an analog signal out of it either just because of the way it is designed. However if you have a tv with an optical input you could hook it up to the tv's optical input. I wish amazon would mention this on the item description. I returned these with no problems at all and purchased the turtle beach x42 and I am very pleased with those. I hope this helps anyone who has run into the same problem as me.	2015-08-17

For me growing up on FF on NES then moving onto more fleshed out games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 2 & 3 this game hearkens back to an age where digital storytelling is told with sprites and a masterful soundtrack. Although the graphics and the way your characters move about the map is very 'dated' by most standards the challenging game play and character interaction makes up for any modern downfalls. I do wish this game would have had a better localization, voice acting would have been nice but there is so much text and for a niche game it wasn't possible economically. I do wish they would have left in the raw Japanese. If you have ever played a Growlanser game then you know its like a soap opera for JRPG fans, very dramatic music and events and never a dull moment. You most likely will need a faq because navigating around is a pain unless you have an eidetic memory lol All the potential negatives aside the branching story lines, OST, characters, and just the overall 'feels' make this game worth with weight in gold. If difficulty and older style of graphics and non streamlined approach turns you off, dont bother.	2015-08-17

It seems like a really good quality product, but the games available are pretty lame. I thought the playroom might entertain my three year old girl a bit, but it's quite underwhelming. Still, the future is bright for this camera. With the VR release in the first part of next year, it should become a mandatory accessory.<br />[UPDATE] Have used it with nba 2k. Lost the screenshot i took after my iPad was soaked and ruined but my face scan turned out okay. It's tough to tell because it looks so different on a 6-8 guy. They seemed to take a lot of accurate point measurements, but e final product is a little weird. Still, better than any other I have used. 5 stars from 4.	2015-08-17

It seemed like a lot of simmers hated it compared to the sims3. I've been playing sims since the original sims and was expecting the sims4 to be immaculate. The game does deliver in some areas,  but in others it makes me want to chunk my laptop out the window.  Here's my list of pros/cons:  1) create a sim pro: this is by far the best CAS. I love the graphics and the push/pull effects. Clothes are nice too. Con: you can't really customize colors and patterns. But the clothes are actually modern clothes and have good color choices so this doesn't bother me.  2) building houses pro: you can pickup rooms and move them instead of demolishing them if your not happy with placement. The doors and windows are way better than sims3. You can have average wall height or high celings with one click instead of building two stories to make a high celings. Cons: it is hard as hell to get use to! It's basically the same as sims3, but on crack. I find myself making walls without even clicking on the lot. The camera is way different than sims 3 too. You can either look flat at your house or straight on top of the house. No camera tilting like sims3. Which is a pain when building. 3) the world. I love how they set up the world. There is 3 neighborhoods to choose from and your not limited to that neighborhood like the other sims games. You can live in one area then go to the park in another.  Con: there's not a town view like sims3. Each neighborhood has 4 buildings you can visit (gym, library, ect) and you have to &#34;travel&#34; to get there. No cars.  4) live sim mode. Pro: there are so many more interactions and sims do seem to tend to themselves. I'm not constantly clicking the toliet or fridge to help keep them maintained they do take the initiative to do stuff on their own. Con: you can't really influence them at work/school like &#34;make new friends&#34; &#34;suck up to boss&#34;to help boost their levels of achievement or gain friends. I made a child and after 1 sims week he still had 0 relationships other than his parents. So you actually have to make an effort to be social. 5) items. Pro: there is ALOT of stuff that comes with the sims4 base game. There is a little something for every sim. Some stuff that would only be available through and expansion pack (like the piano in late night) now comes with the base game. You can have anything from a wood workers bench to a rocketship. Cons: I personally haven't missed anything except for there's no cars, and no swings or bikes for children. But that doesn't effect me. However someone else might have been wanting something that wasn't included.  There is several other things I could write about but let's face it, neither of us have all day. My advise would be to each some videos on YouTube so you can kind of see the sims4 in action. Like I said before, there's alot of negative reviews about this game. But I really enjoy playing it.   Also, I ordered this game almost a year after it had been released hoping EA would have worked some of the bugs out. Well, right off the bat it said I had to update the game to the latest patch or I couldn't play it. It took SIX HOURS TO UPDATE! I had several problems with it throwing out an error codr, I had to update it in safe mode just to get the update to work. So anyone who is purchasing it now... you have been warned.  Hope this helps =)	2015-08-17

The case is mainly in my opinion designed for visual aesthetics, do not count on this case to save it from a fall or drop. My only gripe about this case is that it obstructs the front camera a bit. It also covers the playstation button just a tad. It's designed for the PS Vita, but the dimensions of the case don't align that well with the product itself.

The sound effects are bad, there is no story mode. I really wanted to like this game, but I don't ever play it. The worst part is 2/3 of the game is DLC. You're going to pay another $15, which I did, just to get a complete experience.	2015-08-17

I haven't played and had access to a copy for a while, considering buying it here, but it was a great game. Its only downfall and my reason for knocking off a star, is the terrible English Voice acting. But guess what, it's already a Japanese styled SRPG, it has the option for the obviously vastly superior Japanese dub, so..USE IT and enjoy an otherwise great game.<br /><br />I loved this game for the tons of awesome characters and remember enjoying the story and it just being a great SRPG with plenty of skills, characters, and levels. It's styled like Phantom Brave with the circular boundary for attacking and moving, rather than your typical grid based SRPG. Chaos Wars is actually the reason I bought and now enjoy the Shadow Hearts series. I think in Chaos Wars he was called Uru, but I loved using him in this game, eventually sought out Shadow Hearts since it was one of the few non Japan only games featured in Chaos Wars.<br /><br />All in all, as long as you use Japanese voices with subs, I find this to be a fun and enjoyable Japanese styled SRPG. It has plenty of levels, skills, characters and story. Was a very fun game to play.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-  The Japanese voice acting is a perfect fit<br />- Tons of characters<br />- Plenty of levels/places to battle at<br />-  Fun game to play<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Mainly just the horrendous English voice acting, but Japanese dubbing with subs, is an available alternative.	2015-08-17

Sometimes I use the soundbar + OEM ear piece combo but these headphones are the preferred option (like any headphones, do they get uncomfortable after a while-although these are among the lightest I've ever worn).  don't expect audiophile grade sound emanating from these cans-these are meant for casual use and there are clearly better sounding options out there, but then you're looking at the $300+ range (e.g., astro, audio technica/senns gaming headphones).	2015-08-17

Ok, I know I'm saying a lot here but Modnation Racers is the best kart racing game I have ever played.  And I'm including all of the Mario Kart games and the games that were based off of the genre that it originated.  Modnation Racers (for the PS3) is the most fun and deepest kart racing game ever made.  The turbo meter management mechanic works amazingly well.  Offensive and defensive moves are unmatched in any other kart racing game that I ever played by far.  Side swiping opponents, force fields for defending yourself from getting hit by other racers, and the turbo meter are only some things that I can't imagine not having in a kart racing game from this point on.  People are still playing this game online to day and the game is over 5 years old!  There's even 4 player split screen and 2 player split screen for online races.  If you're in the market for a really fun and addictive kart racing game, this is the best one to buy.  It's even better (a lot better actually) than it's successor, Little Big Planet Karting.  That game feels like 2 steps backwards in comparison.  And making your own mods, karts, and tracks are super easy and fun to do. Racing your friends or anyone on the tracks that YOU created with the mods and karts that YOU made or favorites that you downloaded online for free is a gift that keeps on giving for endless hours of enjoyment.  Modnation Racers for PS3.  I can't recommend this game enough.  5 stars.	2015-08-17

I found nothing wrong with this game, and I thought the story line for the most part was great.  I said most part, because I couldn't stand how it ended.  First game I completed on my Xbox One.  I'm going to go into a little more.  Like I said, the story line in my opinion was strong, just pay attention, it's really good!  Now I will admit there were times when I wanted to throw my controller, because you have to time attacks right, or when you go to fight a boss and you think you have him down.. only for him to split into 6 other characters that you must defeat, I had words coming out of my mouth that should not have been coming out.  So there are some difficult parts.  But like I said, really enjoyed this game and couldn't put it down.  The graphics were spot on and the story made it even better.  I did have to google the last part though because I couldn't figure out what to do.  It was simple, just need to pay attention.  Very well done game!!	2015-08-17

Final Fantasy XIII gets far more hate than it deserves.  The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is great, and the story is good.<br />I recommend playing the game with the mini-map off for the majority of your play time.  Taking that away from the screen opens the whole world up to your senses.  You feel a lot less linear and find yourself using your brain more to move your character from point A to point B.  There are so many small details and beautiful graphical effects to enjoy!  The Soundtrack is a MASTERPIECE.  (Thank you, Masashi Hamauzu!)<br /><br />The characters in this game seem to be generally disliked, but if you take the time to sit down and really relate to these people....they're much more likeable than you'd think.  I've seen people just hate them for their character flaws (Lightning is a stoic boring heartless character blegh, Hope is a whiny baby - get some balls) and I'm like....why are you judging them for their flaws and nothing else?<br />How about WHY they act that way?  What are they dealing with in their personal lives right now?  And do they change at all?  What bonds are formed between these characters?<br /><br />And the scenes where no words are used and there's only music and movement to tell a story?<br />Those scenes touch my heart so much.<br /><br />Just you wait for a scene in PalumPolum involving Hope, Snow, and Lightning's Knife.	2015-08-17

HEATED	when I pulled the the box from the main package,l there where scratches all around the top corners and a hole ripped through the middle. I had planned on keeping the box as a collectors item but ended up throwing it away. The contents where for the most part unscathed, but as I sorted through them I noticed there was no controller. I had also ordered another controller along with the Xbox so out of anticipation I plugged it in and started getting the box set up. I hadn't noticed the Halo game inside the packaging so I assumed it must have been pre-installed onto the hard drive, but when I check the my games and apps tab there is nothing. I go out to our trash can and dig to find the original box hoping that a code card that will allow me to download the game is inside, but to no avail. Now i'm browsing the xbox menus aimlessly with no games.	2015-08-17

I'm glad that they did, as I much prefer using the wireless Dual Shock 3/4 controllers rather than have a portable system with a bulky cable sticking out the back like the PSP did.<br /><br />It's capable of scaling the games from their native resolution of 960x544 to either 480p, 720p or 1080i (NOT 1080p). It starts out of the box in 480p for compatibility, and you can easily change the resolution in the Settings app to suit your display. 720p is probably the best choice for action games as it's a progressive resolution, but you will get (slightly) better picture quality out of 1080i.<br /><br />This little device is pretty slick. It's quite tiny, with the length being just enough to harbor the power jack, HDMI port, USB port, Vita memory card and power button. The shorter side harbors the physical game slot.<br /><br />The DC adapter has been done right where it doesn't terminate in a wall wart, but instead has the AC section in the middle of the cable.<br /><br />One annoyance I have with the physical design, is that the game card slot is designed just like it is on the Vita. You use your fingernail to pull out the dust cover that's permanently attached by two pieces of rubberized plastic and push the game in, making it nearly impossible to do with one hand. I would have much rather had a hinged cartridge slot in place of that so you could just push and click the game into place.<br /><br />This thing can also stream video from your PS4, so you can play your PS4 from another room with this thing hooked up. I don't currently own a PS4 though, so I can't really talk at length about that. All I can say is that the PS4 and PSTV support Wireless N... but you probably won't have a great streaming experience unless both of them are hooked up via Gigabit Ethernet which is highly impracticalin most cases.<br /><br />The reason behind the 4 star rating: Not every game that's released for the Vita is compatible with this system. I can certainly understand games that specifically require the touch interface to not be compatible for obvious reasons, but it's not limited to those games. It's up to the developers whether or not they want to support the PSTV, and even some games that have been made compatible in Japan, NEVER get updated in other regions (examples such as Ys: Memories of Celceta and Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1).<br /><br />This same issue reaches to PSP and PS1 Classics where most of them are not compatible, even though there's no foreseeable reason why they're not.<br /><br />The other negative thing I've noticed is the cut and dry version of the PS Store on the device. You're unable to see if there are sales going on for any products when you're browsing the store on the PSTV, but you're more than able to do so on the Vita handheld or the Playstation Store's website. I'm not sure why the differentiation between the app stores, but it certainly does annoy me now that I've seen them side by side.<br /><br />Overall, for the prices these things go for now, they're a great value, especially for games that beg to be on a larger screen. I would say the original price of $100-120 was ludicrous for what this thing is, but now that they're almost universally available for less than $50? It's a worthwhile appliance.	2015-08-17

I bought these on Prime Day, because they looked like a great deal, and I needed a new headset to upgrade from the cheap one that comes with the XBOX 360. After using them for about a month, I can say that I like them. The biggest complaint I have is the mic. I think it looks cool to have it be so low profile, but it isn't super functional. I have to talk pretty loud for it to pick up my voice. It gets annoying when the people I'm playing with online keep saying &#34;What?&#34; because I wasn't talking loud enough for the mic to pick it up.<br />The sound on this headset is its' biggest redeeming quality. When I have it on surround sound mode it sounds pretty amazing. BO2 sounds great, and I've also listened to music and it sounds great as well.<br />Overall, I probably would recommend against buying this headset, unless you can find them for cheap like I did. They're several years old, the mic is below average, and it's kinda tricky to get them all connected if you have the newest version of the XBOX 360.	2015-08-17

Don't let the title fool you, this has some Dragonball in it as well, just a little mind you, but still great attention to detail in the scenes, and it gives you a better understanding of the characters. Those who grew up with Z only will probably be disappointed this doesn't get to the more iconic frieza fight (I'd for one love a sequel too) but to learn more about the characters, and how weak they started out really makes the saiyans a more daunting foe, as well as the fact they bring back lesser known moves from Z, such as the evil containment wave. These were big in Dragonball, but later in Z got kind of overshadowed by more impressive attacks. If you're a fan of either show though, you'll really appreciate it. The gameplay itself is standard turn based RPG, it is possible to grind easily as you he's after every level gained, but not needed to beat anyone in the game really, especially if you want a challenge. The moves have flashy demonstrations and a good balance of special vs. standard attacks. I'd give this game a 5 star simply for the attention to detail in the lore, as well as the art, both sprite and portrait, and being a solid game gameplay wise. Would love a sequel in the way, and even a prequel to start from the beginning of Dragonball.	2015-08-17
US	159566	R2912DCUNFEP1S	B00YXOYHVM	900251835	Xbox One 1TB Console - Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle	Video Games	5	0	0	N	Y	A Must-have For Any Counsel Fan	While the Xbox One is has met a large amount of criticism from its release date to current, I believe it is a well refined product worthy of some praise. Here are a quick list of pros and cons that I found from using it for about a month now.<br /><br />Pros<br />- The difference in graphics between the 360 and the One are night and day. Anything from frame rate to clarity to resolution is vastly improved. This allows those 1080p TVs do do what they were made for.<br />- The sleek design and interface are crisp, clean, and simple. It did take some getting used to when finding most of the systems functions as Ive been using the 360 for over 4 years.<br />- The game selection is finally becoming something. With all of the titles currently released and the titles that have been announced as being in the works or in development for the One, this system has become a must have for all counsel gaming fans.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Between the space taken up from the operating system and the fact that each game you play must first be downloaded, the 500gb counsel is woefully short on storage space. That being said, for anyone hoping to oven more than 10 or so games needs to have the 1tb counsel or an external storage for their 500gb counsel.<br />- While playing Far Cry 4, I found that while the overall graphics are vastly improved (which allows the game to shine for what it is whereas the 360 ruins it), I noticed that the frame rate did suffer in some larger gunfights or exploration.<br /><br />The Halo MCC is a masterpiece. As a rather casual Halo fan having played each game back when each was released, this collection is by far the best thing to happen to the Halo franchise yet. Its remastered soundtracks and cut-scenes improve the overall theatrical feeling of the games beyond what words can describe. I have not a single regret about buying this bundle.	2015-08-17

I figured for just a bit more than the price of a package of screen protectors I could get the case, earbuds, styluses and screen protector!  What a deal I thought, but sadly it was not meant to be....  The black case is alright, not much padding for the Wii U controller but it does offer some protection.  There isn't much you can say about the styluses, they work...  The earbuds are alright for cheap earbuds.  The biggest problem I had with this was the screen protector.  It was a perfect size and went on easily, but the Wii U wouldn't recognize the controller after we applied it!  We tried everything we could think of but to no avail, the Wii U wouldn't work.  As soon as we removed the screen protector from the screen everything went back to working fine.  Since we already had a case for the controller and the main reason for purchasing this was the screen protector I am disappointed with this purchase.	2015-08-17

I'm a working adult and I have played the Wii U maybe twice a month since my purchase and my console already has technical issues not accepting game disks that I am inserting. This is unacceptable for a system that is less than 6 months old and is not used with frequency. I called Nintendo and they do not offer to repair it for free, despite the fact that this is clearly a factory defect issue. Instead I'm being charged a $99 fee to repair the issue. Apparently, they explained that a warranty had to be purchased separately which I'm not even sure Amazon even offered. As a Nintendo fan, I'm very disappointed in this console and in Nintendo's lack of customer satisfaction.	2015-08-17

Looking back a few weeks after finishing this game, I think it was a lacking experience compared to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. However, the gameplay and technology advances are impressive. Arkham Knight is impressive technically and visually it is a feast. It doesn't have a narrative punch, or suspense that Batman could indeed fail from saving Gotham. But the complaints on the overuse of the Batmobile are valid, it's good once you get all of the upgrades; Batman is awesome, once you upgrade to the max as well. The game lacks interesting use of villains, innovations as it relates to challenges already seen in the earlier games of the series. The narrative in Arkham Asylum - as it relates to Thomas Wayne's stewardship to Amadeus Arkham and he conducting experiments on inmates - the same that Batman must know capture, was chilling. Arkham Knight lacks such ideas.	2015-08-17

This product is somewhat difficult to use esp the upgrade process which was made much easier with YouTube videos. Additionally there are many loops to jump through if you are a Mac user. The software requires that you have a virtual machine installed on you Mac, but the programs are only compatible with certain ones. The free one that they suggest is Virtual Box, which does not support Windows 7 FYI. Once you endure the pain of the initial setup the device does what it's suppose to, with some minor connectivity issues with the BT dongle provided and its maximum working distance. I would suggest this product with extreme hesitancy, if you're tech savvy and don't mind searching forums or YouTube for issues then this will work for you, if not then just spend the money and get a modded controller, which I ended up doing.	2015-08-17

The toony art style might not be for everyone, I understand that, but it is still a great adventure and story.<br /><br /> It looks really beautiful in high definition. The lighting especially is really nice looking and majestic.<br /><br />The controls are really a nice change and an improvement. Being able to swap your inventory with a touch screen is great and the sea chart feels like it was made for the game pad. This remaster is more than just visuals!<br /><br />Hero mode is a nice addition to make the game a little more challenging for older players and people who have played this game before. It makes it so that there are no hearts to be found in the world ( there are still heart pieces) and enemies deal double the damage. Good luck taking on the final boss in this mode! Good thing you can turn it on or off any time through out the game.<br /><br />The swift sail is a very handy addition allowing you to change the direction of the wind without using the windwaker. It also greatly speeds up the time it takes to travel. One of the draw backs of this is that it makes the world feel small! It's not a complaint it's just hard not to notice this effect.<br /><br />This game is all about the story and the game play. The gameplay is great especially with the new controls and the story is grand as always.<br /><br />This game belongs in my greatest games of all time list. But, I don't blame you if the cartoon art style isn't for you.	2015-08-17

It's 5 years old, and I'm wondering why these games that show PC on the cover don't work for my computer. When I put them in my computer a box comes up that says it's not compatible with my computer and says something about 64-bit. My computer information states this is a Genuine Windows 7 Home premium, 64bit. So, I've bought 4 of the cd-roms and only been able to play 2 of them. How do I know, in the future, which of these cd-roms will play in my computer. I don't like wasting all this time and money. Is there some way you can help me to understand which will work for me. I LOVE these Freddie Fish games, I would buy every one you have, but am afraid to order more.there's nowhere, that I know of in my town, that sells them off the shelf.	2015-08-17

When my mom first bought this for me about six months or so ago, I liked it. The stylus worked well, and has a pretty good build. However, the reason I give this three stars instead of four or five is because I have found that over time the stainless steel on the stylus oxidizes with the aluminum pocket in the 3ds xl (if it is kept there when not in use). This eventually results in an uncomfortably &#34;rusty&#34; texture after a while. As a result I have replaced it and chose to keep it in one of the stylus holders that is on my current 3ds xl protective pouch. My suggestion is that if you insist on buying this, it might be best to avoid putting it in the 3ds's stylus pocket.	2015-08-17

Save for the add-ons, they really turn it up to 11.	Great wheel. I used to have a force GT, which was a great all around good value. As soon as I tried this wheel I could not believed the level of realisim and feedback one gets. I've used it in Forza 5, Dirt Rally and most recently Horizon 2. On horizon 2 the Force feedback really shines thru.<br /><br />I do have to admid however that the stock configuration is not ideal. The standard wheel feels toy like. Too plastic. The pedals are not bad, if you don't miss the 3 pedal. And yes, mine broke too. I got a replacement back within a week free of charge. Those things happen.<br /><br />My setup has the TH8A shifter, T3PA pedals, and the Ferrari GTE wheel. All toghether it comes to be a little on the expensive side, but you can minimize cost by looking around for deals. All things considered this setup ultimatelly comes up to be slightly lower, or at worst at the same price as the competition from what I've seen. Also if you are a racing fan, it is a small price to pay for the experience, as it is safer and way cheaper than real racing. :P<br />I have the F1 wheel too, but I haven't used much since I mostly do Horizon now a days. Hopefully when Forza 6 comes, I'll be hable to give it some hours.<br /><br />For the seat frame, I opted to build my own. A couple of boards from a hardware store and some screws are cheaper than any decent setup I saw online. It may not look pretty, but then again I don't think a racing seat and some tubes look pretty in any living room either. I painted mine mat black, and when lights are off, all I see is the screen. Building it yourself, you can setup your sitting possition as you like, I went for something similar to an LMP/F1 seating possition. it is nice.<br /><br />*** Make sure, whatever the base you use for it it is sturdy, not only strong, but also stiff. The forced feedback is really strong, really strong. It gives real feel and feedback, think about turning the wheels in a non powersteered car. If the frame is not sturdy it will deflect and you will loose some of the feel. You can dial down the feedback, but according to me, if you are paying that much for a setup you might as well get the most out of it. ***<br /><br />To recap. Great wheel, great value (especially for XB1), considered what is on the market. If you can, save for the add-ons, they really turn it up to 11. Sturdy base needed.<br /><br />If you have any questions let me know.	2015-08-17

Well I want to give my honest review now that we see just what we got out of Warlords. Blizzard didn't deliver! There is next to no end game content outside of raiding. Professions are gutted and almost no longer matter. The Garrison is worse then flying. It took everyone out of the world and put them into their own phased plot they never have to leave. Honestly you can level up inside your Garrison and never leave it. That is a broken system.<br /><br />&#34;Spoiler Alert&#34; Please do not read on if you do not want to know about the story.<br /><br />It ended so bad. We didn't even have the end boss we expected. It was Archimonde not Grom or Gul'dan and after the fight after all the people Grom killed and after all the damage he caused it was like all was forgiven. He yells Draenor is free end everyone cheers and celebrates with him. He should have been brought to trail and punished for his crimes. So none of any of it makes a lick of sense. Worst of all I didn't care about Draenor or any of the worlds characters other then Maraad from out timeline who lost his life in a not very memorable way. Yrel should have died... Not him.<br /><br />The story is just so broken. It is very obvious Blizzard stopped work on this expansion early. I can only hope for everything Warlords has lacked. Legion the next expansion will make up for. Seriously do not start your WoW experience playing this expansion. Stop at Mists of Pandaria or wait till the release of Legion.<br /><br />If you start here there is a good chance you will put it down and never pick it back up and that just isn't fair to do to yourself. WoW was a great game. Warlords of Draenor just missed the mark and Blizzard can do better.<br /><br />One final note... The high scores here tell me and I want to confirm. The leveling experience is great. It is very enjoyable and a well told story as you progress. Trouble is it is super linear and has little to no replay value. So again if a player has had Warlords a few days to weeks expect high ratings. People like myself who have played since release and have made it this far have a very different song to sing.ys to weeks expect high ratings.

Just a disclaimer: this review is coming from someone in their late 30s who has seen the show Adventure Time, but could not be considered a huge fan of it. However, I am a gamer...so there's that.<br /><br />I was attracted to this game because of the demo I downloaded on the Nintendo 3DS e-shop. It reminded me of a cross between Zelda 2 and the old Dragon Warrior games on the NES.  It has the top-down view when traveling between lands, with random battles popping up while walking. Then, it switches to a side-scroller when going through towns or dungeons.<br />The art is quite cute, and the graphics are done nicely; resembling the cartoon. There is decent humor that is on par with the show as well.<br />The 3D is done quite well also.<br /><br />I enjoyed the game, however I found it to be quite easy...resulting in the 4 star rating. There is not a lot of difficulty, but this is most likely geared toward someone much younger than me. The biggest challenge comes from trying to figure out where to go to next, with back-tracking taking up a considerable amount of time. Although I found the revisiting of areas somewhat annoying, it helped make the game last longer.<br /><br />I really liked the music used throughout, especially in the &#34;haunted woods&#34; levels. I also liked the variety of settings each stage takes place in. The characters you interact with are both funny and cute.<br /><br />I would recommend this as a light-hearted game that anyone could pick up and enjoy, especially if you like the old adventure games like Zelda and Actraiser. It seems to be made for younger gamers, due to the difficulty level, but it shouldn't distract anyone from giving it a try!	2015-08-17

Zipper slides easily and the bag can take some abuse.  The print on the outside was a bit of fun as my son pointed out the characters he doesn't have yet.  The swap force base fit nicely on the side.  I also really like the fact that the case only has a place for the base and then one separator as opposed to having individual compartments.  It allows you to put a lot of Skylanders in the case AND plays more to my son's cleaning style, which typically is throw into bag and zip.  The fact that the top flips out to a mat that you can put your base and Skylanders is great.  It helps contain the mess even when my son is playing.	2015-08-17

This is a great game for the fans of the manga and anime Hajime no Ippo.<br /><br />At the beginning you play with Ippo but afterwards you unlock other characters like Volg Zangief, Ichiro Miyata, Ryo Mashiba, etc.<br /><br />I love it that the game also features alternate timelines, for example if you manage to beat Eiji Date with Ippo. Another big feature are the cutscenes before the fights. The only drawback I found is that in Ippo's storyline you don't get to fight Gero-michi (though maybe he is unlocked later in the game... I don't know).<br /><br />The game is fully in Japanese (both audio and text) but it's compatible with US PS3s.	2015-08-17

The Handsome Collection combines the 3rd and 4th games in the series and while, after playing the two subsequent games, I thought that these two recent titles would see this invented genre played out and repetitive, I found that they only refueled my passion for Boredlands franchise.<br /><br />Playing solo can become a bit tedious for most but when playing co-op, whether online or on the same couch, the fun factor turns all the way up to 11. I never get tired of roaming wastelands with my best friend.<br /><br />The games look and play beautifully on the Xbox One but the reason I have given this collection 4 stars is I feel that this deep into the collection that is Borderlands, I feel 2K could have changed it up a bit/given us more diversity. I still stand by that the games are a blast to play but they leave you wishing there was just a bit more.	2015-08-17

Its extremly easy and does not require any thinking.<br /><br />The first problem any trading game has, is the balance between giving the Player enough feedback so he always knows whats going on and still not making the game too easy by giving too much info.<br />The second problem any trading game has is to balance the degree of automisation, so it doesnt become a chore, and the amount of needed management, so it doesnt become boring.<br /><br />Patrician IV fails both of these tasks by being &#34;too user friendly&#34;.<br />The trading Screen has for each tradegood a bar with 4 stages, that shows how much is in stock in the city, which directly translates to the price being given. This is very easy to understand and makes the player just buy everything that has 2 bars or more and sell everything in his ship that has 1 or 0 bars. The production of goods is decently distributed, meaning you almost never produce 2 things in adjacent cities and never in 3 adjacent cities. So there is no thinking involved, no &#34;valuable trade route finding&#34; or anything, the player can just go from any random port the next random port, buy anything thats fairly cheap and sell it in the next. Even if he doesnt get to sell something he can always just hold on to it for the next port, the ships have huge loading capacities and the player enough money to buy anything from the start so there is no opportunity cost, buy it all. Money flows like crazy.<br /><br />However, this is not even needed, since the player can make traderoutes and just tell the AI to &#34;Auto-Trade&#34; any good the ai wants to. This means that the AI does EXACTLY the same thing of buying anything cheap and selling anything non-cheap, only that the player doesnt need to do anything anymore besides press the spacebar for 10x speed and watch the hundreds of thousands of gold pile up in his account every 5 minutes real time or so. I just started a new game, played a little more than an hour and now have a tradefleet of about 10 Ships, Am Producing 6 Goods in 3 Cities and still have almost a million in the bank. (The Cog, the biggest Ship in the early game, costs ~50k, so 1 Million means you have basically unlimited money.)<br /><br />The Production is weak, meaning that usually you need to build a resource in a city and then the final product (never consisting of more than one raw-material) in a different city for no other reason than the game mechanic. (why cant I make meat in Lübeck, is Lübeck a hostile environment to cows? Why can't I produce beer in Stockholm, do the Sweedish people not know how to make beer and are entirely resistant to learning it?) However, this is still not hard (even though the Trade-Route-Screen could use a major rehaul and, when doing anything but the automated-trade-thing mentioned earlier quite user unfriendly and requires more thinking to press the right buttons, than thinking about the trade route is required) and the effect is having even more money, since for example produced meat is worth so much money, that even selling it in the meat-abundant-city where you produce it (where anyone produces it, due to the mechanic mentioned before) makes a huge profit.<br /><br />All in all, the game is just way too easy, the player has way too much money, &#34;minmaxing&#34; or fiddling with the own traderoutes is not necessary since the most complicated traderoute will most likely not yield as much as the &#34;trade all&#34; and even if it did, the &#34;trade all&#34; route requires about 8 Clicks and, in opposition to the own traderoute, which you spent so much time on creating, will work forever, since the AI automatically adapts to changes in the economy.<br /><br />So besides the mechanics of the game what else is there to say?<br /><br />The Graphics are somewhat decent, its not beautiful, but for an economic/trading Sim, its OK, except that I find the Cities to look horrible. EVERY City is build like aCrecent around the harbour, so theres the harbour and then theres a ring of buildings, followed by another ring of buildings and followed by the ROUND city walls. If it gets extended, it gets a 3rd ring of building. THIS IS NOT WHAT CITIES LOOK LIKE! Thank god you will spend the enire game looking at the mapscreen, which is remarkably undetailed for a game where you spend about 90% of your time staring at it (even if you trade yourself, you dont need to enter the cities for that, goodsexchange can be done via the map) like this and, even though the ONLY valid information on it is the cities, these are drawn quite small.<br /><br />Sound is ok, meaning there is none, except the constant ringing of a bell when a Ship enters the harbour which you will either hate to your guts or simply not hear at all anymore after some time which makes the whole excercise rather pointless, and the dialogs of the other Merchants which always say the same (even though they have different voices, so someone actually thought it would be a good idea to get 6 voiceactors or so, and have them all say the same exact same thing.) become repetetive after the first half an hour, but can be clicked away.<br /><br />There is a campaign, which is a &#34;slow&#34; tutorial, meaning it has 0 Story (Spoiler: Youre a merchant. Your advisor is your Uncle. Thats all.) introduces all the mechanics over the couse of a couple of hours and basically works excatly like the free game, only that it gives you missions like &#34;reach this-or-that-rank&#34; which you automatically succeed in by just playing the game or holding the spacebar)<br /><br />Combat is just plain bad, nothing more to say. You have rather little influence on it and even if you did, it would still be boring. Its just up to 6 Ships (3 each side) circling each other and shooting every couple of seconds while you stare at your watch, wondering when its finally over.<br /><br />Also, there is very little variety to the gameplay. Trading one resource feels like trading the other, since ships are not specialized in resources but carry everthing. Producing one product feels like any other, since its always just made from one other Resource. Theres only 3 Ships in the beginning, and while it gets a LITTLE more varied later on, by that time you will have ~30 Cogs cruising the seas, each and every one doing the same thing.	2015-08-17

For the Xbox one  you have to have a blue tooth  connection. Or the headset will power off every five minutes. You also will be reminded every ten or five seconds that your better is low. I also notes  hairline fractures all over the adjusting part. If you wear glasses uncomfortable.<br />On a side not you will need to spend ten dollars for a chat cable. You also can't write a review on turtle beach website. Also very difficult to navigate the sit as well. I would spend the thirty more dollars on astro a 50.	2015-08-17

This controller works fine	The gamecube controller has always been my favorite. This controller works fine, though the hardware feels cheap. It's not the same quality that I would expect from Nintendo. The L and R buttons take more force to press down and don't have analog triggers, which has made playing a small handful of games annoying. The C stick and D-pad are not as responsive as I would like either. For playing emulations of classic gamecube games, it's pretty good. For playing modern games, not so much. As far as I know, there is no way to re-bind each key, so you may be stuck with a layout you don't want, and occasionally, games don't recognize the controller at all.	2015-08-17

The custom setting with razer synapse is great. when I bought this I had no idea is was wired and wireless, when opened the box I was little confused thinking it was wired. With it being either is great but I am more happy that I can swap out the cord as my last 2 gaming mice failed due to the wire failing. With all that being said the 4 stars come with issue I have with wireless. When using wireless and battery goes dead, my mouse only came with one usb cord not sure I am missing one so when swap to wired mode to charge the mouse and switch back the wireless the  mouse doesn't reconnect unless I restart. This is pain and I going try purchase a random usb cord and try and see if i can fit in to wireless transmitter as it got a fancy end to it and see if the mouse will function with both wired and wireless running. even if it does I still leaving it at 4 stars because they should of given 2 usb cords for the dual functions. If someone reads this and got 2 usb cord with it let me know and I will just yell at the refrub company that sold me mouse and forgot a usb cord because usb cords are only few dollars and I can't see why they wouldn't give me a extra with this price tag for a mouse. I am also using vespula mouse pad bought few months back not planning on buying a razer mouse and let me tell you this pad and mouse together are amazing.	2015-08-17

I've seen a lot of 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapters all over the internet, but this appears to be the least expensive option that guarantees Xbox One chat functionality. That being said, I bought ONE solely to extend the life of my higher end x41's. Would love to have purchased another one or two to do the same with my cheaper 360 headests for when I have buddies over (as opposed to buying all new XB1 headsets), but can't justify it at the $9 price point.	2015-08-17

Purchased these to replace the thumbsticks on my PS4 after one of them had become damaged by a visiting gnawing toddler. I had read that these would work and that some people preferred them over the existing PS4 thumbsticks. I felt I needed to try them myself.They definitely do not disappoint.<br /><br />The original PS4 thumbsticks sit 5/16&#34; above the face of the controller where these sit 7/16&#34;, the increased height is noticeable, and I notice my thumbs cramping less when using them.  The texture of the thumbsticks is harder and less rubbery than the original thumbsticks, textured on the sides and easier to grip just the edge of the thumbstick.  The top area of the thumbstick is a little smaller than the original PS4 sticks, mostly due to the rounded edges instead of sloped edges.<br /><br />I will buy these again. Also kudos to the shipper for sending a free pair of thumbstick grips with them, though I may never use them, it was much appreciated.	2015-08-17

This game was pretty bad i bought it cuz it was cheap and its just bad. Apparently the n64 one and pc were way better but the ps1 version is bad with bad graphics, controls, and bad everything. People should avoid this version	2015-08-17

US	159566	R3H3FYO2EAWT5J	B00KAED7OC	666776757	Far Cry 4	Video Games	5	1	1	N	Y	The scenery is beautiful, the AI a bit more responsive	The Far Cry games were reinvented twice and each time they were nothing short of gold. Far Cry 4 does not see a return of this reinvention strategy but it does improve upon the feel of the last game. The scenery is beautiful, the AI a bit more responsive, and the Multiplayer slightly more fun to play. The co-op was something I had been praying would be included since the first game but what disappointing me was the lack of split screen. Often you can find yourself online playing with someone without a mic and not knowing what they want and not being able to communicate strategy. Overall this subtracts from the experience but not enough to warrant a lesser score.<br /><br />The addition of Karma events in the campaign was interesting. Originally I enjoyed stumbling upon a stray captive and guard and the occasional gunfight was even exciting but by far, the worst thing about this game, was the endless gunfire. If you happen to be exploring near one of the rebel/army shootouts, the distant gunfire will never stop unless you run away or hunt them down and kill everyone there. Just assisting the rebels would give you any peace because soon after, they will start wildly shooting into the air and once again, never stop. It can really be a headache at times and with how often these events pop up in the environment, headaches are ensue.<br /><br />Overall I love the game but I wish they had done just a bit more refining. Still worth 5 starts though	2015-08-17
