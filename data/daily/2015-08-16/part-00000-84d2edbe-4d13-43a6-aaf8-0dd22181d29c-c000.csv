I used to spend extra money to buy shampoos with jojoba oil in them.	I love Jojoba Oil! I use it pretty much all over my body at some point during a weeks' time. I use it on my lips to keep them soft and keep that rough line of rough skin off my lips. With Jojoba oil, my lips are still soft & supple....even as a senior citizen. I rub it on my nails & cuticles (both hands and feet) about once a week. It has helped my nails grow stronger and my cuticles look healthy and pretty. I no longer HAVE to wear polish to make them look &#34;half-way&#34; decent. With this oil, my nails look terrific.  Of course, I use it in my hair. I used to spend extra money to buy shampoos with jojoba oil in them. Now, I don't have to do that. About once a week the night before I'm going to wash my hair, I rub jojoba oil on my scalp and in my hair. I then either put on a night cap or I sleep with a towel on my pillow. I think this makes more of it stay on my hair. The next morning, I wash my hair as usual and my hair is just shiny enough...not too slick and definitely not dry.... just healthy looking.  I have used the JOJOBA OIL from TTA Brands for about 10 days now and love it. I love the size because I can put it in my purse... now, that's a statement in itself! I have used other jojoba oils but I would NEVER put them in my purse because most of them leak. THIS one doesn't. It has some kind of special cap (I guess) that makes the jar leak free. I still put it in a plastic bag just to be sure but I take it along with me. If I'm out someplace and my lips start to get chapped, I just put a small dot on my finger and rub it on my lips. Within minutes, my lips are no longer chapped.  Oh! And, I rub it on my skin...especially my arms. You can see by the photo that it only takes a couple of drops (these are really pretty small drops, too.) With those two little drops, I can massage the jojoba oil from the tips of my fingers up and beyond my elbows. Always the elbows... it keeps that rough skin away from my elbows.  I am totally & completely sold on jojoba oil andthe TTA Brands oil hasn't let me down. I don't see how it could because it is 100% pure, organic cold pressed, unrefined - PREMIUM quality Jojoba Oil. And that's what makes jojoba oil good.  I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review.

About 2 years ago I switched from an electric razor to a traditional razor.  I tried almost every cream and gel available.  Most of them left my skin greasy, dried out or chaffed.  I was ready to switch back to the trusty electric when I found Duke Cannon's shaving cream. It lathers perfectly, provides a smooth glide for the razor, smells great and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed after the shave. I would never go back to electric and I definitely wouldn't use another shaving cream.  Top notch stuff!	2015-08-16

The tools seem to be good quality and sturdy.  Being new to this type of kit, I wish there were instructions for use included but unfortunately there is not but after a bit of online research, I found some easy to follow instruction.  The tools are fairly easy to use and grip but they do take some practice and a bit of care to do.  Just like using your fingers, you can damage your skin and create infections if you are not careful.  These should be disinfected prior to using and each time you want to use to minimize infections.  If it best I have found to practice on areas that are not as noticeable until you get the hang of it as with too much pressure you can really mark you skin and you don’t want to cause issues with your skin especially on your face.  These do work especially for those tough areas to reach but again should be used with care.<br /><br />4 stars<br /><br />I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review.

I added 5 drops of it with my conditioner and I noticed a huge difference right away. My hair was still wet in the shower and I could feel how smooth it was already. I was afraid I was going to have really greasy looking hair. But it is not greasy at all. Now that my hair is dry it is staying manageable even though it is 88 degrees outside with about 70% humidity. That's pretty dang good to me! I will play around with it a bit to see what works. I read you can also add it to your hair after you are out of the shower. You would massage it in then pat dry with a towel. I would consider my hair pretty 'normal'. What ever 'normal' is. It's pretty long and needs a trim desperately but I manage to keep it looking healthy. This argan oil is going to help my hair look it's best. I haven't spoke of how it can also be used on nails and skin. I do have to mention the smell. It's not what I imagined argan oil would smell like. I can't really compare it to any other. If I get that opportunity I will definitely follow back up. I would recommend this item for sure!	2015-08-16

It has two arms on the inside, which both hold the cigarettes and help the case to spring open a bit, too. It does a great job of holding cigarettes, and it looks a little bit more classy than just a pack of cigarettes. The design on this is great. It has different patterns on the front and on the back, and it comes in different designs. I'm reviewing the Diamond L, for 100 size cigarettes. It's a little bit longer, but this also comes in the regular size, too. It's a little bit easy to pinch your fingers on this, but after a while I got used to it.<br /><br />It's made out of a thin stainless steel, so it's lightweight and looks great. I recommend it.<br /><br />*NeverXhale gave me this case to review*	2015-08-16

I was recommended this line by my aesthetician and I have never heard of Jan Marini.  I am 45 years old, and for the past 10 years I used Philosophy line for skin care.  But when that company sold to Coty, I noticed the products were not as good.  I struggled to find something that was not going to break the bank, something effective.  Finally, this is it!  My skin has always been oily and prone to break out, well at 40 years old my skin changed and I was very balanced but didn't understand that I was not dry, my skin was dehydrated.  Jan Marini in the last s 6 months changed that! I am fan! And yes, some of the products in the Management System you will use faster than others, i.e. The face wash lasts me 3 months and the rest of the products will last about 2 1/2 months.  You don't need a lot of product on your skin, this stuff is concentrated and absorbs well.  Remember, less is more!!  Both times I have ordered the Management System and I have received a fresh package with an expiration date for 2016.  No breakouts, no irritation.  The Skin Care Management is a great buy all in one.	2015-08-16

Lost fuzzy frizz gained curls	I perm my hair to get light spiral curls. My hair is normally straight, fine and thin, and the sides are white-grey while the back is healthy and has a little grey in it. The back keeps its curl definition but the sides tend to frizz up after the perm because of being grey. If I air dry my hair, the sides look good until I either pick it or a little time passes.  It won't take long before it gets fuzzy rather than curly.<br /><br />I've tried everything to keep the fuzzy frizz under control from oils to heavy conditioners. All that did was give me oily frizz!  I saw this product the other day so gave it a try. It isn't expensive so was worth a shot. All I can say is &#34;WOW&#34; because the sides now have the same curl definition as the back. Even if I pick it out a bit, it keeps the curl and looks healthy and shiny. I dampened the sides (not much) and rubbed about a nickel size blob on my hands then on the sides (in other words, my hair wasn't wet). I had enough left over that I ran it through the back, too. My hair looks amazing - all curl, no frizz. And the curls are not &#34;crunchy&#34; After my hair dries I lightly run my fingers through my curls go fluff them out and I'm good to go.  I love this stuff! So much I came here and ordered 4 more to keep on hand. I never want to run out!	2015-08-16

My son has been growing his hair out for a couple months now and he has been asking for me to do something with it. So when I came across this product I was excited and what made it even better was that I was given the opportunity to receive the Cherir Premium Hair Sponge for free in exchange for my review and honest opinion. So here it goes.....   When I first received it I was excited and opened it up right away and decided to give it a try on my son's (dry) hair just to see what if anything would happen and as I already expected nothing really happened so we waited until after shower time and decided to give it another try. Well... After the shower and the normal routine of washing and applying product we sat down and gave the sponge another try well I tried my hardest to get it to show me some kind of result at the rate I was going something would have been better than nothing! I was starting to get frustrated because I read review after review and watched a few videos so I had to be doing something wrong. So I kept trying and just when I started to see little twists forming and continue ahead with the process I somehow made it worse and undid what I started. At this point I needed a break and yes this might give some of you reading this a laugh I called in my 15 year old daughter and asked her to give it a try because she had watched a few of the videos with me. Well she got right to it and within a few mins we started to see it work. It had made very nice, cute, evenly spaced twists. I would say to anyone ready to give up when they don't see immediate results to take a step back breathe and then try again because as skeptical as I was this product really does work and does exactly when it claims to do. I would definitely recommend this to others.   *I received this product for free in exchange for my review and honest opinion*	2015-08-16

With a couple of curly-girls in the house, I'm always on the lookout for products to help tame their wild manes. I definitely prefer encouraging the spirals instead of the current trend of straightening it to within an inch of its life. This curl reviving potion is a new favorite product. The formula smells so good and is super thick and creamy right out of the bottle. A little bit goes a long way. It not only helps curls, it does a great job of pain-free detangling. I found it left hair ultra smooth and touchably soft while helping to define and differentiate each curl. Plus we love that it isn't tested on animals. We will be keeping this on hand for curl rescue as the new school year begins!<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.	2015-08-16

I have very dry curly Afro American hair and I can dry my hair with this towel with only a few swipes through my hair. It absorbs the water easily without completely drying it out and making it brittle. This towel was sent to me to test as I have other products from this vendor and I'm so glad that I chose to give it a try and a review. I've waited a few weeks before writing my review as I wanted to use it for a bit to give it a valid test of use and washing afterwards. It wasn't clear to me what the difference could possibly be with a towel but this is proof that there are more absorbent materials that can be utilized. I really like it and I swim 4 to 5 times a week, this is the towel I use on my hair after washing my hair in the shower. Give it a try!	2015-08-16

I've always been very hesitant when it comes to putting products on my skin, so I've always used nailpolishes remover and washed my hands thoroughly instead.<br />This product I've come to love in just a matter of minutes. I've had it for weeks now, I bought it from the original website.<br />If you're looking for something that will blow you away and make nailart 10x faster, this is definitely the product for you. I made a collage and totally overdid my finger, so you can get an idea of how great this product is.<br />The best part; it came off in one piece.<br />The only downfall is that yes, the brush might get chunky. If it ever happens to you, you can super easily take a qtip and remove it. It'll look completely new.<br />Always remember to close it real tight.<br />Something else I really like about this particular product is that the brush is just like a nailpolish brush. It makes it really easy to get all around.<br />I know it took the developer multiple months, she tried it on herself and she tested out 6 different liquid latex products and she sent this to 35 nail artists before she started selling it, to make sure they all liked it.<br />This was not done by someone that just wanted to get a brand out like big companies. There was a lot of thought put into this.<br />If you're still questioning wether or not to buy this, I suggest checking out her website; nailcarehq.com	2015-08-16

I have light skin with some soft rosy color on my cheeks and nose areas. Combo skin, and this stuff works nice for me. It's a very light coverage so I get a small coverage while still looking natural. It gives me a bit of a glow too but not too shiny for me. I was using the Badger sunscreen that left a white film on my face. I also used the Alba CC+ but it had rapeseed oil in it which is Not good for you and it was too obvious I was wearing foundation, so I liked this change with the Andalou Naturals CC spf 30. I'm glad I tried it! Yes it will give you a bit of a glow or some will say shine but if your skin is combo or dry it should be fine. This is a good product for someone looking for a natural look with a tiny enhancement.	2015-08-16

I already have the Eczema Therapy Shampoo so I figured the conditioner was a must have also. I have been using the combo for the last week and absolutely love the Manuka Honey because it makes my hait super soft. I also don't have an itchy scalp or any flakes and that's just one week. I plan on using this for the next couple weeks and then maybe just once a week for maintenance or whenever I have a flare-up. I definitely recommend this Eczema Therapy Conditioner Treatment from pH at 5.5 for anyone who has an itchy or flaky scalp. And you should probably just get the shampoo to go with it, the combo is great.	2015-08-16

[[VIDEOID:96d1f86a40530ecbdadfae3b92ccf4b9]] ★ i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not influenced by anyone in any way.<br /><br />🌟 UPDATED: 6/26/2016 - I got this diffuser August 2015. Almost a year ago. I keep it in my front 2nd bathroom and I use it on a daily basis. I fill it with a favorite essential oil and turn it on. Sometime twice a day, but usually just once. But it has been really great so far. Absolutely love it still. Just wanted to update on how it's going.<br />--------------<br />I have several diffusers now and they seem to just get better. I think so far this one is my favorite. I like the way it's designed and the way it feels. I know that might sound funny, but it just feels nice. This ZAQ Allay Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser lets out a lot of nice mist but no condensation, which is really good. I don't like those that by the time you have left it on for an hour, you area of where the diffuser is like a pool of water.<br />I put this one in my living room and add a few drops o my lavender essential oil and it actually fills the enter room of nice aroma, which I was surprised. In my video I said &#34;small&#34; room but after leaving it on all day today, it was nice to have an aroma throughout the house just from one difusser.<br /><br />✔️ OVERALL: This diffuser would make a great wedding shower gift. It comes gift ready and I feel that this diffuser is a really good buy.<br />---------<br />I will always be honest in my reviews. I know that being a consumer myself, I want to see honest reviews, not a 4-5 star just to make a seller happy. My husband and I rely on reviews for our buying decisions as well.	2015-08-16

This is good, but there is literally no good grip for your hands - the sides are slickly coated and you can't really hold it, and holding the rough edges just hurts your hands!

Getting a good quality moisturizer for a good price can be challenging, so when I find one I love, I am pretty excited.  I received this BioPeptide moisturizer in exchange for my honest opinion.  First off, I really feel this is a good value - 4 oz for under $20 (check prices, they change regularly on Amazon!) is a sweet price - I swear, I usually get teeny tiny bottles for huge amounts of money or I get a big bottle and it is full of crazy chemicals.  This moisturizer is made with wonderful and natural ingredients that your skin will love - mine certainly has!  I've been using it for about a month and notice my skin looks and feels so much better.  I am able to use this in the morning after my shower and before I put on my makeup.  It applies smoothly and evenly without leaving an oily residue and my skin feels super soft and supple.  I really like the gentle scent that is a bit sweet without interfering of any other scents and seems to be strictly ingredient related, not an artificial addition.	2015-08-16

It may not be a huge impact, but you can notice the difference. It's hard to notice it within a day, so you have to be patient. In order for this product to work, you must use it twice a day everyday, just like what you should already do as your normal brushing routine. It literally only takes 2 minutes, 1 per step (there's 2 steps total) and is really quick and easy. As the days went on, I gradually saw my teeth slightly become whiter and whiter. After about a month, I noticed that the biggest thing the 2-step cleaning product did was get rid of the yellow plaque buildup in between and around my teeth! They are the hard to get to regions of your teeth! It's so convenient when you haven't been to the dentist in a while. The taste of the product is minty and can be gritty, but it does leave your mouth fresh and clean, not like other toothpastes I've been using. One day, I had an instance where I didn't have access to my cleaning system and had to use a different toothpaste, and oh my, it felt so different. It wasn't the same because my mouth didn't feel clean enough like the system does for you. I can't imagine living without this product. I'm so glad I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest®. All opinions stated in this review are my own!	2015-08-16

So i wanted to write this review to say This stuff works great!!!!  I have tried alot of others from 2010 to2014 which kept what i have up till when i saw lipogaine which had alot of great reviews so i figured i give it a try and the first month i notice spiky small hairs coming threw, Than in the 3rd month they was coming out all over my head.  Im on around my 7th bottle and i uploaded 2 pics from December 1st till now.  one bottle was lasting me like 40days at the start cause i had less hair. But sense i have more hair now it lasts me around 30days.  Pretty much lets just say nothing comes close to lipogaine. And for any new people wanting to try it you have to give it time and not quit after the first or 2nd month You have to stay with it for at least 6months.  Pretty much lets just say nothing comes close to lipogaine.  And for any new people wanting to try it you have to give it time and not quit after the first or 2nd month You have to stay with it for at least 6months and don't be scared seeing shedding because i had it the first months you will see it and when that happens it means its working because its getting rid of the dead hair to make room for the new.  But this stuff is worth it to give it a try.  It working for me as you can see by my 2 photos:) still have more to go tho but i know its working:)  Some will see faster results than others i say im around the middle? But so far i been very happy with the product:)  Great stuff!!!	2015-08-16

It had to live up to a tall standard as I was using the previous top model of Braun. While it has slimmed down in design, it is far more comfortable to hold, and works really well on my face with a full beard. It is gentle to not snag beard hair that I want to retain, but gives a close smooth shave each time.<br />A couple of design features, one minor, the other more important. The trimmer in the rear of the device is smaller than previous models, so it takes longer to use on a full face. Works well, but more time consuming, minor detail. More importantly  the charging and cleaning station is much lower material craftsmanship than previous models. It literally broke when I attempted to connect the charging cord to the station! I had to disassemble the station and reconnect everything. Perhaps just a one off issue, but not fun when you receive a new toy and want to use it. One the plus side, much prettier and MUCH quieter than previous models.<br />Please note that I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.	2015-08-16

I got the Fire scent and it has a very spicy, earthlike and woodsy scent that was unlike any other lotion I've tried before. It also feels very good on you're skin and the bottle looks pretty cool too. I'm definitely interested in trying some of the other Kyoku lotion scents in the future.	2015-08-16

This product didnt seem to hydrate my hair. I did the Lco and Loc method. It has a loy of wonderful stuff in it. I intend to add some extra evoo to it and also i am overdue for a protein treatment so maybe this help with the dryness i am currently feeling. I purchased this from Sallys 18oz for under $4.

This review is based on the Braun Series 9 9090cc Electric Shaver that I was chosen to test, and that I received completely FREE from Braun.<br />I haven't used an electric shaver in 10 years, so I was a little hesitant to test the Braun Series 9 9090cc at first. My old electric shaver would literally pull longer hairs instead of gently cut.<br />I had no need to worry, Braun has produced an incredible product in the Series 9.<br />Out of the Box: The Shaver is beautifully designed, perfectly Slim, Solid Build and Weight but not overly heavy, great to hold, you can feel the quality that's gone into producing the Shaver.<br />During the first charge The Shaver was at Full Charge within an hour as stated.<br />After switching on the shaver a gentle Buzzing sound began, with a delicate vibration, unlike the noisy Shavers of times gone by.<br />I had 4 days worth of growth on my face so this was definitely a Big test for the Series 9, but I had nothing to worry about, the 4 specialized cutters glided through the long hair and stubble like a knife through butter, quiet a lot of my face was clean in one pass.<br />I probably spent a good 7 minutes or so shaving, which to me is an incredibly fast shave considering the 4 days of hair and stubble I had on my face. The Series 9 glided effortlessly over the contours of my face, the Shaver did all the hard work, all I did was hold and guide it.<br />I have sideburns, I couldn't get a tight shave right up to the bottom of my side burns but the Long Hair Trimmer made light work of that and a nice tight cut was produced. I did have a couple of ingrowing hairs left over, but I don't know of any Shaver that can deal with those, that's so minor it's hardly worth mentioning really.<br />In past experience I always found under my nose a tricky place to Shave, but with the locking mechanism on the pivoting head it was very easy to shave in that area, one pass and it was clear of stubble.<br />Not once during the shave did I feel any discomfort, chafing or irritation from the cutters or foil, it really was a surprising and wonderful shaving experience. After shaving there was no redness or sore areas on my face at all.<br />I checked to see how closely the Specialized Cutting Elements cut the hair, I was surprised to see that it was just as close a cut as I get when I use my disposable razor, I was very impressed.<br />Cleaning the Series 9 was a breeze and also very fast, after following the instructions closely I used the small brush to remove stubble, hair and dust from the pivoting head and gently tapped the Foil and Cutter Cassette to remove excess stubble, very simple, very fast.<br />A small single droplet icon appeared on the shavers display informing me to use the Clean & Charge Station. The Station isn't of the same quality as the Shaver itself, but no need to worry, it does exactly what it says on the box, very well.<br />It's very simple to install the shaver, it fits like a glove in the station, you press one button and the Station goes into automatic Clean mode.<br />After 2-3 minutes the Cleaning cycle ends and then the Drying fan starts, the Series 9 was Clean, Dry and fully charged again with in an hour, very impressive.<br />Over time you do have to replace the cleaning fluid cartridge, Braun recommend every 8 weeks, but if you thoroughly clean the Shaver with the brush and get out as much hair and dust as possible manually, I think you can make the Cleaning Fluid last a little longer, especially if like me you don't shave daily.<br />On top of everything else provided in the box one extra element that impressed me was the carry case for the Shaver, lightweight but incredibly sturdy and strong.<br />As far as Pro's go, the whole product impressed me, the Look, Feel, Weight, Quality, Shave and Cleaning process of the Series 9 went beyond my expectations.<br />If there is one slight Con, it would be the Price, at around $400 it might put a few people off, but that really is minor, you're paying for a very high quality product.<br />I'm Impressed, and look forward to my next shave.	2015-08-16

I first bought this product after receiving a demo at my local HMart, where the cosmetics counter girl showed me how to apply and use it. I have been a BB cream user for many years. Prior to finding this, my favorite was Dr. Jart and Etude House. The two things I love most about this product are the air cushion application system and the small amount of product you have to use. The air cushion and sponge means that my hands stay clean, and it only takes me three little bounces on the cushion to get enough products for my whole face. one for each cheek, and one for my t-zone. I have normal skin with mild rosacea, and this covers beautifully and is very natural looking. Some BB creams can look a little pasty, even on my fair skin, but this one is extremely natural looking. I wear C21. I'm not sure what the deal is with the color system, but I know that once I bought the N21 thinking it would be neutral toned instead of cool toned, but it was way WAY too white and ghostly looking on me. For reference, I wear makeup forever HD foundation in 215.	2015-08-16

Beauty	5	2	2	N	N	The results are nothing short of amazing	This product couldn't have arrived at a better time since we were headed to the beach for our annual vacation and my best friend had already been talking about getting a new piercing.  Now, for the most part I can take a lot of pain but when it comes to piercings and tattoos I'd rather take whatever steps I can to alleviate unnecessary suffering, especially when our vacation is at stake.  She followed the directions and washed the aread thoroughly then applied the Lidocaine as instructed.  The instructions suggest covering the lidocaine with saran wrap but she was getting her ear pierced in 2 places - the helix and tragus so that was simply not a possibility but didn't seem to make a big difference because the area was completely numb after about 45 minutes so we headed to the boardwalk to do the deed.  We arrived at the piercing place about an hour and a half after the application and she said she never felt a thing during either piercing and even ended up repeating the procedure the next day to get her rook and anti-tragus pierced, all pain free.  We're planning on getting tattoos in a few weeks and will be using Lidocaine once again, I would definitely recommend this product.  On a side note, my future daughter in law gets sun burned very easily and for the most part aloe works but she had gotten really badly burned on her shoulders so I applied the lidocaine and instant relief.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product	2015-08-16

I waited 3 weeks to write a review and after swimming in the ocean and pool to make sure it's the bomb. Bam ! It is. My preteen was tired of the kiddy hairstyles I was doing to her 100% natural hair. I was totally against a relaxer/perm and didn't like the formaldehyde horror stories I'd heard about Keratin treatment.<br /><br />So I did my research and found Japanese thermal reconditioning treatment and thought it was a happy medium. Not as harsh as a relaxer/perm but not as week and more long lasting than keratin treatment.  My daughter does not like to do her hair. Let me rephrase-she hates doing her hair. She will walk out the house looking like buckwheat if I let her (she walked to the park like that)!<br /><br />Now let me say there must be strong chemicals in it cause it stinks! Definitely have windows n doors open! I took my time followed directions to the &#34;T&#34; and 4 hours later voilà!!! She loves it and now actually does her own hair. I'm happy she's happy and my 3 other daughters are happy! I've heard that some say u should not do this on African American hair but it can definitely be done I bought the normal and left it on for 30 minutes and only left the neutralizer on for 5! So please don't listen to others who say it's not for our hair. This product is for All people regardless of race or hair type. Just choose the right one and you will look as beautiful as my baby!	2015-08-16

This is a brilliant shampoo for treated red hair. I was recommended this shampoo by my stylist/colorist, after he did an amazing job of putting reds and purples in my hair, and by using this with the matching conditioner--alternated with a combination of Aveda products (Color Conserve Shampoo and Madder Root Conditioner--I've been able to maintain my color really well without my grey popping up nearly so fast. It's also summertime, when the sun has the best chance of messing up my color, and yet the Pureology Reviving Red shampoo & conditioner are working like a charm! The size is perfect for traveling (TSA-friendly!) and it's easily refillable because the travel size-bottle is just a straight pour one. Having this and the matching conditioner gives me the confidence to travel without worrying that the hotel shampoo will mess up my expensive color job!	2015-08-16

However that's not necessarily a bad thing, I have other brushes that are actually too dense so it's nice to have a variety.  But from the size/picture I thought it would be bigger/fluffier.  It makes applying blush feel very light and easy, but I do find myself dipping into the blush compact more.  For the price I think it's a good brush to have.  Definitely better for a lighter/natural look and with blush vs bronzer.	2015-08-16

I think this Tamanu Oil smells like figs.  It really did give off that Fresh wild Fig aroma to me, which is good. I like it.  I put a few drops in my Aromatherapy diffuser to see if the smell in the vapor would help with the burnt garlic bread scent that was lingering in my apartment from earlier, and It really did help me with that.  I like how thick Majestic Pure Extra Tamanu Oil is.  I am building up my Oil Collection and this one is just nice to have.  I like that it helped change the atmosphere in my house.

I've been using this razor for nearly a year now.  Not only does it produce a far smoother shave, it is much less abusive to my skin than the Gillette Mach 3 it replaced.  In addition, the blades are far and away cheaper that the Gillette cartridges.  I change them once a week.  Two tips that have served me well: hold the razor at a near-perpendicular angle, 70 to 80 degrees.  Also, use cold water for preparation and rinsing.  Get rid of that cheap cartridge razor with its expensive blades.  This razor will last you a lifetime.	2015-08-16

I have used a lot of shampoo's for color treated hair in my life. From top shelf name brand products that cost a fortune to my own organic home made goods, let me tell you, this Sulfate-Free shampoo is pretty great! My hair is not oily but stays moisturized, I don't have to heat dry or style it for it to look nice, and it provides a nice bounce/weightlessness too it. I highly recommend. I would also try the moisture version as both are miraculous in my opinion.	2015-08-16

For bargain brand makeup, this is a great buy. It isn't cakey and goes on smoothly. I only give it three stars, because I can feel it when it's on, and it's a little difficult to blend each time I use it for the right/consistent color. I'm no makeup pro, so it takes me awhile to really get my desired look, which is to look like I have no makeup on. Anyway, in more experienced hands, I'm sure they would have better results. Still, a great price for a decent product.	2015-08-16

So I started doing research on more natural approaches to control my problem and skin care in general, and I found the benefits of tamanu oil. Why not try? As nothing else was working in anyway. So I started using this oil for cleansing my face mixed with raw honey. Well it did much to improve my oily skin. My skin is no longer irritated and it seems to be helping with its overall tone which is kinda cool. It also doesn't seem to be making my problem any worse, which is also awesome.	2015-08-16

This is an adorable little traveling makeup bag. I love the size and it's so cute and tote-able. There are two zippered sections that I find very roomy for such a small bag. There are zippers on each side so that you can zip it open and closed in which ever direction you find comfortable. The top layer has 5 pouches to tuck away make up brushes or tubed make up. There is also a small tethered mirror that is a nice handy inclusion. The bottom pouch is a nice spacious section that is easy to toss in what ever you choose. The sewing on the pouch is well done and I see no open or frayed seams, the material is a nice wipe-able surface that is easy to clean with a wet cloth. In looking over the other reviews I noted that they noticed a bad smell, I was concerned with this as I have allergies and am VERY sensitive to scents like this. I was very happy that mine had no odor or scent to it at all, so whatever issue there was with this I'm glad they've taken care of it. The pattern on the bag is bright and fun, the handle is securely attached and a nice size making it easy to carry. I'm very pleased with this traveling makeup bag! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-16

Best Cellulite Transdermal Cream With Intense Thermogenic Action  FOR REVIEW<br /><br />For starters the cream smell a little like menthol to me is not a real big deal you just smell like you have sports cream on. the cream does have a warming effect after you put the belt on. I haven't noticed any changes yet but it is still early and i would like to give this product a fair chance. but as of now I see no problems with it, plus it can be used for massaging , give it a try	2015-08-16

We'll see.<br /><br />As for how it was while it worked, I liked it. I never really used the lights, I preferred to leave them off, so I just went with the diffuser. It was a little louder than my other ultrasonic, but it got the job done. The only annoying thing was the top, it's 3 pieces. So instead of picking up the lid and pouring more water in you have to remove 3 separate pieces and replace them all each time.	2015-08-16

I am slowly but surely building up my Bella & Bear collection.  I'm the proud owner of the makeup bag and now I have the makeup brush holder.  I love this brand and the collection is very cute and stylish.  As always Bella & Bear pay attention to details big and small.  This makeup brush holder certainly does not disappoint.<br /><br />The make up brush holder comes in a very cute box that has the same classic Bella & Bear floral print as the holder itself.  This holder can fit quite a few brushes.  As a makeup junkie I have lots of brushes but only a few are worthy to sit upon the throne of Bella & Bear.  I picked out a cute 10 piece brush set I have and tried it out inside the brush holder.  As you can see from the pictures the brushes match the holder perfectly, but that's not what this review is about.  Even with 10 brushes in the holder there is still more room for another 10 brushes, maybe more. The holder is tall enough to fit full-size brushes and even has a top so that you can take it with you on-the-go.  I love that on the sides of the holder there are snaps to make sure your brushes are safe and secure inside.  This brush holder will sit on my vanity in style with the top off for all the world (or whoever comes into my room) to see the awesomeness that is Bella & Bear, and how cute it matches my brushes.  When I need to hit the road, whether it be a vacation or a overnight stay with my boyfriend all I need to do is attach the top, secure the snaps and throw in my overnight bag along with matching Bella & Bear makeup bag. This brand makes high quality products that will be adored by me for years to come.<br /><br />I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.ct in exchange for my honest review but opinions are all my own.	2015-08-16

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Helped my toothache	If you love the smell of basil, just opening the bottle will make you close your eyes in bliss. It did for me! This is very fresh smelling and is genuine/undiluted basil oil. I read that it's good at reducing itching from insect bites, so I rubbed some on a particularly annoying bite on my ankle and it does seem to have helped. People also use it in cooking, for cold symptoms, to help relieve stress and depression, to enhance mental clarity, for motion sickness, and more. While I was reading about this oil I noted that people have used it for pain relief; and the next day I got a toothache. I've long used rosemary oil and clove oil applied to the gums to help toothaches, but they take a while to work. I tried a smidge of basil (straight - you are not supposed to use it undiluted, but I did) and it provided very fast pain relief. I would still use rosemary and clove as they help fight the inflammation and infection causing the pain, but the basil is a great way to knock out the pain.<br /><br />As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

Because it made skin cells turn over it also helped repair and prevent wrinkles, age spots, acne scars, minimized pores, and provided a brighter and more even complexion. Sounds like a gold mine of a beauty product, right? I went for it and added retinol to my daily skin care routine and it was all true. My skin always looks its best when I use retinol at night. However, a good quality retinol treatment is a bit expensive, so I was happy to find HealthyWiser Advanced Retinol Serum, which is an affordable, comprehensive retinol product. I received it complimentary in return for my honest opinion.<br /><br />Made in the USA with natural and organic ingredients, the unique formula of HealthyWiser Advanced Retinol Serum includes Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea, and Vitamin E (which is helpful to soothe and protect fragile skin when using a retinol treatment). While I've only ever used a retinol cream, this product is a serum, with a texture almost gel-like, and it smooths on so well. It comes in a dark amber glass bottle which helps protect the integrity and longevity of the product, and it uses a dropper for application. I haven't been able to get the dropper to work very well with the consistency of the serum, so I usually just use it as a dipper.<br /><br />I've got to say, I've been really happy with this retinol serum. My skin is always brighter and I feel like it does all it promises to do! My tip for using this product is to apply at night and be sure to use a lightweight sunscreen during the day. Like I mentioned above, retinol turns skin cells over and so your skin will be much more prone to sun burns and damage!	2015-08-16

Beauty	5	3	3	N	N	Fresh, Clean, Home	This little bottle of pine oil certainly packs a punch.  The pine oil is made my Plant Therapy and I really like it.  It comes in a small bottle and has 1 oz. of product.  The smell is so strong you only need a few drops so a little bit can go a long way.  I purchased this pine oil because I love to use it for cleaning.  I use the pine to make my own household cleaner, (you know the kind, it has pine in the name), I also use it to make toilet bombs, and wash the walls.  After a afternoon of cleaning the whole house smells nice and fresh. Also with the holiday season upon us soon this oil will definitely be very useful.<br /><br />Pine oil also has health benefits.  You can add a few drops to a bath, oil diffuser, face steamer or even a cotton ball and smell periodically throughout the day to help with asthma, coughing, and bronchitis.  You can also add the pine oil to a carrier oil for pain relief from arthritis and sore muscles.  I love that pine oil scent and it's great because it has a multitude of uses.  I think it is a household staple.<br /><br />I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

A previous reviewer said it was about 80% resemblance....I would say it's more like 10%.  I suspect this is made with essential oils as it has a slightly oily feel on the skin. I would describe it as more of a patchouli scent.  It lasts for a very long time so if you like it you can wear it all day, however the scent is very strong and should be used in moderation.  I put a few rolls on and found myself washing it off later as it was pretty overpowering.  I find the bottle and applicator to be really cool.  I wish all colognes came in a bottle like this as it gives you greater control when applying.  However, I ultimately was disappointed in the scent.  If you are looking for Silver Mountain Water you are probably off with the real stuff.  If you are ok with the fact that this really slightly resembles Silver Mountain Water than I think you might be happy with it.  I think you really just need a small dab of the stuff and its somewhat pleasant.  Truth be told my wife likes it so I'll probably keep wearing it.  The fact that you can only put on a little bit means this small vial will likely last a long time.	2015-08-16

As others have mentioned the wood tends to fall of the brush, which for the price is a very quick fix (a little hot glue!) This does NOT undermine the quality of the brushes.

This brush set is excellent for all of my powder and cream needs and it will work for all of your needs too!

I started having a bad breakout this summer when I stopped taking the medication by dermatologist recommended (I was kinda scared of the side effects,that's why). So I did some research online and found something that's missing on my skin care regimen- cleansing oil. I found this cleansing oil from watching YouTube  and quickly ordered one from amazon. I could say that it's one of the best skin care products I have tried. My breakouts did not only disappear from one week of using it, but it has pretty much calmed down my sensitive skin. It does an excellent job in removing make up (I also use it for eye make up) and leaves my face feeling clean (but not dry) before I even use my facial cleanser. I have suffered from sunburn in my face from failure to use sunblock in the past, but this cleansing oil has some brightening effects that made my skin tone more even.<br /><br />The only downside I could think of is that it stings my eyes a little bit. But I have very sensitive eyes to begin with so I'm not sure if this happens to other users. The pros are much more helpful though.<br /><br />This is the first item from The Face Shop skin care line that I have ever used. But since I'm very impressed with this cleansing oil, I ordered their facial foam wash today at amazon. Hoping to get amazing results from this as well!	2015-08-16

It has a nice soft scent that even when male family members stay they comment on how much they like it. Is a delicate scent, so don't think it'll smell like zest or lever 2000.  It has  a great lather and the glycerin provided better moisturizing then other soaps.... Hence why I like to use to shave with.  This is also a more natural type soap too.  I hope this soap is always available.  It can be hard to find at times, but occasionally I locate it at Target.  I love this deal as it gives me enough for the year.	2015-08-16

I bought three of these.....one for my dogs, one for me, one for my Superman who is an Engineer for a major railroad and is on the road, or tracks, a lot. He keeps a close beard and a neat haircut and this is perfect for him to take with him on the road to keep himself looking fly so when he comes home to me, he doesn't look like a shaggy bum! It's not meant to give full haircuts or shaves to those with heavy or thick beards so if you're trying to use it for that, you're just asking for pain and trouble, lol! And ladies, don't use it on your bikini line, or try to shave your legs with it either! You need to just break down and buy high quality razors and take the time to do it properly! I used it on my Bubba Dog just this morning because he can't stand the hair under his snout to grow over his lips....goes nuts trying to lick it off! Fortunately, he's a very patient dog and loves to be groomed so we had no problems with it.

I really love Orly Bonder when I am trying to apply my Jamberry Nail wraps. I am one of those people that has a difficult time getting my wraps to stick to mu nails (I am told its bc I have more oil in my nails?). I was really frustrated and ready to give up on Jamberry until I came across this product. I clean my nails with an alcohol wipe then apply the Bonder and let it dry. It dries fairly quickly and works like a charm. It really lives up to its name as a bonder. And no, if you don't apply anything over top of it, the Bonder itself is not sticky. It dries smooth and soft, but something about its properties when heated with the nail wrap, really make the bond seal. I really love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for some help keeping nail polish, nail gel, or vinyl wraps on your nails for longer periods of time.	2015-08-16

It lightened my regrowth to a very light blonde and took a good deal of pink out of my hair. I followed it up with wella lightest ash blonde toner and it worked like a charm.	2015-08-16

Wanted to find something natural to use for a deodorant.  This does a decent job with odor protection.  Otherwise to the negative parts. No matter how little I use, I am immediately left with chunks of wax balls under my arms and need to wipe off the excess with a tissue. Even one short swipe I will be left with them. So that's gross. Also lately I've started developing some clogged painful pores in my underarms.  Not completely sure if it's due to the deodorant but I do plan on discontinuing tomorrow to see if it gets better. That's the only thing that is applied there so I have to think that's what's causing it. Also i am noticing stains on my shirts. Not impressed.	2015-08-16

Severe burn and even blisters only a couple minutes after application.	I bought the whole Regenerist system not that long ago but immediately returned it. I have extremely sensitive skin to the point where the majority of products do not work for me in drug stores but I was recommended to try it. Unfortunately the Regenerist system immediately started burning horribly upon application and despite being on for only a couple minutes for me to reach water and wash it off I was left with intensely burned skin (think horrible sunburn after falling asleep in the sun) and even a few blisters in extra sensitive areas around my nose and cheekbones (thank god I didn't put any of it around my eyes since I didn't trust a new product yet). I have extremely sensitive combination 20-something year old skin and I have NEVER had such a severe reaction to anything like this set of skin care products. Aloe was the only thing that could soothe this burn that lasted a couple days. I wish I had taken photos to strengthen my warning to sensitives!	2015-08-16

I'm an old lady that has had breakouts since puberty and right now, this is the magic product! As soon as I find something that works it changes or is discontinued. I'm hoping this stays around. I bought it on a whim at a local health food store. Should have bought it there again, but I was lazy and didn't want to drive out there so I did mail order. Bad idea as it was very poorly packaged for mailing and there by arrived damaged. The cleansing bar still keeps the acne at bay and grandma is happy about that.	2015-08-16

Eliminate Lines, Wrinkles, Aging Skin and Crows Feet. No Fillers or Additives. 100% Satisfaction Guarantee! (Original Organic, 1 Oz)	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	I like the packaging of the product	Today I am reviewing a new Defy Naturals Vitamin C Serum 20% Hyaluronic Acid Amino Complex. This is probably at least the fifth product with hyaluronic acid that I have come across. The products that contain hyaluronic acid are some of the most popular products right now due to the main ingredient – hyaluronic acid – making remarkable effects on the skin. There is a lot of general buzz in the beauty care industry about serums containing hyaluronic acid, and I was so excited to try this one.<br /><br />In this particular complex there is also Vitamin C serum addition that complements the hyaluronic acid, and assists in slowing the aging process of skin, and repairing skin damage.<br /><br />I have been using this complex for a few weeks now, and I usually apply it on a cleansed face morning and night, and then apply a moisturizer and sunblock.<br /><br />I have to say that after a few weeks of use of this serum I do see improvement in my skin tone and overall skin appearance.<br /><br />I like the packaging of the product, I find it looks more like a pharmaceutical to me, so adds more credibility to the brand in my opinion. The colors of the packaging are all various tones of green. This product is not organic, but it has not been tested on animals, it is made in the USA, and it is vegan. The packaging looks very similar to many other hyaluronic serums I have seen. It is very much in line with other similar products, and so I wish it looked a little more sleek maybe. I would buy this for myself, but I am not sure if I were to use it as a gift, as it does not look fancy enough for a gift in my opinion.<br /><br />The container with the serum has a convenient pipette for easier application. The serum does not have any scent. The serum is very mild on my skin, and I haven’t noticed any irritations. The serum has very liquidy texture, it seems that I am applying oil or water on my face, but it does not leave any shine, or residue, and is absorbed in the skin very well.<br /><br />I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars! This is a nice product with hyaluronic acid, and it is very affordable!<br /><br />I have received this product for free in order to review it.	2015-08-16

I'm never deterred by generics so I wasn't deterred by these when I needed more brush heads. Unfortunately these are NOT like the &#34;real thing&#34;, the bristles feel very weird and that's understandable for the price, but even with the price point, if I were to keep buying these, I would spend more money than buying the original brush heads.<br /><br />I had to replace the first head after about 4 days because it stopped moving from side to side, it was stuck in one position which did nothing for cleaning my teeth, the second head lasted 2 days, same problem. Everyone knows that you need to take off the brush head and rinse it off after a brush because toothpaste does get inside it, it's even in the instructions of the tooth brush itself that you should take off the brush head and rinse it off. These are not built to be taken off and on the brush, like the originals are, because by the time I got to the third brush head I decided I'd stop rinsing the brush head by taking it off the toothbrush, this has worked and the third brush head has been going for around a week. Nevertheless, this seems kind of gross because I don't want there to be stale, dried up toothpaste inside the brush head.<br /><br />I've ordered the brand name brush heads and should be getting them soon, I think I will have the remaining brush head from this pack as an emergency replacement. I'm glad I bought the 4-pack first rather than the bigger pack because I'm sad to say that these were kind of a waste of money. Good thing they're not expensive.	2015-08-16

I think the content leaked out during shipment. I was frustrated because I was going to take it on my trip and the shipment itself took a few days to arrive in the first place. However after I contacted the seller, the seller sent the replacement overnight immediately and gave me a refund. If that's not great customer service I don't know what is! As for the product I am very happy with also. The spray is like a light mist, and does a great job holding the style but without making it look unnatural or stiff. I also like the fact that you can restyle your hair during the day by combing or using your fingertips. Yes, it's more pricey than your regular hairspray, but this isn't your regular hairspray and well worth it! The sprayhead is pretty nice too as you can lock it so it doesn't spray out if you were to stick it in your bag:)<br /><br />***UPDATE 9/18/2015 :  I initially gave it 5 stars but I had to change it to 3 stars for two reasons...<br />1) Soon after, the spay started clogging up. It instructs to run under warm water when it did, and it worked a couple of times. But at this point, the only way I could get it to spray is to poke a hole each time with a pin.<br />2) Although the spray handle is unique and sleek looking, it feels awkward and hard to aim right. The work around for this is just like someone else posted, to press on the top part of the handle instead of squeezing the actual handle.<br /><br />That being said, I still do like what this does and how the scent isn't overwhelming at all.	2015-08-16

I am tired of spending so much money for mediocre products and decided to get serious about shaving the traditional, correct with a top quality tools.. I had ordered a new razor but the company I ordered it from claimed they had sold out of the one I ordered five days later.. The strop I ordered made it to me in 2 days and is a functional work of art that I am sure will be a joy to put to use as soon as the second razor I've ordered arrives.. When you consider the money you are no longer shelling out for razor blades that have become obsolete and require you to purchase a new handle for newer designed blades (or vise verse) all of the time and the effect on the environment of throwing the plastic crap in the trash, a straight razor, strop and very comfortable shave is very desireable..	2015-08-16

I don't get too much acne, but I do have a good amount of blackheads on my face. I was afraid to purchase the face mask (which I believe is step 2) since I wasn't sure if this helped clear my face. I've been using the cleanser, serum and moisturizer and very good results so far. Will update soon. Hopefully to purchase &#34;step 2&#34; soon.	2015-08-16

It leaves my skin hydrated and soft	Overall, the soap is pretty good. It leaves my skin hydrated and soft. I bought it for acne, and though tea tree is drying, this soap is not. Too soon to tell how it will help my acne. This is a very soft soap, not like some homemade soaps that are very hard. I think it will not last as long either. Which is fine, I actually hate the smell of it. But I hate the smell of tea tree, and knew that when I bought it. Though the soap does smell strong, it does not linger on my skin or stink up my bathroom, a plus in my book. So far, I am liking this company.	2015-08-16

This is the second bar I bought from this company. The smell of this bar is very light and will not linger on your skin. What I like about their soap is it doesn't have that weird goat smell that alot of goat milk soaps have. This bar has small pieces of oatmeal for exfoliation, and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated after use. The bars from this company are soft, not hard like some homemade soaps, and will probably be used up quicker. But that is okay with me, lets me try others.	2015-08-16

It also has a nice pivot which makes it easier to hold as well as making it more comfortable at shaving time.<br />Its Lithium battery holds a charge for 60 minutes and it also has a 5 minute quick charge that is supposed to work in a pinch which I didn't test.<br />Aside from giving a nice close shave with no detectable stubble, it trims nicely around the neck and sideburns. The battery charge remained consistent but you can also use this corded if necessary.<br />Clean-up is easy as this can be cleaned under water but swishing the shaving head under water.<br />While this isn't a high end shaver, it is a good entry level one. It is light yet substantial enough to offer a reasonable life span and it lives up to the manufacturer's promises.	2015-08-16

However, while Stridex brags about being alcohol-free, the wipes feel and act exactly like they have alcohol in them- they're very drying initially, and then my skin overproduces oil in a few hours to compensate. But by that point I usually have access to a face wash and moisturizer, so these are a decent temporary fix.<br /><br />It's also a bit disappointing that the pads aren't individually wrapped like wetwipes, since carrying the jar full of them isn't as efficient.	2015-08-16

The shave is not smooth, razor pulls and in general does not work. Takes 15 minutes to shave and then stubble is left.  Also very loud compared to the one that came with the razor and is not as easy to clean. This product is very poor quality. Should have kept the head that came with the razor.  Even worn out it worked better then the RQ12+ replacement. Now no choice but to throw my $170 1250 shaver in the trash any buy something else.

I actually found I preferred this method, I've used suction cups before and they tend to not stick well in some cases, and they stick out a bit which could make the mirror rock. With the hook method they use it's pretty secure and doesn't move at all. You do have to peel off some paper from the back of the mirror and a plastic sheet from the front, not a big deal. It also comes with an adhesive hook perfect for holding your razor. I use the Dollar Shave club 4 blade razor and you can see in the pic it holds it perfectly. The mirror actually worked really well. Water just falls off of it and it did not fog at all even when taking a very hot shower. After using this I would definitely recommend it. Do make sure you mount it where you want it though because you can't adjust it once the initial hook is hung.<br /><br />----------------<br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would write a review about it.

Black and red	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Must have for Cosmetologists and for every day hair styling!	I received the HSI Professional heat resistant glove just in time to fix my hair for a date night with my husband. I took the glove out of the package and slipped it onto my hand easily. I warmed my flat iron up and proceeded to straighten my hair with ease. I felt warmth thru the glove, but it protected my hand from being burned. I have burned my forehead and fingers before from fumbling around with my hot flat iron. The glove gives you more control and makes it so much easier to hold the fat iron in place. The material is flexible enough to move easily and use your hand normally. I have since tried it with my curling iron and it worked like a charm. I wish I had found this genius item sooner. It took 2 weeks for the burn on my head to heal and it made washing and fixing my hair almost unbearable. Now I just reach for the glove.

From a 22 yr old stereotypically hairy Italian guy: I think this is pretty good. It can be a bit awkward to hold at times because the handle is a bit bigger than it could have been. I'm relatively satisfied with all the different attachment heads, I mostly use the standard one with the cutting area going in the same direction as the handle. They all work pretty well, but hair does get caught and pulled a bit on some of the denser areas. The main thing I really don't like about this is how loud it is, it is extremely loud for what it is. Also, another reason why I'm giving this 3 stars instead of more is that they make women's groomers and trimmers that work significantly better than this one, and that are much quieter. For an extra 4 or 5 dollars I'd look into ordering a woman's trimmer, Panasonic makes some good ones, and just try those. I'm willing to use a pink or purple trimmer if it mean better quality and ease of use.	2015-08-16

I bought this with the intention of buying the full size but wanted to make sure it was the color I was looking for. This is a nice warm brown shade, not orange. The cocoa smell is not overpowering; I don't notice it once it's on. I have olive skin and I think this gives me a nice sun kissed glow. I was hoping I could use it as a contour as well but it didn't build up to be dark enough for me. I bought the full size and use it daily in place of my old bronzer. I like that I have this small sample size still left over for traveling or just to keep in my purse to use as a touch up. If you're worried about whether $30+ is worth it, I would recommend purchasing this sample and give it a shot first. It's also vegan and animal cruelty free :)	2015-08-16

It absorbs well, no over-lotion glob lines, and the shimmer is quite nice - not glitter but a more subtle transparent kind of shimmer, but you can see it - especially in the sun.

MaggardRazors sells a sampler pack of ToOBS scents which I'm quite happy I purchased.  I NEVER would have tried the coconut if I hadn't.  As someone who only somewhat enjoys coconut (coconut everything - milk, flavor, flakes, scent), I will say that this is one of the greatest scents I've ever smelled in my life.  It's not pure coconut.  There's more to it.  I don't have a nose for separating scents like others do, but I'd love to hear what else is actually in this.<br /><br />As far as the shave itself, ToOBS is popular for a reason.  I've used everything from hard soaps to soft creams and this is one of my favorites yet.  Something worth noting - this is a thirsty cream.  If you feel like you need more, try adding a little more water first.  You'll be pleased with how much longer the tub will last.	2015-08-16

The bar I'm currently using looks like it will last for a pretty long time. I have shoulder length hair that is pretty thick, however it is fine and curly in texture. This product will strip fine curly hair. That being said, if you wash and then apply a small amount of coconut or olive oil, your hair will survive the ordeal. Don't use a lot of oil though, it won't go well. :) I am currently on the look out for a good bar conditioner for my hair to pair with this product, however Maple Hill Naturals themselves don't make any at this time.	2015-08-16

I did receive a sample of these and was dissapointed I never ordered these.My first reaction upon opening the jar was the fresh Banana scent.I love Bananas and wasnt surprised how awesomely good these little scrubbies smell.Anyway I cut in half and ran under water and in a generously applied this in circular motion over my face.Probably for about 3 minutes than rinsed and my face felt so clean fresh,and subtle.Left my face with natural good coloring.I even had my Husband use the other half and these suck the oil right out of the pores on his nose.Yes he like these and  is taking more caution now than ever on what he puts on his face.I think these are suited for anyone no matter what type of skin you have.My 17 year old is also using these and wow these are perfect for teens who are always on the go and sometimes  put their own skin care on the back burner.With these it makes their life easier. That said I'm gonna go through these fast so I'm already planning on placing an order for more.	2015-08-16

Zinc Oxide + Minerals In This Tinted Sunscreen Protects, Moisturizes And Blends Well To Provide A Rich, Youthful Glow!	Beauty	5	27	33	N	N	A sunscreen and a make up in one that I now use daily	Until this product, I have hated all types of sunscreen. They smell terrible. The white color takes awhile to work into your skin. Even then, you still have a hint of the white sunscreen left. The consistency is that of a gunky goop. As a redhead, I have become a sunscreen expert over the years. So many products don't provide enough coverage and still leave me burnt.  This sunscreen has solved all of those problems and added extra benefits that make this an necessary item to have.<br /><br />After purchasing, this sunscreen arrived very quickly. When you squeeze the sunscreen out of the bottle, you notice the light brown tint to it. The consistency is a very smooth even cream that spreads with ease over your skin. The tint to it enables me to easily see where I have applied it. What I didn't realize until I first used it was the makeup application of this product. I can actually use it as a foundation as well as a sunscreen. When you apply the cream to your face, it provides an even tone throughout it. It doesn't leave that heaviness that most foundations leave either. You honestly don't realize that you have anything on in the first place. As a woman who likes it to appear that she has no makeup on, I really enjoyed the double use of this sunscreen. The smell is like a very light lotion smell. Not even close to the strong smelling sunscreen that other products have.<br /><br />Overall, I am highly please with this. It has become an item that's daily used. I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion, but that does not discount the amazing benefits to this outstanding product.	2015-08-16

They added a ton more holes to the top and made the gel thinner, which resulted in a huge mess every time I used it.<br /><br />I swapped to this in hopes of finding something a bit less messy, and it's on the mark for the most part. My only complaint is the number of holes again. It's so easy to turn the dial a fraction of a degree too far and end up with may more product than needed. It seems to especially be an issue with a brand new tube since there's usually a lot of airspace at the top, and transport can cause the gel to be uneven and want to gush out of one side or the other.<br /><br />Aside from the minor complaint, I'm happy with the product.	2015-08-16

Also the product seems more &#34;runny&#34; or &#34;soupy&#34; than similar products from other high end shaving creams like Castle Forbes or Trumper.  Per suggestions from others I tried to put it into the fridge and it didn't appear to make it more solid.  The reason I gave it 4 stars (almost perfect) is I used the product today and the runny consistency does not affect the performance.  I got a really nice 4 pass shave with just a dip into the jar.  Also the smell of the roses was just right - not too heavy or perfumy.  I'm wondering if this is a manufacturing issue or a storage issue?	2015-08-16

My daughter has waist length,  thick,  wavy light brown hair.  We did streaks all over and it turned out beautiful.  Once the color is dry simply brush it thru and there is no lingering chalky feel and the color does  not rub off.  It lasted 3 shampoos and did not damage her hair in any way.  I suspect the people reporting trouble simply squeezed globs of color directly onto their hair and hoped for the best.  Follow the directions and you will love the results.	2015-08-16

I am not a coffee drinker, but I love the smell of freshly brewed or ground coffee beans. I just can't get over how amazing this smells. If there is any essential oil that is an exact smell, this is it. This give such a feeling f vibrancy and wakefulness without the actual consumption of coffee itself. If you are looking for an essential oil to add in your diffuser or give any skin care a coffee scent this is the one that will do it. I definitely want to get one to leave at the office too. I also wanted to mention the added labeling to the cap for easy finding if you store it side by side. By the way adding it with coconut is delectable.

You don't need much of it at all! It is clear and goes on easy. Since I started using it I have had people ask me what I am using, if it was a new make up or what. I tell them it is ArtNaturals eye cream. And I send them the link to Amazon so they can order it for themselves to try.  I was fortunate to receive this free to try so I could give my honest opinion and review on it. I am so glad I was. I have sensitive eyes, and I have to be so careful what I put on them. I can't even wear any type of eye shadow on them. How ever this product does not cause me any probs at all.	2015-08-16

Works great! I have PCOS which gives heavy patches of deep set coarse hair on my chin that tweezing was the only way to pull them out. Waxing doesn't work at all since they are so deep in my skin.

Though it was soft and did not tangle easily, it wasnt as full as the picture had shown and definitely was not as curly. The bangs need a lot of trimming and the wig itself was a bit small and didnt cover my whole head. I have a normal sized head but i do have a lot of hair that might be part of the problem.  It is a bit thin up top and does shed but then again its fresh out of the package. Its not an awful wig but i regret getting it and it will need a lot of styling.

It's a non drip formula so no mess at all !<br />I'm very impressed by how easy and clean all the process was.... and the odor ! it has the most pleasant smell of all professional/box dyes I've used in the past.<br />Now, the results: I'm a curly girl with hair down to my shoulders (so i used one box -the whole thing-) my hair is naturally medium-light brown and It turned out to be an even, very very ashy light brown.

I have tried Obagi, Rodan and Fields and various skin regimen over the years. My main problem is I still have ocassional breakouts (huge cystic acne every month) and my skin always looks tired w/multiple dry patches all over. When I first tried it, my neck got irritated and it had these little red bumps so I stopped using it on my neck but continued using it over my face once a day. The serum felt smooth, non-sticky and I loved its citrus-y smell. Before long, my BF noticed that my skin had a glow. I was so excited! My pores are still the same but my skin is definitely smoother. Just the other day when I woke up, I looked into the mirror and thought I already had foundation on. I definitely recommend it!!	2015-08-16

Wrinkles, fine lines, and skin tone will improve with twice-daily use of this Alice Nouveau serum.  Not only that, it reduces the appearance of dark spots and helps prevent clogged pores.<br /><br />This Alice Nouveau anti-aging serum is a blend of organic and natural ingredients and is free from alcohols, parabens, and sulphates, which may irritate your skin.  It contains retinol, hyaluronic acid, green tea, Vitamin E, and jojoba oil.  Your serum is manufactured in the USA under strict controls in an FDA approved facility.<br /><br />Facial serums can give you added moisture and you'll want to use a serum to get added nutrients deeper into the layers of your skin where a regular moisturizer is not able to reach.  The antioxidants in your facial serum can take up to 4 weeks to completely soak into the skin and remove toxins that cause dullness, dryness, and discoloration.<br /><br />The serum comes in a sturdy bottle with a pump that won't clog or break.  The lid is tight so not even a drop of serum will be wasted on a spill.  Just one pump of the anti-wrinkle serum covers a large area and about two pumps covers your whole face and neck.  The 1 fluid ounce bottle should last you for quite some time.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good quality anti-aging facial serum, then you should get yourself some Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum today.<br /><br />I'm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-16

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Heaven in a Tube	I must have about 15 different facial masks in my beauty arsenal, most of which I try once and forget about. Not this one. This mask is the only one I use ALL the time. It's very gentle so you can use it every day if you want to. I usually put it on at night after taking my makeup off and it makes my skin feel unbelievably hydrated and refreshed. Another bonus I've discovered: I get migraines very often and have started using this mask to help ease the pain. It really works - gives your skin a nice cooling sensation and relaxes your muscles. Within about 10 minutes I notice that the pain is almost completely gone. If this product ever gets discontinued I'll probably go nuts.	2015-08-16

I accepted to test this cream for review purposes with more curiosity than high expectations because my target area is notoriously tough to improve.  I had gained weight and then finally lost some, and was doing my best with exercise and my Slendertone belt, but as long as that little cushion of fat remained over my stomach, I could never see the full impact of my efforts.<br /><br />That's where this cream comes in.  My stomach problem was not really cellulite but a different type of subcutaneous fat and very difficult to shift.  I must stress that, good as the cream is, it takes time to see results.  It will not magically melt away fatty bulges, it will not reduce your waistline measurement all by itself, and it does not claim to remove stretch marks, but it will improve the elasticity and tone of your skin.  It can make all the difference when your shape is improving, but the skin texture lets you down.  Loose, wrinkly skin is so ageing, as much on the body as it is on the face, but specialist creams like this one are difficult to find.  I'm very glad I gave this a try because the improvement, once it starts to show, is very pleasing.<br /><br />The cream comes in a medium-sized soft tube (150 ml) and has a fairly thick consistency.  It becomes very white as you spread it, and stays creamy for a while, allowing a good, long massage, which also helps.  Once absorbed, there is no residue.  Among the main active ingredients are caffeine, Vitamin C, carnitine, and algae extracts. It smells deliciously of essential oils and, like the rest of the 180 Cosmetics range, it is a natural product without any toxic chemical additives.  All their products are also cruelty-free, and not tested on animals.<br /><br />So, if you have the patience and determination to address your imperfect skin, this product will be a great help, but it will be a very gradual process.  Some improvement, however, is easy to see quite quickly.  If your skin is at all lined, with surface creases and a general dry look, this cream will make an immediate impact that goes beyond just moisturizing.  You will also get the uplifting, mood-improving benefits of massage, even though you are doing it yourself.  The only negative I found is that the cap stopped closing after a couple of uses, so I decanted the tube contents into a jar.  It seems to me that this cream would be very helpful during weight loss, even more than afterwards, as the skin would not a have a chance to become loose in the first place.you have the patience and determination to address your imperfect skin, this product will be a great help, but it will be a very gradual process.

If you aren't used to glycolics go easy.  It's not harsh, but you can get some purging.  I have used other AHAs mostly in creams. I use this to clean out the pores on my nose and near it.	2015-08-16

After 30+ years of applying make up with the flimsy spongey applicator that comes with make up, i decided to try my first set of professional brushes. Whoa... I cannot believe what a difference it makes. First of all, my make up goes on so much smoother and it does not clump up. I have so much more control which i really noticed with the liner brush. I've heard the complaints about other brands of brushes but the NKE brushes are really well made. They're the right firmness, no bristles were lost and thankfully the handles are marked for use.  They come in a nice organizer so i do not have to fumble around my make up bag looking for the right brush. Added bonus, i feel pretty cool using them:) I am very pleased with my purchase and encourage you other old dogs to try a new trick.	2015-08-16

I followed the directions and it worked just as described.  No mess and everything you need is included in the box, even the oil for after waxing (which I really liked and appreciated).  I used this for the peach fuzz on my upper lip and the sides of my face under my sideburn area and it worked great on the first try.  I love that the wax is in a nice little metal pan you just heat directly on the stove and then when you're done it hardens up and goes back in the box for next time.  Plenty wax for me to use maybe 15 times for such small areas if I had to guess. My only tip would be to make sure you don't let it cool too long or it will become brittle and harder to pull off in 1 piece.	2015-08-16

It's the kind of sunscreen that leaves a white cast and it takes a lot to rub it in properly. You will have to put on a small amount at a time. Also if your hair is dark I wouldn't recommend putting this on your hair. The smell is also mid-level, not too overwhelming but it still smells. Bottom line, if you are on a tight budget but still want a decent non-chemical sunscreen, get this one. But there are much better mineral sunscreens out there.	2015-08-16

I am reviewing the Braun Series 9 9090cc Electric Shaver that I received as part of a product promotion from the brand. Let me start by saying this is a great product.  I had my concerns at first, but after a week of using the Braun Series 9 shaver, I'm sold.  A little about me: I am dark complected with very thick, course, facial hair. I also shave my head daily.  For the past few years, I have been using a double edge safety razor, with a traditional shave cream and brush on my face.  On my head I have been using disposable cartridge razors (after trying various razors designed specifically for shaving heads with disastrous results).<br />When picking up the Braun Series 9 my initial concerns were:<br />1. Would it give me a close enough shave to compare with the safety razor?<br />2. Would it irritate my neck and produce razor bumps like other electric razors I have tried in the past did?<br />3. Would it be quick and versatile enough to shave my head daily?<br />4. Would it be easy to travel with?<br />5. Would it be easy to clean and maintain?<br />After a week of using the Braun Series 9 I can answer yes to each of these questions.  The shaver is quick and gentle, providing a close comfortable shave on both my face and head.  It quickly attacks the hard to reach stubble on my neck and behind my ears without irritating my skin or leaving shave bumps.  It eliminates the mess of shave cream and the time it takes to whip up a good lather.  It navigates around my mustache and goatee without snagging and pulling on the hair that I want to keep.<br />Cleanup is quick and simple.  I just drop the shaver into the charging/cleaning station and it does all the work for me.<br />On the second day that I had the shaver, I had to leave town for a quick, two day, business trip.  I put the shaver in the included travel case and tossed it into my overnight bag.  Traveling with the Braun Series 9 was significantly easier, cleaner and more compact than with my previous shaving kit and the charge was more than enough to last a couple of days without recharging.<br />In short, I would definitely recommend the Braun Series 9 shaver without hesitation.t a couple of days without recharging. In short, I would definitely recommend the Braun Series 9 shaver without hesitation.	2015-08-16

I purchased this item in the hopes it might work. I can assure you that this product by itself has not worked for me. I have not tried to combine it with the other products suggested from the same company. I have used it daily as directed for about 3 weeks (I used it from a friend first then I purchased my own - this has not worked for either of us). The fact that this does not work, in addition to the obviously fradaulent reviews, means I will never be purchasing product from this seller again. For all I know, this product may work great in addition to their shampoo or whatever. Frankly, it seems more like a scam to be. Buyers beware, steer away.<br /><br />Edit: In case anyone is wondering how I know the reviews are fake. Another reviewer made it pretty clear - all the other reviewers have given similar 5 star reviews on all the same type of products (programming, pet related things, all the same...often times even the same books).	2015-08-16

I purchased this mosturizer and the eye gel together.  I love both.  I was in search of an organic mosturizer as I have sensative skin and usually break out when I try new products - I did not with this one.  I don't have to use much and I can say that this mosturizer is better than any others I've tried (and I've tried expensive - Clinique and in-expensive, Nutrogena, Oil of Olay, etc.).  It goes on very easily, dries quickly and doesn't leave my face feeling oily.  Great product!	2015-08-16

Oz	Beauty	5	1	1	N	N	Mostly organic and tingly	After having kids, my belly isn't what it used to be. I decided to give the anti cellulite cream (more of a cross between a cream and a gel)  a shot and see if I could help the issue. The cream is orange and tingles. When you wipe it on the skin, it feels warm at first, then minty and cool. It feels like ice almost. The ingredients are mostly organic (87%) and they work very quickly. I noticed within a day or two, having used a small amount a few times a day, my skin already looks tighter and healthier. I wouldn't use this at night as it makes it hard to sleep when your skin feels like ice. It reminds me of the feeling when you have a mint and then drink cold water. The jar is a good enough size that it should last about a month since you don't need a ton of it.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

It's made in Japan by hand and is quite different than American made Konjac Sponges (this info is on their website).  I've found American made ones to be too soft with a perfect cut.  The Japanese Konjac Sponge is still gentle, but more effective.  It's not created by a bunch of machines in a factory, so it doesn't have a perfect shape.  It's bigger, too.  It feels like it's made with more care and quality.  Even the string is much better quality.  I've had this one for a few weeks, and the string hasn't broken, and the sponge is still good as new.  As far as the type (meaning Cherry Blossom, Green Tea, Charcoal, etc) I can't tell a difference between them with any of the brands.	2015-08-16

Thie IT Cosmetics Luxe High Performance Eyeshadow Trio (Pretty in Spring) are perfect colors all year for me, since I primarily only wear browns when it comes to shadows.<br /><br />This color palette is rich, yet subtle at the same time. It goes on smoothly, does not crease, and I've worn it from dawn to dusk. It doesn't irritate my skin and I simply love it!<br /><br />I can see it lasting for a long time, too. I'm thinking about looking for another color palette to have a change from time to time, and it will be IT Cosmetics, I assure you.	2015-08-16

How many of you love going to the nail salon to get pampered and get your nails done? I know I do. The problem though? I can't afford to do that every couple weeks or so, but I still love to get it done and feel pampered. With this Nova Microdermabrasion Electric Salon Device I can do mine and other people's nails from home. With 25 sanding bands, you can do quite a bit of nails. The foot pedal helps this machine run smoothly, it's easy to get the hang of depending on if you need to file down, clip cuticles, and all that good stuff. You can easily change the head on the drill and change directions in which the drill will spin. It even comes with some gems/nail decorations to apply as well. I was given the opportunity to receive this for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.	2015-08-16

I was patient, wore it for an entire day, hoping the scent would improve and that I would grow to love it, and still, I couldn't get over this powerful looming oder.  Just in case it was just me, I asked my husband what he thought, and he said, &#34;well, if you like it&#34;.  I think this might be man code for &#34;YUCK&#34;.

This didn't do much for my golden blond color treated hair.  It didn't add a lot of golden color but it's a decent cleansing shampoo nonetheless and I used the entire bottle, although I won't repurchase it.  I have a big problem with the glass bottle, which gets slippery in the shower and it's rather dangerous.  I don't know why any company would package a shampoo in a glass bottle.  I also used the golden conditioner and even together, they didn't make much of an impact.  Again, the conditioner is in a jar, which is awkward to unscrew with wet hands and again, it's glass.  This is a problem for me and regardless of the fact that the shampoo and conditioner didn't work very well, I would never again have glass containers in the shower.  I've found a much better product in Tressa Watercolors shampoo in the golden tone.  It lathers like crazy, is sulfate free and definitely adds nice golden color when left on for 5-10 minutes.  Also good is Blond Brilliance lathering toner in the warm tone. Also sulfate free, it leaves my hair soft and shiny and it lathers really well and smells divine.  These two brands work much better than Davines and both are less expensive.  I purchased the Tressa shampoo on Amazon and Blond Brilliance is at Sally Beauty Supply.  I found that both of these products are superior to Davines and neither comes in a glass container, lol!  I recommend Davines only for cleansing and not for adding color.  Tressa and Blond Brilliance both add a lot of color and both keep my hair in really good condition and full of shine.	2015-08-16

As I was packing my bag, the bottle dropped from the counter, and splattered all over the tile bathroom floor. I will have to wait now to re-order. That was very disappointing.

First, I believe this is the older formulaOlay product, and is a purple colored cream.  The newer stuff you get at the store is white.  Not sure of the quality difference, but I have to come to the conclusion that new and improved does not always mean better (Think old Coke and New Coke, as well as Ragu sauce, that I loved until they changed it to a &#34;new and improved&#34; taste.)<br /><br />Anyway, the price is great.  Three jars for $30 as opposed to one jar for $17 at the store.  Also, my wife preferred the older purple cream that these are and was upset over the change and she is now glad she got the purple cream.<br /><br />She has noticed no difference, and claims it is the same to her performance wise.  However, I have pointed out to her that she has been using this product for 20 years now, and yet she looks older now than when she started using it.  You can see my reviews for couch pillows and a couch blanket recently purchased by me on Amazon.  Some women can not take a joke.  And those that can, find no humor in their aging.  Seriously.  I guess we men just get distinguished looking, whereas women simply degrade and fall apart.  (I supposed I should order a Snuggie now just in case she reads that last comment.)  Someone stated that this stuff was meant for the asian market, whereas the white stuff is for us Americans.  Well hell, if this will make my wife look more like one of them hot asian women, well, tell me where I can buy a five gallon bucket and dunk my wife's big fat.....errr I mean have enough on hand for my beautiful bride of over 30 years so she will never run out...OMG...thirty...really?<br /><br />So yes, older formula, but unless someone can tell me the difference in performance from this and the newer and improved stuff, I'll take that savings and use it to make my couch more comfortable, or maybe some anti-snoring products or diet pills or exerciser things (does Suzanne Somers still sell them butter-master thing-a-ma-jigs) for the wifewhen (if) she lets me back in bed.	2015-08-16

Even after it dries it is very sticky so you should put a thin layer of clear gloss or aquaphor or something and it's manageable. The first ingredient is SD alcochol, so if you have any small cuts or even exfoliated lips it's stings a tiny bit.. (nothing I would cry over but I don't particularly look forward to something as mundane as putting on lipstick having to be painful) I'm not buying anymore.<br /><br />And the search continues for kiss proof, long wearing lipstain..next I'll probably try Mehru lip dye..	2015-08-16

We ended up making Shea Lotion Bars, which were very simple.<br />The block I received did have a slight odor that I didn't really care for. It was very subtle and when we mixed the Butter with other oils and scents you could no longer smell the original scent. Ingredients<br />2 ounces (1/4 cup) shea butter<br />2 ounces (1/4 cup) beeswax pastilles<br />3 tablespoons coconut oil<br />10 drops of essential oils of your choice (optional)<br /><br />Instructions<br />In a double boiler, melt shea butter and beeswax over medium low heat. (I just used a large glass bowl sitting on top of a small pot of water. I’ve also used a Pyrex measuring cup sitting inside a pot of water – this method makes it easy to pour melted lotion base into mold)<br />When shea butter and beeswax are nearly melted, add coconut oil (which will melt very quickly). Stir. Add essential oils, if desired.<br />Pour melted lotion base into mold (I used 1.5 inch square brownie molds, but any molds will do) and let cool until completely solid (this will take several hours).<br />Remove lotion bars from molds and store in a cool, dry place. Note: heat will re-melt the lotion bars, so if for some reason you need to re-mold, just heat and start over.<br />To use: simply rub lotion bars in between your hands to activate. Your body heat will melt/soften the bars just enough to give you some good lotion to apply anywhere, even your lips! I rub the bars straight onto my lips, just like lip balm.<br /><br />We also mixed up a quick batch of Eczema Cream to give to a family friend of ours for her son. She said it smelled really good and it actually worked really well. No oily leftovers and easy to wash off in the shower/bath.<br />Ingredients:<br />1/4 cup shea butter<br />1/4 cup coconut oil<br />15 drops lavender essential oil, therapeutic grade only. (where to buy essential oils)<br />5 drops tea tree essential oil, therapeutic grade only. (where to buy essential oils)<br /><br />Directions:<br />Fill a saucepan halfway full with water.  Heat the water over medium high heat ( not boil).<br />In a small jar add the shea butter and the coconut oil.<br />Place jar in the saucepan (like a makeshift double boiler) until the oils melt.<br />Remove the jar and cool for a few minutes to about room temp before adding in the oils.<br />Mix the essential oil into coconut/shea mixture and put the jar in the fridge until done, should be firm to touch.<br /> You can use the eczema cream at this point, but if you’d like more of a “whipped” body butter lotion then put the oil in a kitchen aid stand mixer and mix on high for several minutes until the eczema cream looks like whipped butter.  You may have to scrape the sides of the mixer down a few times.  Apply liberally to any affected area of the skin.<br /><br />I did receive this product for review purposes.

I have a 19-month-old blue-eyed, blond-haired, extremely fair-skinned little girl. I have exclusively used Honest sunscreen on her since she was old enough for sunscreen (after 6 months), and she has never once had a sunburn. She is outdoors most of the day during the summer, swimming in our backyard. We have gone through several tubes of this sunscreen and besides the fact that it does have a greasy texture, I have zero complaints. I have also used it on myself without any problems, and like my daughter, I have very, very pale skin (sometimes even the lightest shade of makeup is too dark for me). I am shocked by all the reviews saying that people have experienced sunburns after using this sunscreen. The only thing I can think of is that maybe there is a bad batch out there. I've used tubes that I ordered directly from Honest.com, and I have never purchased it from a retail store or Costco.	2015-08-16

All natural and fluffy!	This cream is all natural and has a nice whipped consistency. It is light and airy and smells nice. It comes in a huge 4 ounce jar which I have never seen facial products come in. They are usually under 2 ounces. I love the consistency of this cream and I like that there is nothing artificial in it. However, the ingredients, while nourishing, really don't target fine lines and other aging signs. They hydrate, which is a big part of looking youthful, but there aren't antioxidants to ward off free radicals nor are there acids and vitamins that are proven to help with the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and sagging.<br /><br />As a moisturizer, this one is good. It isn't greasy and it doesn't cause my skin any irritation. I have been using it more as a body butter than a face cream because I need certain ingredients in my creams. It works beautifully as a body butter. It softens my skin and leaves no residue behind. It's light yet hydrating. For younger skin, this is great on the face. I am 50 and I look for certain ingredients that have been proven to work. I do use serums containing Vitamin C and hyraluranic acid among other things but I still need a heavier and more potent face cream. I will continue to use this beautifully whopped cream on my body and may buy more. It is definitely better than the chemical laden body butters I own now. I will also use it on my face from time to time as it does a nice job of hydrating without being greasy and and it is gentle.<br /><br />I have to go with my gut though and rate this 3 stars only because it doesn't have what my aging skin needs to help hold back the ends of time. The ingredients are good, don't get me wrong, just not what I personally look for in an anti aging facial cream. But for the body? It's like buttah!<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my evaluation and honest review. Obviously I was not obligated to rate in any certain way and I rated as I felt I should. However, I do recommend this cream to younger people who don't need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter. It may also work for aging facial skin. I just like my creams to have a more proven ingredients in them. All natural though is very desirable and healthy.eople who don't need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter. It may also work for aging facial skin.

Worth every cent.	After three weeks I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  This is a very dense stick and it is absolutely unscented.  I do not shave my underarms and sometimes have overused deodorant sticks to guarantee coverage down to my skin.  I was a bit concerned with the reviews that mentioned irritation, but I decided to take the chance since I wanted as natural a product as possible.  I have had zero irritation and it only takes me 3 - 4 strokes on hairy pits to get the coverage I need.  I generally only apply once per 24 hours and I have even gone for as long as 48 hours.  I would buy this product again and I expect this tube to last for quite a long time based on the density and how much I use.	2015-08-16

I think that if you used chopped sticks, or needle nosed pliers instead of these tweezers you would be much better off. ;)  They do not grasp hairs very well at all. The tip is too bulbous as far as I am concerned. You need a finer tip to get those fine hairs that men have to deal with. The tip needs to be able to grasp and hold onto a hair in order to &#34;pluck&#34; it out. I like the scissor style tweezers...but, not this one.	2015-08-16

I had my hair highlighted sometime back. I have light brown hair as my natural color. Highlighting was offered to me as just a shade lighter than my natural color. And I agreed. Well, despite using color care shampoo, it became bright and brassy pretty quickly. Two attempts in that salon and another one only gave me another weird shade that quickly washed out to brassy again. So after months of just living with it since the last time, I decided enough was enough. I would color it myself. I had someone with me when I bought the permanent hair dye from a store to help me get a good match for my coloring. The test strand looked great, a light warm shade of brown. So, I did it...and my entire head of hair was BLACK - unnatural, looked like I went Goth black. I wore a baseball cap, took a deep breath, and decided to try this product. And yes, it worked! I did a test strand first at 10 minutes. That worked well, pulling out the black to brown., Then I covered my whole hair - minus the test strand - for ten minutes. It turned out great - ALL the black gone, down to a natural looking shade of light brown. Not perfect, but definitely I could live with it now and go out in public without shame and a baseball cap. To me, it does smell AWFUL, just like rotten eggs like someone said. BUT I can bear a bad smell to get my hair looking human on me again.	2015-08-16

Since our daughter plays soccer, she wanted to wear something like her favorite player and I headed to Amazon and found this styling wrap.  It is easy to use - the instructions have you wrap it around the thigh of the person wearing it and then rolling it down your leg to get the right size- but my daughter clearly has a giant head because at that size, it squeezed her poor head.  When I used my thigh to make one for her, it fit just fine.  This is exactly what she wanted and she is thrilled to wear a headband like Alex Morgan at every game.	2015-08-16

I have to tell you that at first I was leery about this head shaver, but after using it, I was blown away at the ease of the shave and especially the results. As a long time head shaving guy, I usually have to go over certain spots many, many times to get it smooth. The wheels on the shaver seem to keep the blades at the perfect angle and the blades provide a easy very smooth shave with little effort. I'm not yet sure how many shaves I'll get on one blade, but so far I love these blades.	2015-08-16

I was so impressed with the quality of product and service, I ordered a second bottle for a friend.  I suffer from multiple health issues, but cannot take oral medication for inflammation.  I find that emu oil helps with pain and I can function better.  The benefits to skin and hair growth are an added plus for me.  While emu oil is not a cure it all, it greatly increases my quality of life.  I like the pump bottle which makes application, especially after showering much easier.  I am most satisfied with the company and their product, and am seldom moved to recommend things online.  Thank you.	2015-08-16

Unlike other thicker consistency creams, this one provides great hydration while not exacerbating my acne. If matte is what you're after, this likely isn't the product for you; instead, the sheen that displeased another reviewer creates, at least for me, a dewy, more youthful appearance. Liquid foundation applies smoothly over top, which I don't find is the case for a lot of thicker creams. The SPF is an added plus. Overall, I'm a huge fan of this product.	2015-08-16

I'm not a big believer in most supplements, but I'm a huge believer in the results I'm seeing from taking Phytoceramides.<br /><br />I've been taking Phytoceramides for nearly six months now, so I can share a bit about how well these have worked for me so far. Within a few weeks after I began taking Phytoceramides I noticed more fullness to my cheeks, and a visible reduction in the sagging at the jowls. After a little more than a month the bagginess under my eyes was cleared up, and the toothpick lines at the bridge of my nose were harder to see. After taking them for a little over two months I continued to see those positive changes getting more pronounced, and my face was definitely still filling back out. I'm a week short of 6 months since I started taking them now and I no longer have any saggy jowls, and only have baggy eyes if allergies are bothering me (and they clear up after I take a Zantac for allergies). I not only see positive changes, but looking better again has helped me feel more confident enough to get out and socialize more.<br /><br />These Phytoceramides are 100% all natural, made in the USA , and are gluten free since they're rice derived. That's important to know because there have been numerous studies that show 40mg of rice derived Phytoceramides are more potent than wheat or sweet potato based Phytoceramides and give faster and superior results. The bottle contains 30 medium sized capsules, and the recommended dose is one capsule a day. I generally take one capsule each morning with a full glass of water about 20 - 30 minutes before mealtime, and I haven't had any ill effects whatsoever.<br /><br />On top of being more effective than wheat or sweet potato derived Phytoceramides, these are gluten free as well which is important to the growing percent of the population who suffer from wheat allergies. This brand also includes the recommended daily does of vitamins A, C, D, and E which help us rebuild healthy tissues faster. I have seen a definite improvement in my appearance, skin tone, and feelings about my appearance since starting to take Phytoceramides. To me, there is no question that taking Phytoceramides helps to improve and even reverse the root causes of wrinkles and other signs of aging, so I intend to continue taking them.<br /><br />Promotional discount received for evaluation, testing, and review purposes.ite improvement in my appearance, skin tone, and feelings about my appearance since starting to take Phytoceramides.

And that's not good since I already have dry mouth problems due to certain prescription medications I take.<br />The cost of this product is too high for what you get. Using both Biotene with the Arm & Hammer gell costed less & gave me better results.<br />I'm not paid to test products, but I do try my best to give real explanations for why something is great or not good. And if it's not good, I may suggest another product as I did here.<br />If you have dental problems, research products before trying them & get the advice of a dentist. Go to a county dental clinic before waiting your money like I did.<br />*The health of your gums & teeth has effects on your entire body! If you have gum disease or need fillings it's likely that your antibodies are working overtime. The infection that is in your mouth easily gets into your bloodstream & hurts your organs! Prevention is the best course. Otherwise get your teeth cleaned & problems fixed & then start a new with good oral care!	2015-08-16

(Blend of: Peppermint, Rosemary, Lemon and Eucalyptus)	Beauty	5	1	1	N	N	Smells wonderful and gets me going in the morning...	[[VIDEOID:f81851ea21146ce18563cd4715614b49]]This review is for the Plant Therapy Energy Synergy Essential Oil Blend (Physical Energy). 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.<br /><br />This oil smells FANTASTIC! It is such a high energy blend, but at the same time it maintains its sweet, floral scent. I think this is one of my favorite scents to diffuse in my house! I love Plant Therapy's oils. They are unique blends - and high quality oils at that. The oil is thick and well mixed. The containers are large for the money you are paying.<br /><br />This blend is a mix of lemon, eucalyptus, rosemary and peppermint. The oils separately do the following:<br /><br />LEMON: An amazing detox and it promotes weight loss through release of water retention.<br />ROSEMARY: Works great as a disinfectant.<br />PEPPERMINT: Freshens the house and hides the smells. Energizing!<br />EUCALYPTUS: Helps stop the inflammation in my lungs and clear up my head.<br /><br />Together the blend gives ALL the benefits combined and creates a scent that really gets you going in the morning. I love to diffuse this before I head to the hospital in the morning and it starts my day right! 5/5 stars for scent, ingredients, and value.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-16

A quality tool for mustaches and beards.	If I have a few days (or more) of beard stubble, I use this before the razor. This is mainly what I bought it for and it works great, leaves the equivalent of about one day's growth (my growth is about medium, not heavy, not light). I wish I'd had this when I had my beard, it would be an excellent tool for beards. Before I shaved off my mustache, I used the Peanut for trimming and it really worked great! It worked great to shave off the mustache, too. I've removed my mustaches with various tools, and the Peanut is the best yet. I'm a craftsman who enjoys using good quality tools, and this is one of them.<br /><br />I've had the Peanut for a few months now and have used it to cut my own hair, with great results. One day my hair was way too long and it was time to go to the barber. I figured the barber could fix anything I did with the Wahl if I didn't cut it too short, so I decided to give it a try, and I haven't been to the barber since. I cut it when I haven't washed my hair for a few days. I put on the #4 stand-off and buzz it all over the sides and back (I go over it a few times, pausing to use a comb, until I get it to where it looks okay). I don't go too high up on the sides, just a trimmer-width or less over the ears, and somehow the top always seems to come out fine (staying long enough to part and comb nicely). Without any stand-off, I trim around the ears and trim-up the sideburns. With the #2 stand-off, I do my eyebrows. Using a hand mirror, I scissor off the the hair at the back of my neck if it's too long. Then I give it a good shampoo, and the next day if anything needs a little more trim (which about half the time it does) I give it a quick tune-up with the Wahl, and I'm good for about three weeks. This little baby is going to pay for itself pretty quickly, if it hasn't already.<br /><br />The Peanut is fairly quiet, too, doesn't hurt my ears at all. I've had three other electric hair clippers (full size) and the Peanut whips them all for sound and clean-cutting. About those other three: one died, one actually broke and fell apart while I was using it, and one is very dull and does not have replaceable blades like the Peanut.<br /><br />My only CON: I like very pliable cords that tend to hang straight, and this one is a little too stiff and plasticky, but I've seen worse.an-cutting.

Didn't buy from amazon but this is an amazing product. Usually my hand gets tired holding up a regular curling iron, but not with this as it sucks in the hair on its own. It's also extremely easy to operate. I only got it friday & have already used it twice without any issue of my hair getting tangled. Follow tne instructions and all will be ok. Just remember to use small bits of hair and make sure and clip away the hair you are not using until you are ready.

I honestly have no idea what the people who got the carrier were looking at.  I see a black beauty blender in the photo, in its standard little cylindrical clear plastic container.  The Air Port Pro is a small black mesh carrying case to use when you're traveling--it's a completely different item and does not include an actual Beauty Blender.  What are these people looking at??<br /><br />I ordered the Black Beauty Blender Pro Sponge and that's exactly what I received.  The reason I got the black one is that YouTube gurus recommend it for use with pressed powder foundation, i.e. MAC Studio Fix.  As I understand it, you can pick up this kind of foundation better with the black Beauty Blender because it's more porous.  And yes, you still have to dampen it.  I have yet to try this technique but since I love my pink Beauty Blenders I have no doubt I'll be fine with this one as well.	2015-08-16

The style holds for the whole day with my regular hair care routine.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this shampoo and conditioner combo is that they smell so good!  The scent reminds me of the bubble gum toothpaste that the dentist uses to clean your teeth.  Thankfully, I don’t smell like bubble gum all day, though.<br /><br />LuxeOrganix contains no sulfates, parabens, or sodium chloride; ingredients that are thought to possibly cause itchy scalp and serious skin irritation as well as disease, hair loss, and damage.<br /><br />A bonus of using LuxeOrganix is that they are a very proactive and communicative company and were great to work with.

I love how it made my legs so smooth.  Along with the epilator comes a spray to reduce the painful sensation of removing your hair from the fiolicle, a cord, a size reducer cover for smaller areas, and a cover.  After reading the manual they suggest that the best time to use the epilator is after a warm shower to open the pores.  I did one leg before the shower and one after to see if there really was a difference between the two and there is alot!  The leg that was before the shower was more painful and less short hair was removed (longer hairs had the same result with both of coming out painfully) and the one after the shower was easier and faster to remove.  The only down side was the cord was a little to short.  I had to keep turning to reach all the parts of my leg.  Overall this product did as described.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-16

Beauty	2	12	12	N	Y	Not enough for the money	I could tell a big difference since using hyaluronic acid for a week. Mybskin texture feels tighter and more toned. I could tell a difference on my forehead the most. However, I didn't like the fact that it comes in a bottle with a dropper. The texture of this is very thick and couldn't get the rest of the product out of the bottle. It goes rather quickly also. I used about a third a dropper morning and night and used it all in two weeks. I have since switched to another brand that comes in a jar and is a thinner texture and am loving it. I love the idea of what the hyaluronic acid does for the skin, just not this particular brand.	2015-08-16

However, after reading the Q&A I see that Uptown states to leave it on 5-15 minutes and then wash off. This is not listed anywhere on the box or the jar its self. If this is how it should be used, as a treatment, then that is how it should be marketed, not as a cleanser. I also would prefer to see this in a pump (if a cleanser) or a stand up tube (if a treatment). I don't really care for dipping into jars but I wanted to try this product. Also the directions do need to be larger on the jar as they are tiny and there is plenty of room to make them larger on the label and more obvious.<br /><br />As a cleanser my face nice after using it to wash; however, when I used toner afterwards, there was still make up on my face and I had to rewash my face with a regular cleanser. While there are no exfoliating 'beads' in this, the AHA is the exfoliater but again, using it as a cleanser I don't think you really get the full benefit of that unless you use something like a Konjac sponge with it. When I used this as a treatment on my already cleansed face, left this on for 5 minutes and then washed it off, I felt it did a much better job and it allowed the cream to do what it is designed to do with regard to cell renewal. Therefore, I believe I will reserve the rest to use as a treatment. Do not use this on or near your eyes to remove eye make up or as part of the treatment.<br /><br />This product is 80% organic and not tested on animals. This has some really great ingredients such as aloe, Apricot Kernel Oil, Vitamin E, Green Tea, Bilberry, Sugar Cane, Orange, Lemon and Cranberry Extract, Mango Butter, Willow Bark, Neem Oil, and Rosemary Extract. I know that Neem is great as a treatment on the face.<br /><br />I'm still giving this product 4 stars instead of 3 because it does make a great treatment. However, I didn't give it 5 because I feel the packing of the product and labeling/marketing of it as a correct product (cleanser or treatment) needs some work.	2015-08-16

The viscosity of the oil is good for getting it worked into the beard...I've had thicker stuff and it just didn't flow/massage in very well.  This thinner consistency also seems to penetrate the hair itself much better as my beard's a lot softer than after using previous products.<br />The scent is very interesting...I'd describe it as how us mid-westerners think the beach/ocean smells...very fresh, almost a saltiness, but without the dead fish odor of course.  My wife very much likes the scent on my beard too.	2015-08-16

I own two of them, one for home and one in a travel kit.  They are easy to maintain--I just use standard shampoo to wash them when they begin to get a little oily and collect dust.  They show no ill effects from doing this.  I like how they glide through my hair, unlike other plastic bristle brushes that can pull.  My hair is now thinning and I've started wearing it short (goodbye to my once long, flowing mane) and these brushes seem made for shorter hair.<br /><br />Considering the low price and good quality, I highly recommend this brush.	2015-08-16

Nothing solves dry skin problems on the feet better than this.  I also use it on the ends of my hair after blow drying it and it repairs split ends until I can go in for a hair trim.  I also use it for my cuticles if I give myself a manicure/pedicure at home. The only down side is that I have to be careful of using it with socks or getting into bed too soon after using it because it can leave stains on the socks/sheets. But if I wait long enough after using it to put on socks or get into bed then there are no stains. I also love that I live in the area where this product is made so I am supporting a local business.  I wish it was available at more nail salons!	2015-08-16

I started using the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system and realized how much whiter my teeth could be. It even whitened the edges on the top and bottom which my other toothpaste wasn't working on. The two step system only requires 2 minutes of brushing, which you should be doing already anyways, and is not messy like trays and whitening strips that take 30 minutes to work.  The toothpaste flavor is good too and doesn't burn or make my teeth sensitive. This is a product I can definitely recommend. The picture on top shows my before and the one on bottom is after using this system. You can see the edges of my teeth are much whiter in the bottom picture and my teeth are just whiter over all. I got to try this product for free as a Bzz agent thanks to Crest.	2015-08-16

Unfortunately that sheet included a tattoo I wanted to wear to a concert next week bc it looks like one that my favorite member in that band has. That was the reason I bought these and now I won't be able wear it. So I'm disappointed about that. All of the other sheets in the pack worked great though, they look amazing.	2015-08-16

Beauty	4	22	25	N	N	No white spot	The OZ NATURALS SPF 30 AGE BROAD SPECTRUM SUNSCREEN arrived safely and as scheduled.<br /><br />This SPF30 sunscreen contains 7.5% Octyl Methoxycinnamate and 7% Zinc Oxide as its active ingredients.  It is about 6.25 inches tall and lightly scented like most sunscreen does.<br /><br />When looking for cosmetic products, I always tries to avoid products that contains chemicals.  Many sunscreens out in the markets contains 2 to 3 different potentially toxic active ingredients.  Octyl Methoxycinnamate is one that can potentially be harmful to your body when exposed to UV rays;  it can generates free radicals in skin cells.  You can find this ingredients in sunscreens and lip balms.  7.5% is the max. FDA approved amount according to my quick internet search ( Please note I am not an expert or medical professional, please do not rely on this information and always do your own research).<br /><br />The direction is easy to follow, you simply apply it 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapply it every 2 hours/ 40 minutes after swimming.<br /><br />Overall, this product contained 1 chemical active ingredient instead of 2 or 3.  I appreciate that this product is MADE in the USA and is making steps into making less toxic sunscreen in the market.  I also uses a safer alternative active ingredient zinc oxide.  I rate this product 4 out of 5 Stars.<br /><br />*** I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Since I have never used this particular product before, I have nothing to compare it to (only reason I gave two stars) but as a long time Sally Hansen product user I highly suspect this product. First off, the crimped top of the bottle was cut off removing the expiration date. Second off, the lotion suspiciously smells like menthol, not lavender, and is not the quality I am used to in the Sally Hansen brand. Third off, when twisting the cap off for the first time, the bottle label cracked and peeled. So I am not sure if the product is simply old or completely fake. I am so disappointed since I love Sally Hansen products and very few stores carry them anymore. I was so happy to find Amazon offered a variety of this brand but now I will think again about ordering this product here. So sad.	2015-08-16

I liked it because it was effective and washed off easily with warm (soapy) water.  Unfortunately, it was discontinued so I had to renew my search.  I tried a few more before discovering this Veet Warm Sugar Wax Botanic Inspirations magic!<br /><br />This s#%t is rad!!!  First, and most Important, if you follow the instructions, it does a great job of removing hair.  Second, clean-up is a breeze.  Warm water is enough to wash it off your skin as well as the cloth strips.  Oh...and did I mention the cloth strips are WASHABLE and REUSABLE!  The other day, I waxed my chest and legs (I am a male) and though I needed almost 3 packages worth of the strips to get the job done, at the end, I threw them in the sink and soaked them in warm water and all the wax/hair rinsed out so I can use them all again (Let them dry before putting them away).  For that same chest/legs wax job, I only used one tub of wax.<br /><br />The temperature indicator, I feel, skews a bit to the safe side to keep people from burning themselves.  But personally, the &#34;No&#34; indicator was visible the entire time I was using it and I never got burned.  Going exactly by the instructions seemed to yield a thicker wax that was more difficult to spread so as the other reviewer indicated, go as warm as you can stand :)<br /><br />In summation, this is now my go-to product for waxing.	2015-08-16

They come in a sturdy metal tube, making it easy to travel with. The color of the 5 brush handles and the tube is pink. The bristles on the brushes are real firm and secure in the handles. This is of great quality for a good price. This would make a great gift to give your friends or you can pick up a few sets for yourself. I gave this 5 stars but it deserves more than that. I really like my set, they are so easy to use. Then I just pop the brushes in the container and throw it in my purse and off I go. I highly recommend this to everyone. You won't go wrong picking up a few.	2015-08-16

With a couple of curly-girls in the house, I'm always on the lookout for products to help tame their wild manes. I definitely prefer encouraging the spirals instead of the current trend of straightening it to within an inch of its life. This curl energizing therapy shampoo is one of several Tosca products we're trying together. All of them have a really nice scent. The shampoo lathers up nicely without being too harsh. I found that it truly does boost the curliness factor of your hair BUT I would highly recommend using the detangling and shine leave-in formula right after using this. (Or use another brand, my point is your curls are going to need plenty of moisture and shine after shampooing.)<br /><br />We love that it isn't tested on animals. It's a little expensive for the small size, but a little does go a long way. We will be keeping this on hand for curl rescue as the new school year begins!<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.	2015-08-16

My acupuncturist got this for me because I've been dealing with tons of thrush problems (yeast infection in the mouth, often caused by inhaled Corticosteroids aka inhalers). I brush every time I use my inhaler and use regular mouthwash, but it wasn't stopping the thrush invasion. I didn't have insurance at the time, so going to the regular doctor to get Diflucan or Nystatin or something was out of the question. It has worked for me twice now. The first time took a long while (it was pretty far along before we got this to work on it). This last time, I saw the little spots and tasted that strange taste in my mouth you get with thrush and started this immediately. Twice a day. - I can't stand washing with it for 2 minutes as it tells you to as the taste gets overwhelming. But I take my inhaler, brush my teeth and gently the roof of my mouth. Then rinse with water, rinse with this for about 15-20 seconds, and then rinse with Scope to kill this taste. Tiny bit of water in the front of mouth, avoiding the spots with thrush with the water, and then go about my day or night. - It's killed off the thrush in one week of use this time. All better!<br /><br />Should note, I also was told to use probiotic pills at the same time. As I take them on and off constantly, I can't testify to if this is due to a combo of this mouthwash and the probiotic pills or just the mouthwash. Either way, I'll take the win!<br /><br />It's a natural alternative to antibiotics and I'm thrilled to have something OTC I can use.	2015-08-16

I wanted to write a review for this product because I have used it for around 3-3.5 yrs and will stIill use it for other parts of my beastly body that needs to be maintainted lol.  It is strong, fairly quite, light weight, easy to use and clean. Its sharpness has just recently began to dull out, occasionally pull hairs, but I've had it for a long time and have never sharpened or properly maintained the blades so I'm surprised it lasted this long. I am very pleased to have purchased this product. And recommend anyone who is looking to maintain a short beard to grab one.  I do want to point out that I barley used the shaver side of the unit, I prefer rockin a beard. However, I have used it against my neck and it didn't shave close enough to not have to use a razor. To me that eliminates the purpose of the shaver. That's the only reason I rated it a 4/5. But the trimmer alone is worth the price for sure.  I'm happy to have bought this product, if it had longer length options, I wouldn't have purchased a new one. Thanks Phillips.	2015-08-16

Every so often, usually around Christmas, B&BW will release limited editions of their signature scents as parfum. These are slightly different, as they're interpretations of the original fragrance (a kind of sheer floral oriental with a musky vanilla base that is really something). The red glass bottle with black vines (Bath & Body Works Signature Collection Couture Limited Edition No. 3 Eau de Parfum Japanese Cherry Blossom) is heavier on the musky side, and lighter on the vanilla, and the vanilla isn't very sweet... so you get this very sexy, very warm fragrance that seems to kind of float in the air around you. Later versions (like the Ruby Red bottle, a red glass disc with gold Asian design) are sweeter and more vanilla focused; Still lovely, still fantastic, but not as dark and sexy as No. 3.<br /><br />As I write this review, there are 2 bottles for sale on Amazon starting at $150 each. I would love to buy them, but my husband would kill me for spending that much on something with an original price of $29. Sigh. But straight up, it's worth it.	2015-08-16

I didn't give them a 5 star bc who needs an eyebrow cleaner? I'd rather pay less and not get the cleaner or pay the same and not get a product I'll never use. The SmartBrow filler comes off easily with regular makeup remover. It takes a little practice to get the hang of using it but for people with really light eyebrows it's wonderful. I don't use the fine line filler bc I don't need it but if you do there are some really good YouTube vids on how to apply it. My eyebrows look great all day and SmartBrow doesn't smudge. The obvious fake penciled-in look is no more.	2015-08-16

I could see from the description that this mask by Drift To Sleep had all the features I required. As a result, I was eager to try it when the manufacturer contacted me offering a free sample in exchange for an honest review. Over the last five years, I’ve reviewed many different types and brands of eye masks, but I’ve always reverted back to using masks that have at least these four essential features:<br /><br />• It’s constructed of lightweight molded foam covered on the outside with a poly fabric;<br />• The foam contains large eyecups so my eyelids can blink or move (in REM sleep) without touching any part of the mask;<br />• The foam contains a cutout for the bridge of my nose so no light can seep in around my nose;<br />• It has an adjustable approximately three-quarter-inch-wide elastic strap.<br /><br />Without these four features, a mask will not work ideally for me to keep the light out and make me (mostly) forget that I’m wearing a sleep mask. Before I discovered that I needed these four features, I’d tried just about all the different type of eye masks there are. I probably have over two-dozen unused eye masks in my bedside table.<br /><br />What I like about this Drift To Sleep mask more than the current mask I was using (that one was a Good Night Sleep Mask purchased from Magellan’s, the travel goods company) is that this mask has a slightly thinner profile of foam around the eyecups. The eyecups are the same size on both brands, but the Drift To Sleep mask has a slightly slimmer frame of foam all around. As a result, there is less foam actually resting on my forehead and cheeks. It might seem like a small thing, but it makes a big difference, especially in the hot weather when the eye mask can become a bit too warm and actually cause the skin under the mask to sweat. The Drift To Sleep mask has the same advantage in the bridge-of-the-nose cutout. i.e., it is less bulky than the Magellan’s brand nose cup. Both shut the light out, but the Drift To Sleep mask shuts out the light with less foam touching the skin and therefore is more comfortable in warm weather.<br /><br />This is definitely the best sleep mask I’ve tried so far! I plan to use it from now on...unless, of course, I find another that I like even better. I’m hoping that some manufacturer will come up with flexible molded-eye-and-nose-pockets product that is lightweight and will allow for air circulation against the skin on hot nights.<br /><br />I know from past experience with these types of masks can occasionally be washed by hand and reused for at least 12 to 18 months. By then, you’ll probably want to get a new one because the foam will start to get old (and full of dead skin and face oils despite the washing) and the adhesive holding the fabric covering in place may have worn off in spots. Nothing lasts forever under daily use and to get one to two years out of an item like this seems appropriate to me. Silk eye masks can last a long time and they are very cool in summer, but they have no eyecups, which are essential.<br /><br />This sleep mask would make a nice small gift for any group holiday gift exchange party. In particular, it’s a nice idea to give the gift of a good night’s sleep; it is a gift that people will remember; and it comes in a lovely box that needs nothing but a bow to make it special.ame advantage in the bridge-of-the-nose cutout. i.e., it is less bulky than the Magellan’s brand nose cup.

There are so many glowing reviews on this, but I just wanted to add what I felt was significant after trying this oil for a month: Really does minimize stretch marks!  I am not new to oils, and have used (and DO use) other oils from Majestic Pure, however Rosehip Seed Oil was one that I had never tried. It is a lightweight, virtually odorless oil that is nice and light for the summer. My great interest in it was the claim that it reduces stretch marks, and I have some like that, (lines, etc) around my mouth and chin that I wanted to minimize. After a month of using this this oil exclusively, I find that it REALLY HAS minimized my mouth lines!  Not to any HUGE degree, like facial fillers would, but my skin around my mouth just looks smoother and the lines not as deep. I am thrilled with this product! Thank you Majestic Pure, you guys are an awesome company as well!	2015-08-16

It's made in Japan by hand and is quite different than American made Konjac Sponges (this info is on their website).  I've found American made ones to be too soft with a perfect cut.  The Japanese Konjac Sponge is still gentle, but more effective.  It's not created by a bunch of machines in a factory, so it doesn't have a perfect shape.  It's bigger, too.  It feels like it's made with more care and quality.  Even the string is much better quality.  I've had this one for a few weeks, and the string hasn't broken, and the sponge is still good as new.  As far as the type (meaning Cherry Blossom, Green Tea, Charcoal, etc) I can't tell a difference between them with any of the brands.	2015-08-16

Foot & Body Wash. 100% Natural Care & Defense Against Skin Irritation	Beauty	5	27	33	N	N	WOW! All I can say is WOW! Athlete's foot, bug bites, itchy skin, and horrible summer stank eradicated	This soap has VERY quickly become the go- to in our house. Summer is the perfect storm for just about everything that could possibly afflict you- itchy skin from bug bites and being outside, sweaty stinky feet, sweaty stinky everything else, and athlete's foot from public pools and water parks. We have used this soap to solve ALL of these problems! it contains natural antifungals without the disgusting smell of comparable products that are chock full of synthetics and chemicals. I love that this uses time tested natural essential oils to address these issues- and address them it does. Not only is it effective, but it's extremely cost effective. It's quite concentrated so a little goes a long way, I recommend using a shower poof and you'll only have to use a few drops! I have been very sick the last week and hygiene took something of a back seat when i was sweaty and fevery and miserable, Needless to say, when I came out of my whiny coma today I realized that I smelled AWFUL. I took a shower and was horrified to find myself STILL stinky! Seriously! So I used this and happily it completely removed my stench. Oleavine is my new best friend.<br /><br />If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate this as &#34;helpful&#34;.

Bought this at a store in person. First, out of all the brands at varying prices that ive owned, id say by far that i personally think Wahl is the best.<br /><br />As for this elite pro model in particular, i am very impressed. Its motor seems much stronger than other models, it cuts through my hair with little effort and no snagging. Other clippers ive had would snag my hair or my hair would pass through without being cut (i have straight thin hair).<br />I do like the metal tab at the back of the attachments since it seems to hold onto the clipper better than the plain plastic style, but i do not like that it does NOT include tapered ear attachments as ive used those with previous models to help give the area around my ears a cleaner look.<br /><br />From experience in owning a few of these just a tip, do not ever use any oil to lubricate the blades other than oil made specifically for hair clippers. Also, do not apply the oil directly from the bottle to the blades. The oil bottle comes sealed in a little bag with a small black brush, put just one or two drops of oil onto that brush and then brush the oil onto the blades with the clipper OFF, youre looking for just a very light coating. Then turn on the clipper and let it run for a few seconds with no attachments on it to help the oil lubricate the blades more evenly.	2015-08-16

Paraben Free Timeless Formula	Beauty	5	3	4	N	N	Hyaluronic acid and more!	I'm familiar with hyaluronic acid, because I've used several different brands in the past.  As a woman in my early thirties, I'm very focused on skincare, and I can vouch that hyaluronic acid is a GREAT addition to anyone's facial ritual.  This is definitely one of the best brands I've used.<br /><br />The way I apply it is first I was my face with cetaphil cleanser, next I apply a layer of this serum and let it soak in, then I finish with my nighttime moisturizer (I only use HA serum at night, personal choice).  Using it this way, HA evens out my skin tone and seems to work with the moisturizer, keeping my skin soft all day, and negating any dryness WITHOUT feeling greasy or oily.  Please note that this particular product has aloe in it, so I've found that it goes on a little sticky, which can be disconcerting.  No worries, though, just wait for your skin to soak it up, and all is well.<br /><br />My order also came with a sample of the most delicious smelling cleanser I've ever come across in my life (I'm being serious).  I'll probably end up ordering some in full size.<br /><br />(I received this serum at a discount, in exchange for my opinion and honest review of the product.)	2015-08-16

However, as a dryer it falls far short with very little blowing power and hot air.  It is not useful as a dryer, especially if you have a lot of hair.  To use this product, one needs to dry one's hair first and use it as a styler at the end of the drying process.  As styler, it works quite well.  The unit is light weight and it has a curl release button which keeps your hair from getting tangled up in the brush.  If you wish to have some extra fluff in your hair, this works well.  But for deep curls, a regular curler would work much better.	2015-08-16

I will change the review as time progresses, 37 year old female with bad genetics and suffering skin. I've done chemical peels & lasers at the doctors office. I'm happy to have something effective for home. I did it once. I did not test. I just went for it. I lasted about a minute and rinsed off in cool water and then moisturized and went to sleep. The following day when I was applying my face for the day I was STUNNED at how supple my face looked on the mirror and then I touched it and was equally as impressed. I'm already satisfied with my purchase!  It's been over a year since my last chemical peel however my face is used to this kind of thing and I STILL only did a minute and sat in front of the fan. It was definitely stinging immediately. When I washed it off it stopped. The next day I saw and felt nothing but good things- like I said supple and seemingly well hydrated! Use with caution and see incredible results. I can't not wait to see how much better my skin gets with time without having to go to the Dr, spend the  big bucks or suffer down time.	2015-08-16

Men or Women, with Peptides, Vitamin C, E, Hyaluronic Acid.	Beauty	5	14	16	N	N	Leave your face soft.	Prime Organix Anti Aging Moisturizer is simply my favorite moisturizer I have tried recently. It leaves my face amazingly soft and not greasy. I am very picky when it comes to skin care. I can't stand anything that makes my skin greasy or sticky. This was creamy  and rubs in great with a nice smooth soft finish.<br />I also love the packaging it comes in. I hate when creams are in tubes or bottles that you have to struggle to get the product from. Prime organix comes in a pump type bottle that guarantees you will get all of the product out without the waste.<br />Prime Organix  has a subtle scent that isn't very noticeable at first. I really like that since some scents tend to bother my skin. While I don't typically use a moisturizer daily since my skin type is on the oilier side, I have been using it daily in the summer since I am at the pool a lot and the sun and chlorine tend to dry out my face more. So I have been applying it at bedtime so that it can stay on my face overnight and help hydrate the sun damage. It seems to be working well. It leaves my face nice and soft the next morning.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-16

I'm on my second jar.  It is too greasy to use for daytime, but it is labeled as night cream, so I was expecting that (and I wanted a night cream).<br /><br />However, the consistency is not the same between jar 1 and jar 2.  The first jar was more greasy/oily cream, which I loved.  It wasn't greasy on my pillow case, and by morning it soaked up into my skin perfectly.  The second jar I received had a more creamy consistency--still the same night cream, I don't question that.. but it seemed thicker, less oily.  When I put it on it feels like it takes longer to sink in, and it sits there more mask like.  I feel like the second jar works okay, but the first jar worked better for me.  I saw better results with the first.<br /><br />I'm almost done with my 2nd jar, so we'll see what the third jar ends up like.<br />This night cream really plumps up the skin, hydrates, and gives a phenomenal glow! It doesn't cause breakouts, and doesn't leave a greasy mess on my pillow case.  If I skip using it for even 2-3 days, I can immediately see the difference in my skin's appearance and go back to using it.  It also doesn't have a heavy scent, which is nice.. a light one-yes, but not perfume scent, just a natural slightly honey like scent.	2015-08-16

I have very delicate skin and rosacea and this liquid has made a major impact and change in my skin. Not only has it toned down the redness but it also prevented breakouts and provided a nice glow. It has also softened my small amount of age lines and the eye cream has significantly reduced my bags and dark circles. There is n need to use more than twice a day which allows this bottle to last over a month. Be sure to syore out of the light and heat to prevent inactivating it. All together I would recommend this to any woman with any skin type.	2015-08-16

I just started waxing this past year and had been using the standard wax hair removal kits sold in the drug stores.  Decided to give sugar wax a try and am so glad I did.  I love this stuff!  I use it on my underarms and lower legs, and it works very well.  For the actual hair removal, I'd say it works about the same as the regular wax kits I had been using (the stuff you melt in the tub, not the strips), but I love this so much more because it is so ridiculously easy to use and clean up.  It's water-soluble, so any residue just easily washes/wipes away, and it's not drippy sticky like glue the way the regular wax is.<br /><br />You only get two wooden sticks with this kit and that's plenty because after you use one, you just run it under water to clean it for next time.  I bought a package of JMT Beauty Non-woven Waxing Strips to make sure I have plenty of strips on hand, and I'd recommend them as well.  They work perfectly with this sugar wax.  These are the products I plan to continue using for hair removal.	2015-08-16

I would not buy again and am debating sending the hair back. I put them in with micro beads, the more expensive brands only need 2 tracks, double wefted.. I had to fit as many as I could on my head so that it would slightly blend. The ends are thin on this hair just like other reviews have also stated. I am wondering if the good reviewers received better quality hair, or if they have just never used good hair before. I will never be able to wear these straight, I will always have to curl it so that the visible line of where my hair stops and the extensions continue is not noticeable. I have longer hair so it's pretty easy for extensions to blend with my hair.<br />I am leaving them in for a few days to make a decision on returning them.<br />Also, the hair does look nice in the package. But once you open it and unravel the hair you can tell the ends are thin. There was also a section on one of the wefts where the stitching was messed up, the hair was coming out in that spot, which I have posted a picture of.	2015-08-16

Beauty	5	1	2	N	N	I was amazed at the amount of peeling!	After a couple days of using this product as recommended, my feet started to peel, and continued to do so for the next 5 days. I was amazed at the amount of skin that came off. My skin even peeled between my toes and on top of my feet! By day 6 I still had a little peeling, but had softer, smoother feet. Before I did this peel, I was in  need of a pedicure, but not anymore! This is so much more convenient to do at home, and the results were actually way better than what I've gotten from salon pedicures. Just a few tips: When you apply the socks for the 60-90 minutes, make sure to put a pair of your own socks over them if you plan on getting up and walking around, because they are a little slippery. Also on about the second day my feet felt pretty dry, but resist the urge to apply lotion or oils so the peeling process can start. Also when you apply the prefilled socks, it helps a little to massage your feet so that the product can really soak in. I think this is a great product and I'm really impressed how much softer my skin is, just be patient because the peeling action doesn't really start until usually the third or fourth day. I did receive this item for free however all opinions are 100% my own.	2015-08-16

It’s called “Clean Comfort”.  It’s strong enough, but not overpowering.  The soap itself is very nice.  It’ glides across the skin easily.  It’s “creamy”, for lack of another way to explain it.  I’ve always liked Dove soap, but I really like it now that they make new varieties for men.  The only thing I can think of that would make me like it even better is if the bars were larger.  If they doubled the size, I’d be even happier.	2015-08-16

US	1999837	R1Y0MGQ0U4OKQ2	B0077PLNNE	861550425	Braun Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White	Beauty	4	6	7	N	N	Four Stars	When I received this product,  I was very excited to try it.  When I opened the box,  I got even more excited when I realized that it has a built-in light and the speed setting(two speed setting)  is very easy  to control.  I like how It clicks to the next speed,  instead of those slide buttons. It has 5 attachment heads,  a bag and a brush that is in perfect size to clean the attachment heads.  The attachment heads are supposed to help prevent broken skin and make the epilating experience less painful and intimidating. Each attachment head is for certain parts of the body; so before using this epilator,  be sure to read the manual carefully.This epilator is rechargeable which is great if your going away for the weekend and you want to pack light!  Now,  I have already tried it to remove facial hair,  leg hair and armpit hair, and let me tell you,  this is the best epilator I have ever used! When I used it on my face,  it definitely got rid of my mustache! (not that,  it was a lot,  but I get very conscious about it.  And the hair wasn't even long,  I can barely see it!) it left the top of my upper lip red but not irritated for only a few minutes. (I was actually worried that it was gonna stay red until the next day because I have very sensitive skin). The next day,  I used it on my leg using the attachment  that is specifically for the epilating the legs. I had to go really slow and against the hair growth because my leg hair isn't really that long. (leg hair and armpit hair needs to be at least,  half a centimeter to achieve best results.) it didn't really hurt,  the attachment head makes it less intimidating to use the epilator. Then I tried it on my armpit,  and Lo and behold! No broken skin! No bleeding,  no skin irritation,  not even any sign of redness!  I was very impressed!  I gave it a four star because the manual,  in my own opinion isn't very user friendly.  The drawings for the attachment heads are a little confusing.  I also had to read the manual every time I had to change the attachment head,  which to me is a little annoying,  but it was worth it! Overall,  this is a great epilator! Probably,  one of the best in the market! It's great for someone who will be using an epilator for the first time!	2015-08-16

Let's face it, nothing is going to reverse damage, BUT, what this product will do, is save your hair from breaking off more, at least buying you time to let it grow.

This is a brilliant conditioner for treated red hair. I was recommended this conditioner by my stylist/colorist, after he did an amazing job of putting reds and purples in my hair, and by using this with the matching shampoo--alternated with a combination of Aveda products (Color Conserve Shampoo and Madder Root Conditioner)--I've been able to maintain my color really well without my grey popping up nearly so fast. It's also summertime, when the sun has the best chance of messing up my color, and yet the Pureology Reviving Red shampoo & conditioner are working like a charm! The size is perfect for traveling (TSA-friendly!) and it's easily refillable because the travel size-bottle is just a straight pour one. Having this and the matching shampoo gives me the confidence to travel without worrying that the hotel conditioner will mess up my expensive color job!	2015-08-16

I am travelling in September and wanted to just bring a small, light diffuser for my naturally curly hair to use on the dryer at the hotel. It fits the bill for that purpose. It's not perfect, in trying to practice with it at home it regularly falls off the end of the dryer. It doesn't have the same nice airflow that my hard plastic one has so it takes longer. But it works. It does give a more concentrated diffuse if that makes sense. Overall will be fine for lighter packing and that was what I wanted it for.	2015-08-16

My hair has so much more volume and bounce to it and seems to catch the light better, giving my hair a depth of color and texture that it didn't have before with storebought conditioner.<br /><br />The scent is a really nice vanilla that doesn't stick around after the shower is over; your hair will be natural-smelling once it dries.<br /><br />A little bit goes a long way, I could see this bottle easily lasting months. It helps to use a wide-toothed comb in the shower to pull the product through your hair evenly. I will second the advice of other reviewers here to rinse with cold water!<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended product and seller.	2015-08-16

The earl grey lip balm smells so good & the body butter is great! It leaves my skin very silky! I bought this to try out the products before I purchased full sizes and I plan to buy the full sized body butter now. It does feel a little greasy at first but I put the body butter on at night and when I wake up my skin is very smooth & soft. It also stays that way much longer than other lotions/body butter I've used in the past. I haven't had a chance to use the shampoo or conditioner yet, but so far I've been happy with the products. I should also mention the body butter does have a noticeable smell, I don't LOVE it, but for as well as it's worked I don't mind.

Its kind of weird. First off let me say I purchased this from Ulta only to find it here on Amazon for nearly half if  not more of the cost as i found it at Ulta and debated whether or not i would return it. I ended up keeping it and boy has it worked. I’ve always had a sleeping problem and as I write this have been up for 24 hours. I should have unsightly raccoon eyes but I don't!!!  I think its kind of funny to be honest lol. It looks like my under eyes don't want to be bags or become bags. It almost looks like I can see the product fighting the bags from coming on. I must say I am really pleased with the product thus far and am glad I decided to get this from an authorized dealer to make sure I get the right thing. I can also say that my fine lines have improved also. I’m seriously shocked because I haven’t been using it am and pm, just in the pm right before bed, in hopes to have money on this expensive product. I will continue to use this. After one week of usage I can see why this is the number 1 skin care line in Europe.	2015-08-16

We bought it from a Food Lion that was near by us, but one day it wasn't there anymore. It wasn't anywhere we looked not in the beauty supplies or drugstores. We all forgot the name of this product. All we remembered was that it was a green jar and it worked really well for our type 4 hair. I did some intense searching and finally found this product here. But it's still not in any of the stores we go to and we don't know what happened. I think they should put it back in stores because it really slicked down our edges. We all love it. Personally my edges don't lay flat with this gel by itself, so i tie it down with a scarf. Good luck. [...].	2015-08-16

Did this for a few more nights, and then they were totally gone.  Wanted to get rid of them especially before we went on vacation.

I haven't used dye since high school and I wanted something that was going to last longer than the crap I used back then. I have been impressed so far. I bleached my hair first to a light blonde. I then used the product undiluted and rinsed with cold water. I washed it the next day (I usually don't but we finally got the oil tank filled and I couldn't resist a hot shower). The color has stayed very well so far. The color is true to the picture for the product I received.<br /><br />Beware this stuff is POWERFUL. I was very careful but I could see how this could ruin some floors and bathtubs. I got some on my worst above where my glove was when I was rinsing my hair and it stained my skin.

My hair is very thick and pretty healthy. My hair length is touching my shoulders, so I just wanted a little more length. This was the perfect match for my hair color - medium to dark auburn and looked very shiny and healthy hair. The first time putting in my hair was a little hard, but by the third time putting it in, I was pretty good. It just takes some practice and adjusting the clips. I think it was well worth the investment and I would definitely purchase again.	2015-08-16

Steel Slant Tip Eyebrow Tweezer from Petunia Skincare are AMAZING! from Petfrom Petunia is AMAZING	These Stainless Steel Slant Tip Eyebrow Tweezer from Petunia Skincare are AMAZING! from Petfrom Petunia is AMAZING!!!!  This tweezer is everything I have ever hoped for in tweezers!  It is heavier and larger than any other tweezer I have owned, but still fits nicely in my hand.  I have spent a lot of money on tweezers over the years and it always sucks when I get home, excited to pluck and the dang things do not work!  It's like there is a gap somewhere and it just will not grab a hair, or 5 for that matter.  We have all had that disappointing moment, I am sure!  Well, THIS IS NOT THAT TWEEZER!  This on will get the job done, whether you need it to pluck hair or pull out a splinter (yes, I have already had to use these for that).  Being made out of stainless steel, I believe these will last a very long time (if they don't, I will update my review).  The sharp slant is great and helps to separate the stray hairs from the ones that are in place.  I received this Stainless Steel Slant Tip Eyebrow Tweezer from Petunia Skincare for FREE in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion.	2015-08-16

After a few applications you will learn the perfect way to apply on hair. It is best if you use multiple mirrors while applying to you can apply as evenly as possible. Or you can just give it to your Barber and have them apply once your done getting your haircut. I have had a single application last several days, the main thing to do is wear a stocking cap at night and in the morning just very lightly sprinkle some hair illusion and you will be back to normal. I personally would apply fresh everyday it has the most authentic look with a fresh application. Takes about 10 minutes to apply and that's being real particular about everything.

I had a hard time finding some to match my hair color. I have natural medium brown hair with a little red hue to it, and I have high lights of medium to light blonde done monthly with low lights every other month. I looked a long time for extensions that best matches my highlight color but they all looked either too chunky, too light, or too dark. I had my hair darkened a lite last time and when I ran across these extensions, they looked like they would match the best out of all the ones I've seen that weren't priced too high. I bought them for $7 and it said they would arrive in almost two months so I was pleasantly surprised to have them arrive after two weeks! They were very VERY long-- I had to cut a lot off because my hair is fairly short (barely shoulder length) and the length difference was ridiculous. Down side is the hair is almost like Barbie doll hair-- it's really shiny. And it doesn't curl AT ALL, major bummer because I think curling extensions make them blend better. No weird smell though. Also came already on the clips. One pack was a little thin for my liking but it's working for now. I'm gonna order another pack. The color wasn't a perfect match but close enough. For a first time user I was pretty pleased but they tangle super easily and they shed when your brush or comb them out to be careful not to play with them while they're in. All in all worth the money and will buy again as well as recommend to others. Included before/after pics.	2015-08-16

I was happy that it came with a small funnel to transfer the perfume (I'm sure I would have wasted half of my fragrance trying to pour it directly into that narrow opening otherwise).<br />I don't like the top and cap as much as the bottle itself, as they are plain and the metal doesn't appear to be of very good quality...but as long as they fit tightly, that is okay (and I can't really complain--my expensive perfume was saved!)	2015-08-16

This wig is an absolutely fabulous wig! I ordered it to come quickly and it did and it was exactly what I ordered, it's very realistic only I need to get wig glue to keep the sideburns area down but that's just me needing to get more material. It sheds a bit but it's an extremely full wig so I'm not too upset about it, the curls are gorgeous although she does tangle. It's easier to untangle finger combing or with a wide tooth comb so again, not a big deal, and as odd as it sounds, I like the way it frizzes slightly because it looks like real hair, that can be tamed of course but it doesn't look like a tangled wig on your head it looks like hair.

I hope these are helpful to you!<br /><br />~ Fragrance: Very faint, lotiony<br />~ Color and texture: White, medium to thick lotion<br />~ Feel during application: Smooth and thick, spreads nicely<br />~ Feel after absorption: Moister, cool, not oily or sticky<br />~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Fine for all. Not sure I would use it on an oily face.<br />~ Is it tested on animals?: No<br />~ Packaging: 1.7oz white plastic pump bottle. Pump offers reasonably good control.<br />~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Dry skin looks moistened.<br />~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Definitely better than using an ordinary lotion without active ingredients. MSM, vitamin C, and vitamin B5 are good things to have. The moisturizing oils are palm oil, safflower oil, shea butter, and jojoba oil. The formula isn't anything to write home about but it's good for your skin.<br />~ Other notes: This listing on amazon is for 3.4oz; I got half that, a 1.7oz container. At 1.7oz this is priced like a treatment cream that should have a lot more in terms of active ingredients, but it's more like a moisture lotion with a few extras. If I'd actually gotten the amount advertised, I would consider this a four-star product because the price would be more in line with what you get. Instead, it's a poor value and false advertising.<br /><br />*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don't when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it's more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.<br /><br />As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

I have to get a new deodorant because my faithful favorite for YEARS has recently stopped working as well. I bought this one last night because I thought the smell was tolerable and it looked all right. I put it on after my shower last night, and I guess it reacted with dead skin or something? Because clumps of dead skin mixed with deodorant got EVERYWHERE after about a minute of it being on (including my clothes, and it WOULDN'T COME OUT!!). The smell? Not tolerable. I have a really sensitive nose, and strong scents really bother me, ESPECIALLY if they're attached to my person. And then, I put it on this morning, and not two hours later I'm already beginning to smell bad. This deodorant is NOT for me. (To be fair, I've been sweating a LOT, but even my old deodorant that isn't working as well does a better job than this stinky stuff.)	2015-08-16

Here's my two cents:<br /><br />The Good: I have almost always used the traditional rotary electric razors, which I had found gave me a better, closer shave. I was wary about the special foils and the 4-way shaving system; it seemed at first too much like another Gillette-esque gimmick. However, after shaving several times with the Braun Series 9, I must confess that I have found that not only does it truly pick up those difficult hairs on the first pass, it also excels in reaching those difficult areas like the chin and neck; this is a big deal for me! Also, the foils are easily removed for quick cleaning, and the trimmer mechanism is clean and convenient.<br /><br />The Neutral: The cleaning station. While a neat feature (essentially what it does is bathe the foils in an alcohol solution for cleaning and disinfecting) it's not something I would pay the extra bucks for--a quick rinse every so often has always worked great for me. As long as I'm the only one using it, I don't feel a need for deep cleaning.<br /><br />The Bad: The Braun Series 9 is not travel size. It is certainly the largest electric shaver I've ever owned--it does come with a nice zip up travel case though. If you plan on using it exclusively at home, this is obviously not an issue. Also, the lock for adjusting the head angle is right at the spot where you put your thumb when you hold it, and it too easily comes unlocked while you shave, allowing the head to move around too much.	2015-08-16

Was slightly irritating at 1st but I used it with Murads anti acne anti aging serum (which makes the biggest difference in my acne-if I run out of that serum I breakout). I used this wash and that serum with Clinique's rosacea cream to calm the irritation at 1st and that worked well :)<br /><br /> For more serious adult acne & anti aging you could switch out that Murad serum for a prescription retinol from a dermatologist. I didn't give this wash 5 stars because the company has been asked by safe cosmetics advocates to replace a few ingredients. Unfortunately there is not natural BPO washes to my knowledge :(	2015-08-16

I loved that is was silky on one side and velvety on the other so I could choose which side to have near my face. I like the velvety when its cold outside. The lavendar puts pressure on your eyelids and helps keep your eyes closed while sleeping.

I love that it's an all natural herbal shampoo that doesn't contain parabens, or sulfates. I have never in my life seen a bottle of shampoo that contained such simple ingredients including coconut oil, lavender, rosemary, sage, rose petal, aloe and calendula extracts, organic honey, soya protein and DM water... Nothing else!!<br /><br />I received 4 bottles of Vaadi Shampoo each weighing almost 4oz (3.87oz). They don't take up valuable space in my shower and are easy to travel with. I have included product pictures for reference.<br /><br />Two years ago I had highlights that fried my hair. My once thick, long, glorious head of hair has since fallen out and thinned leaving me with a disaster in comparison. Since I've started using my Lavender Rosemary Shampoo I'm noticing a new shine and more moisture in my hair. It has become easier to manage and feel healthier, not to mention my hair smells amazing!!<br /><br />The lather is rich, although not as rich as shampoos full of chemicals... It's the chemicals that make a soapy lather. For a natural shampoo it has exceeded my expectations. It leaves my hair feeling naturally clean and the shampoo is gentle enough to use on my children. I appreciate being able to pronounce the ingredients and that they are ingredients I am familiar with. Disclaimer: I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. Regardless, I'm very pleased with the overall quality and the results I'm seeing with the Vaadi Lavender Rosemary Shampoo and would happily purchase.	2015-08-16

I was worried about the product at first because I typically breakout from makeup, but i haven't broken out once. The powder lays on nice and it does not irritate my skin. I'm so happy with my purchase and the arrival time! It is also fresh and it wasn't broken when it arrived!<br /><br />(UPDATE)<br /><br />I have used the powder Contour Pallet and absolutely loved it, so I did not have doubts about the Cream Contour.<br /><br />Frequently, I face irritation and acne from make up products. That is just how my face works. It is hard for me to find make up that doesn't cause irritation, rashes or acne.<br /><br />However, there are times where I can find make up that works and DOES NOT cause me any problems. This is one of those products.<br /><br />This product DOES NOT cause irritation. It is extremely comfortable to wear.<br />This product DOES NOT cause acne (For me at least) which is rare.<br />The cream goes on smooth. It does NOT clump and it does not stick.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone looking for a GREAT contour cream.	2015-08-16

Then i went outside and i started sweating immediately.  I decided to try again the next day because that day it was 92 degrees.  I was thinking there isn't a deodorant that'll completely stop you from sweating so I'll try again.  It gets really hot in my room so I don't know if that was the case, but I'm getting ready to go out for the day.  I spray it on, sit down for a few minutes and i can see sweat rolling down my arms like literally drops of sweat so i sprayed more and more and then one more time.  I ended up blow drying it so it could dry hoping that would help it get working.  I went out that day, 80 degrees and again still sweating like crazy.  Halfway down my sides.  It didnt work.

However, I did purchase the Andalou Probiotic Renewal Cream, the Purple Night Cream, and the Enlighten Serum on this site.  Ever since I started using the facial products, I began breaking out and purchased this because it was a good price and my health food store was offering it at 20% one day.  It works ok on some breakouts, but not others.  This does not make a pimple disappear in four hours as I believe I saw it mention.  Blemishes take a couple of days to start fading and others take up to a week.  I was so excited to find this line which is non-GMO and the ingredients seem really clean.  All together I've been really disappointed in the products, as well as this one.	2015-08-16

My feet were horrible. I love to go barefoot any time I can and you could tell. My heels were dry, cracked deeply, sore to walk on and the skin was so hard that I barely had any feeling in them. I had to rub my feet in coconut oil any time I went out in public because the dry, cracked skin was so embarrassing. Lotions, creams, files, lavender oil - nothing hid the damage for more than an hour or two.  Baby Foot has made my feet look BRAND NEW.<br /><br />- I did soak before using it & soak for 15 minutes every day after. No lotions or oils.<br />- Day 1 - 3 my feet just looked dry - the skin looked kind of like tissue paper, worse than usual. I was scared I'd ruined them. But on day 4 the peeling started. Small patches at first, but the more I soaked - the more skin fell off.<br />- You WILL have a lot of dead skin to deal with. It will go everywhere! I wore socks at all times so I didn't leave a trail of skin around the house.<br />- The tops of my feet & ankles did peel, but not until the last 2 days.<br />- By day 11 I was finished and I have never been happier! No more cracks, my heels are soft and pink again. Even my toes look better.<br />- There are a few small areas that could use a bit more help because they still FEEL a little rough even though they look great, so I may do a second application in a few weeks.<br /><br />This product is fantastic!! I've been telling all my friends about it.	2015-08-16

I was very excited that mine came in the blue which ironically matches my living room.  The plug which is not attached so that about every 3 used you wipe the fluid base out with a soft cotton or tissue easily,  then Plug it in and enjoy.<br />So Allay breaks the oil up into millions of particles so that there is no condonsation and can be placed on any surface , so there is no worry it will ruin your furniture.<br />The Allay has 3 settings, on with color, on with no color and off.  The smell will envelop you into relaxation and infuse your home with a beautiful smell, I have enjoyed the Allay Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil since I recorded it and with using it I have felt so much better, and in a more relaxed frame of mind.  Essential Oils can really change your mood.<br />I'm so very happy that I had  the opportunity to try this product, it has really changed the way I feel & wanted to take the time to let you know how enjoyable it is so you can also have the opportunity to try it as well.	2015-08-16

Im giving it 4 stars because anything that requires daily use sucks, but, you gotta do what you gotta do...I prefer this minoxidil over the liquid brand because it does not contain propylene glycol...  Propylene Glycol makes my scalp itch, alot..  So the liquid version seems to do more damage than good..  Some people complain about the foams inability to make contact with the scalp, I have a little trick for you guys..  Fill up a cup of hot water, fill the minoxidil cap halfway with the foam, submerse the cap in the water, not to the point where water fills the cap..  After about 20 seconds the foam will liquify, then use a medicine dropper to apply the minoxidil directly to the scalp...  :)<br /><br />Now onto the reason why this product does not work for some people..  Minoxidil is not a hair loss product, it is a hair growth product! It's actual mechanism of action is to &#34;open channels&#34; in the scalp allowing more blood and oxygen to the follicle...  Thats all it does..  If you have a terrible diet and live a terrible life, this product will send &#34;terrible&#34; blood to your scalp.. Making your hairloss worse...<br /><br />So, before you decide to use any type of minoxidil you should take a good hard look at you diet and lifestyle..  Excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, fast food and a sedentary lifestyle will typically make this product ineffective..<br /><br />Some helpful hints to make this product more effective...<br />limit alcohol consumption to once a week..<br />smoke cigarettes only when you drink..<br />adopt a paleo diet..<br />take a zinc supplement, 50 mg a day works for me..<br />use a ketoconazole shampoo a few times a week..<br />a multivitamin will help, just don't overdo it..  Less is more when it comes to multivitamins..<br />get some exercise, it will help cleanse your body of all the crap..<br /><br />Once you fix the &#34;inside&#34; you can fix the &#34;outside&#34;..  Hope this info helps.. Good luck!lps.. Good luck!	2015-08-16

It cleans the hair thoroughly without stripping and provides conditioning although I wouldn't call it deep conditioning.

These brushes are really nice! They are firm, but soft to the touch, and easy to grip. The side pouch is really good for storing the brushes (I have my unused ones in there), or small makeup supplies (like blush, eyeshadow or brozer).<br /><br />I have used them for contouring, eyebrow defining, and finishing powder, and they have been doing a nice job. Another use is that I have been using the other end of the small angle brush (eyebrow brush) to cleanup my cuticles after painting my nails, and it makes it really easy. Brush cleanup is super quick, just a little soap and water.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like is that the largest brush loop is too large for the brush, so I have to store that either in the bag, or lay it with my other makeup products.<br /><br />* I received a discount in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-16

During the first 4 applications I was fine. My face was a little red when I washed it off but quickly faded. With the 5th application, which was the fullest strength, it burned my face and I had marks and severe redness for a week. I had no idea it was burning my face because it didn't give a burning feeling. When I removed it with the water, I discovered the burn marks. The following morning my face was in pain.<br /><br />I hopped online to find a quick remedy and had already had a lotion that was suggested for burns. I used that along with some vitamin E and lavender oil (which is a antiseptic and promotes skin rejuvenation) to keep my face moisturized enough to keep from blistering. Luckily a few days into it I happened to have a doctors appointment and she ended up giving me a prescription cream that is for fading scars, which was why I was using the peel. I discovered the cream was also good for burns so I continued using that and within 3 more days I was healed up.<br /><br />In that 10 weeks of applications I didn't see any difference in my marks, or my skin appearance in general. I know it takes a while to work show a difference but considering the 5 times I used it used about half the bottle, the money wasn't worth it. The cream I have been using was about the same price (not covered by my insurance). I have been using twice a day for 2 weeks, with no side effects and have already noticed significant fading of my scars.

Full Body Moisturizing Souffle Creme with Sea Kelp, Avocado Butter, Vitamins & Antioxidants, and Aloe	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	I thought this Body Butter was light, and a pleasant Earthy Scent.	I find the Ednae Body body Renaissance Souffle cream to be a very pleasant earthy vitamin infused aroma.  I like that it's more of a thick body butter, than a lotion.  I can pick out the notes of Mango, and Aloe the most.  I like when my body butters do more than just smell good.  I liked how soft my skin felt, and I like when products have ingredients like Sea Kelp, and Avocados too.  I found it to be a nice fluffy mixture that went on easily, and my skin absorbed it well.  I am glad it has an earthy, light, scent.  I wear scents that I can smell when my skin heats up, not scents that others can smell rooms away.  I think that's what I liked more about this Body body, the light feeling on the skin, and the light scent.  I received product for free for my opinion.	2015-08-16

I haven't had it long enough to see if it's durable but it did come with argan oil which was a nice bonus and  I do like the glove they provide with it as it's longer (so covers my wrist) than most gloves you get with heating tools.  It's pretty standard, I do find it a little bit harder to use for curling hair than straightening (I used to use &#34;Hai&#34; straightener for curling my hair which I loved but they broke every year).

I tend to apply it and go on to do other things so sometimes I leave it on for 20 minutes and no issues whatsoever and if anything maybe extra benefits.	2015-08-16

I am 62 and many say I look 5-10 years younger.  Keeping my skin hydrated, drinking water, and staying out of the sun for long periods has also helped.

The downsides are it take at least half and hour to absorb into the skin so you'll probably look ghost face for the duration (maybe I'm just applying too much).

They work well. The three longer ones are made of a hollow plastic, so they are very light. I prefer a heavier brush so I simply added alittle molding clay just above the brush at the metal part.<br />The red ended (NO.1) brush is 6 3/4&#34; long w/ the bristles, The bristles are 1/2&#34; long. The green ended (NO.2) brush is 7&#34; long w/the bristles, the bristles are 3/4&#34; long. And the blue ended (NO.3) brush is 7&#34; long w/bristles, the bristles are 1&#34; in length.<br />These 1, 2 & 3 brushes are strip brushes. For making lines, feathers  whatever comes to mind with these brushes.<br />The other three have wooden handles. Two measuring 5 1/2&#34; long, w/bristles, the bristles are 1/2&#34; long & 1/4&#34; long. The third brush w/bristles is 5 1/4&#34; long , the bristlesare 1/16&#34; long.<br />These three brushes I use for flowers, clouds, grass , these short bristles could paint many things on your nails. I paint birds, trees , leaves. These brushes are small yet big in punch. They hold nail polishes & acrylic paints very well, and are really easy to clean. I haven't lost any bristles from them either.<br />They came with clear plastic open ended covers , but they don't stay on very well, unless firmly pushing them down onto the handles. I just don't use them, I store my nail brushes in a vinyl baggie, open end so they get air. Bristles face up.<br />These brushes haven't disappointed me so far.<br />'THANKS FOR READING, '	2015-08-16

So I use this product a little differently, I actually use it on my thigh/butt area. I have been lifting heavier weights lately and noticed some great gains…the only downside is the stretch marks that come along with them. Therefore, I decided try this out and attempt to “elasticize my thighs.” So far I have noticed that my previous stretch marks have faded slightly and I don’t seem to be gaining any new ones!!:) It has a wonderful fresh and fruity scent, and I always get excited to put it on after my shower. This caviar absorbs quickly and leaves my skin very soft and silky. The ingredients are amazing and I am positive I am going to use this when I get pregnant as well! I would recommend consistent use for best results. 5 stars from me!:)	2015-08-16

I got this because I have felt my hair start tinning and failing a lot. I believe due to stress and age. My hair is constantly breaking. The products and shampoos I have bought are not very helpful at all. Deciding to get these pills had been good results.  Now I really don't see any growth at all. But I have notice that my hair is thicker and stronger. There is less hair on my brush and and while I shower I don't lose much hair anymore. I believe the vitamins and ingridents have started to help me.  I will continue to use and update about the growth. Other than that I can start to see great results from my hair being dull to becoming more thick and shinny. Easy to use and easy to drink. Not huge pills and I can swallow easy. No bad aftertaste.

I understand that oxygen tubing varies in diameter and in flow rating (some are up to 5 or 5 liters per minute and some are up to 15 liters per minute for example). Why is there nothing mentioned in the description anywhere about flow rate? To me it's an important -i.e. vital piece of information. I'm currently using 15 liters per minute and will soon be needing a bit more than that even. Back pressure on the smaller volume (standard) tubing fouls up the concentrator and doesn't allow it to get to 15 lpm. I've got some tubing marked &#34;high flow&#34; that will allow it all to work together and provide me with 17 lmp at the cannula end of the line.

I do not dye my own hair, so this could be lack of experience, but it seemed crazy that lake water would cause it to fade the way it did.	2015-08-16

It's traumatic realizing one needs to use a devise after one's prostate is surgically removed. It takes practice to use this device, and it's about a 30 min. set up time.  Certainly doesn't contribute to the right spontaneous mood. And the ring (which does hurt to a certain degree) has to be removed and cleaned up within a 30 minute time span.  However, it does work, and one does get pleasure as long as all your nerves haven't been cut.  Definitely worth trying.	2015-08-16

With this two step whitening process I have seen my teeth change about one shade whiter, which for me is great since other products have never seemed to really work with all of the hassle that you go through. This product is simple and easy, it's just brushing your teeth. I will say that after using the deep cleaning toothpaste your teeth will feel rough but when you continue and use the second tube of whitener your teeth will feel great.

I have also discovered that I love using this for more than just cleaning. I love adding it to my oil blends, and the scent is strong but not overpowering.	2015-08-16

It brings the impurities to the skin surface so it is easy to extract them. I wouldn't get this if you have very dry skin, as it really pulls the skin pretty taught when you have it on. I don't leave it on long as it would be very over drying.	2015-08-16

What can I really say about a toothbrush, they're pretty straightforward. I chose this one because it's (mostly) plastic free.

Unfortunately, I found this to be too powerful for me, which can be good if you want a daily cleaning like you're at your dentist's office. But for me, I don't like holding objects for long that have strong, intense vibrations, and two minutes can seem like a lifetime when something is uncomfortable.<br /><br />Despite the top brushes of the head being bent somewhat due to shipping (the plastic was pushed in), the brush itself was comfortable, and easy to remove for replacing.  I can't say the same for the battery compartment, which says to turn and pull, but it's hard to turn a rectangular piece. The batteries themselves seemed slick, which makes me wonder how secure the compartment is from moisture, and worries me that the brush won't last long.<br /><br />The tootpaste itself tastes more like baking soda than mint, but at least it leaves the mouth feeling clean. Overall, I was not as thrilled with this as I hoped. If you are well used to electric toothbrushes or intense, rough cleanings, you'll likely have a better experience. For me, though, it was a little too much.	2015-08-16

This one, I made 6 little jars of body butter and I should have put more essential oils to cover the smell. Maybe it is just mine that is like that?<br /><br /> It came in a nice container, all clean...but the product is not what I expected. Also, they forgot to write &#34;8 oz&#34; on the label. When you are making cosmetics, it's very important to know how much you are using. I had to wash my hands, and check it out on Amazon website. I won't buy or use this brand again. Hopefully, I will have more luck with the other brand (Village Shea Butter) that I just purchased because I can't find the african one I used to buy anymore.	2015-08-16

Leaves hair lightweight, shiney, bouncy and soft while protecting the color of your hair.	Fantastic shampoo and Conditioner. Even though I bleach my hair and color it blue or purple every other week my hair still gets greasy. So I have always stayed away from color safe shampoo made for colored hair because it would weigh it down and only stay clean for a day!<br /><br />I have used it 3 times now and have had minimal fade in my bright purple hair. I might actually be able to go 5 more extra days without coloring it again because the fadding in my hair color is minimal.<br /><br />My hair is soft, bouncy, lightweight and shiney. Not to mention the shampoo and conditioner smell sublime. Even my husband walked up to me and sniffed my head and said, &#34;wow your hair smells really good!&#34; I guess he kept walking past me and couldn't figure out if I was wearing a new lotion or perfume and was shocked that it was the shampoo and conditioner I used.<br /><br />I would highly reccomend this product to anyone who colors their hair ANY color, weather your color is Natural or a Fun color.  One thing I did notice is it takes a little more shampoo or product to use in your hair.  The shampoo and conditioner instantly absorb into your wet hair, so to get a good lather note that you will need a little more shampoo than you normally use. The conditioner is great too, it does not feel greasy so I added a little extra in my hair as well because without that traditional greasy feeling I was not sure if I added enough. So i again used a little more than I normally do. After I dried my hair, it felt as good as the Kevin Murphy and other expensive products my hair stylist uses.<br /><br />I am definitely going to purchase more in the future. Great packaging and fast shipping!	2015-08-16

Originally it was purchased for my hubby but I decided what the heck I will give it a go. I have used numerous kinds of acne face wash and nothing really seemed to help. ProActive was good while it lasted, but after about 2 months the acne seemed to evolve and again I was breaking out constantly. The other ones I have tried are your basic drug store brands so I won't bother to go into much detail on those.<br /><br />Now this stuff. I wanted to give it a full 5 stars but overall it doesn't combat my acne fully (it does do a decent job, though). What it does do, however, is make my skin softer, more radiant and it is minimizing my pores. Heck, I even just bought their pore minimizing serum so we'll see how that goes. This face wash feels so good when you put it on. The little bean exfoliate beads inside of it really do their job and if you rub softly they don't irritate your skin at all (so if you want to really grind up your skin, just rub hard.).<br /><br />Letting it sit for the full minute is hit or miss. It is pretty strong in comparison to other face washes. The first time I let it sit the tops of my apple cheeks started to burn and I got a-scurred and quickly washed it off. The second time, a few days later, was much better but still it starts to really make your skin feel icy-burny shortly into sitting. I really like the feeling though, and I think it only irritated my skin because of how large my pores were at the time.<br /><br />My hubby likes it and his skin looks pretty dang clear, much more so than mine. It smells good and I like how easily it goes on. It doesn't foam up (much?) and sits nicely on your face. I could say it is comparable to St. Ive's Exfoliate face washes, but more creamy. It also seems to penetrate deeper thus giving you a better clean.<br /><br />Now keep in mind your face will be tight after using this. Not much of an expert on facey-things but I assume this is one of those face washes you need a moisturizer after. I suggest a light essential oil type as they are less greasy than creams.<br /><br />So in a nutshell this is a 4.5 out of 5 product for me. If my acne condition improves I will up it to a full 5 stars. My hubby on the other hand, would give it a full 5.ssential oil type as they are less greasy than creams.<br /><br />So in a nutshell this is a 4.5 out of 5 product for me.

So, I am basing this rating on comparisons to other natural deodorants, not &#34;unnatural&#34; deodorants. I'm doing this because there just isn't a comparison between natural brands and other brands. Natural brands just don't work as well.<br /><br />So, with that said, Herban Cowboy is my favorite. I've found that it requires less applications Han other natural deodorants. It also smells much better. I've found other natural deodorants tend to smell like body odor mixed with natural scents... It's just weird. Herban Cowboy does not do this. It retains a good scent, so long as you reapply often.<br /><br />Even though I do like this brand, I no longer wear any deodorants. Although, I do keep a stick of this in my closet just in case.	2015-08-16

Put on in shower, comb through, step out of shower and WA LA..you are done. I am a wash and wear kinda girl. Never use any heat on my hair. And I am old. Pushing 68 hard. And I have great long blonde hair. TRESemme. An incredibly undervalued product.	2015-08-16

Would not recommend getting this beard trimmer. The battery life is extremely bad. You have to plug it in for &#34;14 hours&#34; for it to be used for a decent amount of time. However, when the trimmer is not plugged into an electrical socket, it will lose its power in 1-2 days. The only decent thing about the trimmer is that it has numerous adjustable increments in the lower length end. I really think this is a cheap product with subpar materials and quality, and I think investing in a more expensive beard trimmer with better durability and quality is well worth it.	2015-08-16

I had my hair bleached blonde for over summer, and my stylist was supposed to just darken my hair closer to my natural hair color--medium soft brown. She turned my hair jet black and when I asked her to fix it, she put little high lights in my jet black hair. Two days have passed and today I used two boxes of color oops in my hair. I followed the directions and used for only 20 mins. The next thing it says is to rinse and repeat. Ladies and gentlemen, please actually do that! It makes all the difference. My hair looks so beautiful, the jet black hair is gone! What is here is some of my highlights and my medium brown hair with the slightest hint of red. I think what is important is not to wait longer than 72 hours to put the product on and to actually take the time to follow the directions.	2015-08-16

Nice stand with some heft to it, the craftsmanship seems very good, solid, and the bottom has some soft material so it does not scratch or move from where you set it down on your sink counter. I have one of the Muehle R89 Razors which this stand was designed to hold,  I do not believe it will hold other razors as it holds the razor upside down and takes advantage of how the razor handle was designed specifically the razor handle's neck to do this. It seems the stand will work for other brushes than those made by Muehle.  I am using a Dovo Silvertip Badger Brush with Micarta handle with the sand without any problem, and will hold other brushes with the standard wide base. All in all I am very pleased with the stand and its construction, it feels like quality piece and would buy it again.	2015-08-16

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Very useful, does the job well	In my work, I am constantly reviewing the customer service of the company I work for. Last year, I had a few problems when my boss questioned me about some notes I had taken on a few employees, it was as if he didn't believe me. Because I can't pull my phone out when I'm doing my job, I searched for something else. This pen camera is perfect, and very non conspicuous. It allows me to record for just the right length of time, before I go and upload the video to my computer. I now have proper documentation, should my boss ever doubt that my notes are incorrect. I am very glad this product exists, it has made me work life a lot easier with less headaches!	2015-08-16

I will use this 2 or 3 days in a row, and then exfoliate and/or go back to another lotion/cream or nothing at all.  Be wary when you have a fresh mani/pedi because depending on the top coat this may cause it to go dull.  Also may cause certain clothing to discolor.  But otherwise, this helped with acne on my back, what i think might be kp on my shoulders, and seems to enhance any moisturization i do on the following days, which is nice in the winter.  In the summer when i might not want to wear lotion every day, this makes additional lotion seem unnecessary.	2015-08-16

I tried this for the first time yesterday and was very impressed.  I am a woman in my late 20s and have always had a problem with sweating and underarm odor.  I have tried degree, secret, dove, Mitchum, and arrid, all kinds and all strengths.  i usually sweat within an hour of starting work at my office job.  The odor sticks to my shirts so that I have to wash them twice (tmi but I wanted to give you an idea).  I wore this yesterday, I was a bridesmaid in a wedding.  I put it on and let it dry (it goes on a little thick) and it lasted through the ceremony, outdoor pics in 95 degree weather and the reception.  It says 72 hour protection but I began to sweat minimally with no odor about 10 hours after one application, that with the thick texture is why I didn't give it the full five stars.  I will continue to use this stuff.	2015-08-16

I originally bought this to go with the lactic acid serum. I was fine during all stages of the serum except the last one when I was at full strength at which point it burned my face. It took a week to heal and I didn't notice any scar fading at all...but I know it takes a while to work. More effort than it was worth in my opinion. I have stopped using it and have gone to a prescribed ointment for my scarring in lieu of the chemical peel route. It was the same price as one bottle of the serum but I use it twice a day with no nasty side effects to my skin and in 2 weeks, I have noticed a substantial difference in the scarring. BUT, I found another great use for this brush.<br /><br />When my skin is really dry, I will use this to do an oil cleaning routine on my face. I pour some almond, avocado, or vitamin E oil (the Jason brand is GMO free and has almond and avo oils in it) into a small dish and use the brush to spread it on evenly, just like I would have done with the chemical peel serum. I used to do it with a cotton ball but kept finding the cotton getting stuck to my face, especially around my eyes, which was not pleasant.	2015-08-16

US	51793127	R7ON8X3JM10EY	B00WX4XPM6	893255911	Sandalwood Natural Soap Bar with Shea Butter 5oz	Beauty	5	5	7	N	N	It's Soap: I Wasn't Expecting Much ... But I Was Pleasantly Surprised!	Gotta be honest: as a guy – a traditional, middle class red-blooded male – there are things in life I just take for granted.  For example, soap is soap is soap.  Right?  I mean, sure, there are different brands with different cleaning formulas and different names and ingredients, right?  You get in the shower, and you reach for whatever bar is there, and you wash yourself off, but it’s honestly a product I haven’t invested all that much time, effort, and thought into.<br /><br />So when I was asked to review a bar from Soap.Club, I really didn’t quite know what to expect.  I mean I knew my world probably wasn’t going to be rocked, and I figured the Heavens weren’t going to fall down around my ankles.  Like I said above, it’s soap … right?  How different can it be from the last soap I used?  (Again, you’ll have to pardon my man-ness.)<br /><br />Still, this Sandalwood Soother surprised me.  Right out of the box, I sniffed it, and I honestly didn’t much notice a scent or an odor all that different from the soap I had used the day before.  You know what I mean?  It has that soapy, clean smell but there’s a hint of something more in there.  My nose perhaps isn’t as learned enough as the next to notice any significant difference … but it wasn’t until actually using it for a few days in the shower that I started to appreciate what Soap.Club’s product is all about.<br /><br />The bar actually lathers up quite nicely, giving off a wonderful head of bubbles; and the feel of the soap on my arms and whatnot was a touch more like the good oils used by my licensed massage therapist.  As for the sandalwood scent, it’s definitely not anything overpowering, but it’s strong enough to hang on to the skin with a pronounced hint after drying off.  Certainly, that’s a nice extra as I live in the Great American Southwest where temperatures just yesterday were 117 … so any extra deodorizing effect from any product is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest aftereffect to using this bar from Soap.Club I experienced is that – unlike many store-bought alternatives – my skin doesn’t feel dry or cracked or tight once I’ve sponged off the water and even an hour or so after cleaning.  My experience is that many soaps have a tendency to dry out the skin, giving me that kinda/sorta parched feeling as the day wears on, but that definitely isn’t the case with this Sandalwood bar.<br /><br />So I’ll definitely keep using this, and – when it’s done – I’ll quite possibly be picking up another one so long as my skin continues to feel the way it does in the weeks ahead.  Watch this space, and I’ll update should it become necessary.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Gotta be honest: it isn’t all that often I get excited over personal hygiene products of this nature (I honestly haven’t reviewed all that many, and – as a man – I probably tend like most to take certain things for granted when it comes to cleaning up), but I loved the quality and fragrance of this Sandalwood Soother from Soap.Club.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Soap.Club provided me with sample testing product of their Sandalwood Soother (Bar) by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.Perhaps the greatest aftereffect to using this bar from Soap.Club I experienced is that – unlike many store-bought alternatives – my skin doesn’t feel dry or cracked or tight once I’ve sponged off the water and even an hour or so after cleaning.  My experience is that many soaps have a tendency to dry out the skin, giving me that kinda/sorta parched feeling as the day wears on, but that definitely isn’t the case with this Sandalwood bar.<br /><br />So I’ll definitely keep using this, and – when it’s done – I’ll quite possibly be picking up another one so long as my skin continues to feel the way it does in the weeks ahead.

It's a load of fun. I have tried almost every product out on the market with little or no success. I have been using Sea Buckthorn oil for awhile and am astounded at the rate at which my face has cleared up. I use this twice a day after washing my face. I can go almost the entire day without my face getting oily and my face is feeling so much better. I have sensitive skin so I was a little unsure about trying this at first. I have had no issues with reactions, other than super positive ones. Unlike a lot of the products that have that medicine or chemical smell, this really smells great. I highly recommend this for anyone that has skin issues.<br /><br />I received this free in exchange for my honest opinion.	2015-08-16

This shampoo has absolutely no preservatives.Preservatives and other chemicals cause me to have skin rashes and other allergic reactions. The shampoo contains honey, green tea and some other ingredients that seem to help my hair. My hair is the thin, frizzy, fly-away kind. It was originally very dark brown, but is now graying. Since I started using this shampoo my hair has a fuller texture. The colors also seem stronger, deeper. The shampoo, not runny, more like a cream, lathers well in the hard water at my home. The reason I did not give this product a rating of five stars is that the bottom of the bottle is curved. Every time I pressed down on the plunger of the applicator, the bottle slid off the shelf in the shower. I took out the plunger part and replaced it with a snap top cap.	2015-08-16

Does clear skin problems like pimples, not greasy and leaves  you feeling very clean.  My dog had what I thought maybe the beginning of a mange outbreak, I washed her with the sulfur soap twice, not rinsing it off the 2nd time, drying her with a towel.  I put insecticide in her bedding and areas she roams. She no longer has the problem.  (Though I would take efforts to prevent dog from licking it off,  had some strange urine and stool from her during the couple days afterward) I recommend highly these soaps as they definitely  were effective against issues I been struggling with for several years.	2015-08-16

No, they still don't heal acne, but if I've expressed a pimple (because I can't stop myself), these hydrocolloid dots provide a moist healing environment.  My picked-at pimple will heal faster and won't get a dry scab, reducing any scarring.  I get acne on my chest and shoulders in the summer for some reason, and these dots help hide the red blemish, and they blend in well.  They work great on most of my face and for the most part aren't very noticeable, but I will say that near my chin and mouth where my skin has a lot of movement from me talking and smiling, the dots will wrinkle at the edges, making them very noticeable, so do keep that in mind.<br /><br />I did try the Nexcare brand of acne dots, and those have raised edges that are noticeable, and they also don't stay on well at all - each morning I'd wake up to find the acne dot had come off and was somewhere in the bedsheets or had restuck onto me elsewhere.  These Cover-Dots don't have that problem at all, they stay on for 48 hours or more.  Very happy with these Cover-Dots from SMARTMED.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Do these dots make my acne disappear?  No.  I can wear these for 24 hours and they stay in place despite my oily skin, but they don't make my acne go away, or suck out pus from an unpopped zit (ew, sorry I'm mentioning it) or anything.  If a zit has been popped it does help the area stay clean so I'm not dabbing with a tissue every 2 minutes, and helps it heal that way.  It also keeps me from picking at acne (which is a big problem for me) which is the main reason I use these.<br /><br />It's best to remove them after washing your face with warm water, it helps loosen the adhesive of the dot.  I don't have any experience trying to cover these with makeup, as I just wear them around the house.<br /><br />So, an &#34;acne cure&#34;?  Not for me.  But it keeps me from picking at my face and that's a good thing (I'm my own worst enemy).rom picking at my face and that's a good thing (I'm my own worst enemy).	2015-08-16

For younger kids, an all-in-one product (including body wash) is a bit easier.  Currently we've been using the Honest all-in-one cleanser which smells like a creamsicle and is more natural.  However that product is significantly more expensive.  If you're looking for a good value and a shampoo/conditioner combo that gets the job done, this shampoo & conditioner will do just fine.  I slightly prefer this scent and my 5 year old slightly prefers the more 'tropical&#34; smelling Suave 2-in-1 that we've used in the past.	2015-08-16

Beauty	3	1	28	N	Y	Okay, but miss the zesty smell of citrus!	To be fair, I have only used the OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser for a few days so far, however was really disappointed with the fragrance.  I was hoping for at least a hint of natural orange or lemon but instead it has an almost medicinal smell ..... not overwhelming, just not in the least bit citrusy.  I also don't like the fact that it can't be used to clean off eye make-up since it will have a stinging effect.  I was aware of that problem when I ordered, Just didn't think it would be such a big deal to have to use 2 different products to clean my face, but it kind of is.  Hopefully upon using the product for a greater length of time, the pros will outweigh the cons on this cleanser. For now, I will just rate it as being &#34;okay&#34;.	2015-08-16

I bought these after trying on a number of insoles in the store, to fit within sneakers used primarily to play Squash.  Since there is really no way to know how they'll feel in real use, I figured why not go more material-conscious if they feel more/less equivalent in the store.<br /><br />After just a few uses, I started to feel pain and some bruising in the inner metatarsal (big inner) bone.  After a while, I estimated that the angle of the pad created too much additional stress toward the front, as the back have very thick cushion and very little at the front (which seems not to be uncommon with 'athletic' innersoles).  So I had to remove them after limited use, and have noticed the inflammation subside.<br /><br />I can't say this will happen to everyone's feet of course -- and the review is for strenuous use with a lot of forceful striding -- but for me these innersoles were a counterproductive expenditure of money.	2015-08-16

A great brush at a very good price.  Unlike others of this style that I've tried, right out of the package, the Diane duster did NOT lose hairs...and it seems to be keeping them.  Only four stars because the duster top is a little heavy and the base is a little light, sometimes allowing it to tip over if it's not carefully placed on the counter.  The hairs of the brush are slightly crimped which give the brush a bit more backbone than some others I've tried.  It makes brushing hair off the cape quick and easy.  When used on clients' faces, ears, and necks, use a little bit lighter pressure to keep it comfortable and let the brush do the work.	2015-08-16

You stray it on and a few hours it's gone.<br />Plus the smell of this perfume is the all that! I got fooled by the title; Heat Wild Orchid&#34; that title<br />sounds like it would smell like something out of this world.Or something I have never smell before.<br />A rare sent, something very unique, but it's not just an average scent, that fads away very quickly.	2015-08-16

I usually tweezers them but it takes forever. This epilator hurts as much as tweezers but the difference is that it is faster. It saves time and it is like ripping a bandaid off quickly, way more tolerable than the painstakingly slow alternative. It comes with 2 different heads, one for smaller areas like underarms and one for larger areas like legs. I personally don't like shaving because my hair grows back the next day. By pulling the root of the hairs out, this last much longer  (2-4 weeks). It comes with a cooling spray that I really liked. This isn't loud, my husband could hear it right outside the bathroom door but not much farther. I like that it is a plug in item instead of battery ran because I usually can't find a battery to save my life. My husband likes to hoard the batteries for his game controllers lol. It also has 2 speeds and is super easy to clean. After using this epilator, my skin was a little irritated and red. It goes away on its own in about a day but I would suggest putting lotion or aloe vera on it. For longer hairs, you'd have to trim them down before you use it. Likewise, you cannot use this on super short hair because the epilator cannot grab the hair. Overall I'm thankful for this product making my life do much easier. I have added a video of my review so you can see this baby in action! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-16

This smells funky. Like very funky. It smells weird at first then it gets a hint of lemon but still smells weird. I still haven’t gotten use to it. With that said, this cleanses well. It rinses clean and doesn’t leave my face feeling dry. The bits and pieces in it don’t seem to scratch or irritate my face. It leaves my face a little glowy and really clean. Unfortunately this is on the higher pH and is an 8. Too high for me to be comfortable using. The skin has a pH of 5.5 so I don't like using anything over 6. The jar itself is really nice, but the label came off after a couple of weeks of use. If this had a lower pH and smelled differently I would definitely continue using it.<br /><br />This comes in a clear glass jar with a gold screw on lid. The label has product information. This is a dark brown almost waxy formula. It has black bits of coffee in it. It smells… I don’t know how to describe the smell, it’s a bit waxy/musty/musky/lemony smelling.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />African black soap, shea butter, African coffee, fragrance.<br /><br />I was sent this to try in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-16

I purchased this razor as I was looking for an alternative to my Merkur Futur razor. Don't get me wrong I like the Merkur Futur I have had it for 6yrs now and its still going strong but I was looking for something a little bit lighter which the R89 Twist is by about 1oz  (120gm vs 90gm) and I was looking for a thinner head so that I can maneuver the razor around the bottom of my nose mustache area easier which this razor does very well. I like the adjustability of the Futur but have come to the conclusion that having an adjustable razor it is not necessary unless you have particular skin issues, etc which require you to adjust the razor to avoid aggravating your skin. This razor is not adjustable, but seems setup to give a close non-aggressive shave which I like, and the handle has a good diameter, and is knurled to give you a positive grip.  The razor feels very well balanced in the hand. The quality of the razor seems great the twist mechanism is precise, no rattle in the handle or head, the lockup of head to handle and blade alignment are perfect. In short it gives the impression of a high quality precision tool, I would definitely buy this one again.	2015-08-16

As much as you can expect, this can only &#34;control&#34; your oil so much. Or rather, at least it doesn't add to what your face already makes. Some of us have very oily faces even after 4-5 hours.

Beauty	5	4	5	N	N	Soothing for Eczema	As a sufferer of eczema I have heard nothing but wonderful things about Evening Primrose Oil.  I have a few other products from Plant Therapy so I thought it would be the perfect brand to get the Evening Primrose oil from.  I have had this oil for about 5 days now and I have found wonderful things to do with it besides helping with my eczema.  This Plant Therapy Evening Primrose Oil comes in a plastic bottle with a snap lid.  It is a nice size bottle with 4 ounces of product.<br /><br />Evening Primrose oil is the oil from the seed of the evening primrose plant.  Evening Primrose Oil is a carrier oil so it can be used alone directly onto the skin or essential oils can be added to it to enhance its versatility.  After a shower I use the primrose oil with a few drops of tea tree oil as well.  This combination is very soothing to my dry, sometimes red, patchy skin.  This mixture could also be used on the hair to combat dandruff.  The primrose and tea tree oil does wonders for my eczema and even only after a few days I am noticing that my skin is not as dry.  I will continue on with this regimen and hope that it works well into the winter when my skin gets hit the most because of the weather.  This a good product and I am happy that I decided to try it.<br /><br />I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.	2015-08-16

I got this for my grandma because she is always talking about how Hyaluronic Acid is amazing so I got this for her so she can try it on and check for herself how it works. After she used it I can already see the difference and an improvement on her fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness under her eyes. I am really surprised. It is very important that it has No Fragrance & Parabens because our skin is very sensible. I am happy with the combination of the ingredients in this product.

As so many know it is important to take care of ourSelves.  Because of the hole in the ozone layer and the cruel rays of the sun our skin is very susceptible to all sorts of happenings..dark spots, age spots, freckles, melasma and hyperpigmentati.  Whether we are women or men our skin is the same and the sun does what it does regardless of who we are!  Yes, i am vain about my looks so i checked out some of the products that can be used to help correct the effects of the sun and came across a small family run business  called Protege (i am not a fan of big companies at all!) who are in Blaine, Washington.  I purchased their product called Luminate and am amazed at how it has lightened my skin and got rid of the dark spots on my hands and  chest and pigmentation at the side of my face.    I just wanted to share this with you in case you too are as particular as I am about your looks...and I know there are many beautiful women and men who are my friends.

Clinique is the only makeup I buy, so when I found this deal, I snatched it up!  I LOVE all of their products, but the quickliner for eyes is one of my most favorite products.  The liner is so easy to apply (no hard pencil ends, etc.).  Just twist and more liner appears.  It's a very soft liner and will come off with soap and water.  I don't use the smudge tip, so I cannot tell you how it works.  I just use the liner and LOVE it.  I also love the quickliner for brows, so if you have the opportunity to grab it, do so!!!  I've been wearing Clinique for 20+ years and have never had a problem with any of their products!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

It had been a long hot day so I took responsibility, apologized, and blamed me spacing out and wandering into her lane on my Multiple Sclerosis (MS). After a smile and a trade of a peasantry or two the subject of age came up. I don't remember how or why, but she guessed my age at about fifty, FIFTY! Now, I'm old, but come on! That's when I started looking for a way to, maybe not look &#34;younger&#34; but at least my age!<br /><br />I told everyone who would listen that I didn't wanna go under the knife, but I desperately needed a solution to my problem. VITAMIN C SERUM by Defy Naturals sent me a sample in return for sharing my honest opinion about the product, and I have to say it was my miracle!	2015-08-16

I love my new cosmetic brushes because they look so nice and professional. These brushes are soft, thick and would work perfect with liquid or powder foundation. I have ordered the silver and white set and they look awesome. The 10 brushes can be used for the following: Round Blending Brush (Powder Foundation), Angled Blending Brush (Foundation around Your nose and mouth), Flat Blending Brush (Foundation around Your nose and mouth), Tapered Contouring Brush (Conceal around Your eyes and nose), Angled Contouring Brush (Blush and Bronzer), Small Tapered Contouring Brush (Conceal on rounded areas like Your nose), Small Flat Blending Brush (Conceal under eyes and around Your nose), Small Round Blending Brush (eye shadow and primer), Small Angled Contouring Brush (Contouring hollows of cheek and sides of Your nose) and the Small Angled Blending Brush (Stipple conceal and blemishes). These brushes can cover all my needs and more when applying my makeup. The bristles are non-porous, that is great to prevent skin infections and to keep the bristles cleaner. The brushes feel very soft and silky on the skin. The set comes with 10 brushes and a Delicate Pink Bag with logo iLoveCos. I did not receive the pink bag, reason why I am only giving 4 stars to the product. I would recommend these brushes to my friends and family.

I use it to dress up and pretend I have long hair. it is smooth and shiny and comes with a cap for your head. I don't use the cap. I trimmed the bangs just a little too short but I can push it forward on my head and it looks good. The ends seem to tangle a bit, but if you hang it on a head rack it will probably be fine. Delivery was prompt . I would give it a five star but I am new with wigs and do not have anything to compare it with. I assume that the real hair wigs are much more like a five star.	2015-08-16

I also love that I feel comfortable using on my 5 year old daughter due to it being formadelhyde and toluene free.  Her favorite color is Liberty which is a pretty blue.	2015-08-16

I like that this pack of no tangle hair brushes comes with a smaller version of itself but has the same Bristle Length.  I thought the colors were very playful, and my 4 year old claimed the smaller brush instantly.  I have a sensitive scalp, and I felt like the brushes bristles were massaging my head.  They are not hard, or too stiff.  I felt like they had give to them, that way getting a knot out felt easy to do instead of getting stuck in my hair.  I also noticed the brushes are covered in like a soft silicone feel that was nice to touch.  I also liked that the smaller brush has a thicker handle, so it was easier to hold when brushing.  I appreciate little details like that.  I received product at discount for my opinion.	2015-08-16

Anti-aging?  Uh, no.	Update:    I took photos before commencing this trial, and photos after using the this kit for two weeks.  I used photos to try to limit the placebo effect and make the comparison more objective.  I see no discernible difference between the before and after photos.    Original review:  This serum and cream duo are advertised as anti-aging.  For the price you pay, you get 1 Tablespoon of the serum and 2 Tablespoons of the cream.  For the price, I would expect it to be more than just a moisturizer.  I have used many, many less expensive anti-aging moisturizers, because like everyone else would rather look 25 than decades older.  However, as one dermatologist said, &#34;none of these products actually works&#34; or she (50-ish) would look 22, which of course she didn't.  The product comes in an elegant box with two pump bottles, and a pamphlet.  The pamphlet instructs you how to massage your face.  There are no instructions on how to use the product, but on the Amazon site there is further information.  You are supposed to use the cream in the morning.  In the evening, use the serum, followed by the cream.  The Phyto 5 serum is said to &#34;fill wrinkles from the inside&#34; and to &#34;provide restoration, protection and much needed hydration.&#34;  The cream is said to be &#34;rich in anti-aging molecules, hydrates, firms and restructures your skin.&#34;  After using the duo for a week, I can attest that it does a half decent job moisturizing my face.  I have not noticed any firming, or restructuring however, nor age defying results.  I have to call it a failure in its primary mission, given that no one would consider paying this price if it were advertised solely as a moisturizer.  I will continue to use it because it claims to be a three week treatment, and will update if I notice anything new.  Otherwise, when this product is gone, I will return to using my more economical current favorite &#34;anti-aging&#34; moisturizer.	2015-08-16

First of all, the customer service from Serumtologie is AMAZING!  Shortly after purchasing the product I received an email from Vanessa, the co-founder of the company and then several weeks after beginning usage I received a second &#34;check-in&#34; email to see how I liked the product and provide tips for not only using the product but maximizing my skin care routine!  I have purchased a LOT through Amazon over the years and this is THE FIRST TIME a company has actually contacted me personally to ensure I was happy with their product.<br /><br />Now on to the most important part, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I began using Serum 22 the morning after it arrived and have used it every day since without fail (about 3 weeks at this posting).  I absolutely love the feel of this product on my skin. I have oily skin, aging skin AND I live in Florida which has tremendously high humidity so my skin, regardless of how well I try to take care of it, suffers from a fairly constant presence of some type of imperfection - usually nothing major - small bumps or breakouts - but rarely flawless.  After incorporating this product into my routine for several weeks, I now look in the mirror and see radiant (not oily) skin!  My pores are significantly less noticeable and my skin is well on its way to actually being flawless for the first time since I can remember.  I noticed that I don't need as much cover-up and on many days I can actually get away with a light dusting of powder and be on my way!  Honestly, were in not for the fact that my skin gets so oily in this humidity, I probably could actually go WITHOUT make-up for the first time in FOREVER.<br /><br />This product is well on it's way to becoming a holy grail product for me and, for me, the customer service only seals the deal! Bravo Serumtologie!	2015-08-16

I have tried numerous aluminum free deodorants over the past couple of months to find the best one for me. This was really works the best. I've tried Trader Joe's (the worst), a roll on mineral, Tom's, and Schmidt's (burns and gave me bumps). The Lavanila doesn't burn, I don't get bumps, the scents are great (I've tried coconut/vanilla and vanilla), the application is smooth and not messy. It wipes on like a regular stick deodorant. It is very white when you first put it on. So you need to rub your armpits together until the white goes away if you plan on wearing a sleeveless shirt. Once the white is rubbed around, I have found that I can even wear a black sleeveless without it marking. My search is over and I am sticking with this one. It is very expensive I think though, with aluminum deodorants only being a few bucks, but worth it to not put aluminum into your system. Hence the 4 stars on the high price. I'd like to see a men's version with a manly smell, for the guys.	2015-08-16

They are no more special than most other sunglasses.  And today, my second pair broke while trying to clean them. Cheap plastic.  Though they were not expensive, I expected more durability.  I simply wore them everyday without abusing them.  As someone else said in another review, they look like they are toy sunglasses when you first see them.<br />Will not be ordering these again.	2015-08-16

I ordered this perfume bottle in a pinch...needed to decant one of my fragrances with a leaking bulb atomizer and no other cap, so I needed something and needed it fast. It turned out to be surprisingly difficult to find an appropriate bottle (lots of them were tiny or just held a small amount; others were fancy but had reviews mentioning that the embellishments actually leached into the perfume, ruining it--I guess those were for looks only, not for actual use) so I ended up ordering several and hoping for the best. This one worked out perfectly--large size, a simple design with deep grooves that makes it easy to hold without slipping; not too fancy, but looks nice and, most importantly, it can hold a lot!--plus it came with a small plastic funnel that made transferring the perfume quick and easy. The spray top and cap seem pretty utilitarian but they seem to fit tight and as long as they prevent the contents from evaporating, I will be happy.	2015-08-16

For people who are using this for the first time, make sure you test it on your hand first before you use it (just in case it feels uncomfortable). I used 1 part clay and 1/2 ACV and 1/2 water. I kept this on for about 15 minutes and it felt so weird! When you keep it on for a long time it will tighten your face into the center and you will feel pulsing on your face. When you wash it off though, it feels amazing!! I suffer from acne and I have a lot of acne scarring. I heard from many people that this can help with both. Also, this comes in a tub that will last a long long time.	2015-08-16

I bought this bare bones model through Amazon for about $35.  I couldn't be happier with its performance.  I can feel it is helping relieve my gingivitis after only one month of use.  For me, it will pay itself off in reduced dental cleanings bills almost immediately.  I highly recommend this product if you have gum problems.  I've been flossing once day for years prior, but nothing to date has helped my inflamed/bleeding and receding gums like this toothbrush.	2015-08-16

This is the first matte lip color I have ever purchased. I have never seen an applicator like this one. The lipstick appears through tiny holes in the top of the tube. You can apply just the amount you want to a lipstick brush. I like the fact that it's not a stick of wax  that can be broken or come out of the cap and get on everything in the bottom of my purse. I always use a lip brush even for gloss and this gives me a lot more control over the amount of color I am applying. Matte lip color should be applied with a brush. That way you can build on the amount of color. The is a beautiful true red color. Reds that have a lot of pink in them will make your teeth look yellow and with my coloring, blonde hair, green eyes and fair complexion orangey reds are unflattering. This is a perfect red.	2015-08-16

It seemed like what it was promising was too good to be true.  But, I think it might actually work.  I’ve lost a lot of weight, but my arms are still really flabby with a lot of loose skin.  I applied the gel to my right arm only for several days.  Even my husband noticed that the one arm was visibly better than the other.  Granted, it’s not a miracle, and my arms have a long, long way to go, but there is definite improvement. In general, the gel is easy to apply.  For me, it has a cooling sensation that is not at all unpleasant.  I like to think of the cool tingle as a way to know it’s working.  It does have a strong scent that lasts several hours.  But, it’s definitely not an ‘old person cream’ smell.  And, I’ll be applying the gel to both arms and hoping they both get better.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.	2015-08-16

These are amazing. I have thinning hair due to over processing with relaxers & coloring over the years. After transitioning to natural hair the past 7 months it's hard to not miss straight flat hair when your on the go days in a row. Well, I tried these on my now thickened new growth(African American), it flattens it perfectly. I lost my mind I went on a &#34;Hey kids who wants their hair flattened?&#34;, spree. Comes with a 5ml bottle of Argan Oil leave in treatment & one safety heat glove. Also a coupon for future products. My guy niece came to visit in state & tried it. She's a fresh out of college sisterhood showcase hair type girl and she raved about these. We got her a pair for a going away present. She loves them, thanks me all the time. My brother's fiancé used them & only had loads of positive comments & people she's a hair stylist. Please take the time to invest in these. I used them at the highest temp(which I do not recommend for all hair types) 410F and it did not burn my hair at all. Side note my letters are starting to rub off due to the amount of oils or moisturizers I use whenevet I break them out. But oh so I can't say it enough, oh so worth it.	2015-08-16

It doesn't turn you orange like most self tanners. I would recommend always using the medium color rather than the fair no matter what your skin complexion is. There really is no difference. The only thing you need to watch for is your knees and elbows because they can start to look dark. I usually put it on the first day that skip that part for the next 2 days. I also recommend buying the face product and not to use this on your face. This is a great alternative to going to the tanning salon and much safer.	2015-08-16

Is more psychological than the product itself, because you think you are attracting the opposite sex, makes you more confident and that self-assured makes you sexier. But is not the smell! This is a simple math, easy to test with the opposite sex in an open conversation, ask your sisters or brothers someone that it won’t have any interest in you, and ask them is the smell makes them fill attracted to you. Now that I know the fragrance I smell it anywhere. I think that I’m going to change business; this is like taking a child a candy. This product is not worth it for the price; I won’t pay more than $10.00 as a simple regular perfume, nothing else. If need this to makes you more confident, buy it.	2015-08-16

Another great oil from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  Before I start the review of this five-star product, I wanted to mention a common problem: Once you start diffusing, you can't stop!  If you are reading this, then you probably know what I am talking about.  I am a beginner, and Plant Therapy's line of moderately priced Essential Oils has been a great introduction to diffusing that has allowed me to experiment with High-Quality 100% natural products.  Their Basil (Linalool CT) is no different.<br /><br />Basil essential oil has limitless uses. And while the many benefits have been discussed at length in other review, I purchased Basil specifically to use in a diffuser during the winter months, as Organic Facts indicates...<br />&#34;Illness: Basil essential oil is effective in providing relief from colds, influenza and associated fevers. Due to its antispasmodic nature, it is frequently used to treat symptoms of whooping cough.<br />Respiratory: Along with its function in relieving coughs, it can also be used to treat asthma, bronchitis, and sinus infections.&#34;<br /><br />Although this oil smells somewhat like the culinary basil scent that we are all familiar with, the scent is more complex. At the heart there is the basil(part of the mint family) essence. Additionally, there are subtle notes that some may perceive as citrus, woodsy, mint.  All of these combine for a rare and complex oil for diffusing and another fiver-star product from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  [Note: It won't make you home smell like an Italian Restaurant!] Having tested several products in this category,<br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-16

We use this on our 5 year old daughters hair to help keep it detangled.  It's recommended to use on dry hair before you wash it (i.e. why it's called a pre-wash), the downside of this is you're putting a lotion like substance in your hair which is a bit odd.  Would be nicer if it could be sprayed, or had a different applicator other than it just being in a tub.<br /><br />It has a pleasant smell and does work well, helping keep hair detangled and softens it as well.	2015-08-16

However, they won't send me a new razor without sending the old one in.  Given that this is a product I use daily, and is not a cheap razor that has had major issues within a year, this is not ideal.  I asked if they could put a hold on my credit card and send me a new razor preemptively, and then remove the charge when they got the broken one, and they said they could not.<br /><br />In summary - poor display failed under a year, and customer service won't make my life easier.

MULTI-BOND Coconut Oil, Sunflower, Sea Buckthorn LARGE 118ml	Beauty	5	5	7	N	N	Fights frizz. Refreshes styling products. Gives skin a healthy glow.	I am completely obsessed with this product! It has worked wonders for both my skin and my hair. I am plagued with a dry, itchy scalp. My hair is naturally wavy and tends to frizz no matter what. This product, however, is wonderful. After washing my hair, I spray it close to my scalp and then all over, using my fingers to spread the product through my hair. After blow drying, my hair feels sleek and smooth, yet not greasy like I've experienced with other products. It also helps to provide moisture to my scalp and keep the itching at bay.<br /><br />I also love using this product to reactivate my styling aids. In the middle of a humid day, my hair will often start to frizz. I can spritz this product throughout my hair and smooth everything back out. It doesn't add weight to my hair or give a sticky feel. It just dries beautifully and makes my hair look just-styled.<br /><br />In addition to using this product for my hair, I've also been using it as a facial mist. It's refreshing! I spray it on my face after washing, after applying makeup, or even when my makeup just needs a little freshen up in the middle of the day. It give a youthful, dewy glow. Because it's a light mist, there is also no issue with it causing my makeup to cake.<br /><br />This product provides a wide variety of nutrients that are essential to both skin and hair, including Biotin. It is also free of harsh chemicals. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient, multi-purpose solution to dry skin, dry hair, and frizz.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discount by the seller in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-16

This is a tougher review for me because it is a good mascara but due to my eye shape and sparse eyelashes I felt like it was harder to apply.  The way the brush is shaped and the watery formula makes it hard to not make a mess when I apply.  I liked the color and how it gave a more natural look once dried.  It doesn't look clumpy and it feels light on your lashes but I do feel like if I wanted a more dramatic look I would have to use a different mascara.  So I'm mixed on this one but it was recommended by many beauty bloggers I follow so it might just be personal preference for me.	2015-08-16

The woman at the all natural store in my town said that the badger brand was very popular and similar to the California baby super sensitive. LIES. I've used it three times and have just come on Amazon right now to order another bottle of the California baby, and figured I'd take a minute to voice my opinion on this one. The first thing I noticed was the greasiness. Oh how I hate greasy sunscreens, and both of my fair haired children burned the few times I used this. The problem being that it is so greasy it never actually rubs in very well. So as soon as your child rubs against something or wipes their face...bye bye sunscreen. If you're reading this...trust me. Buy the California baby super sensitive and try that first. You'll never need to look for another sunscreen again.	2015-08-16

When I saw this one in the store recently I was super excited - &#34;they brought it back!&#34; I thought. Unfortunately this is a completely different product than their old one and basically does the exact opposite of what they claim.<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it is LOADED with perfumes. Just opening the bottle you'll get a sense. It's basically stronger smelling than all the other face washes I've bought in the past couple years looking for a replacement of the originally Sensitive Face Wash. The smell is cheap and bad - I'd compare it to the fragrance of an Old Spice body wash. The first time I used it besides being annoyed by the smell, I felt it actually DID dry my skin out. Certainly more than the old formula but also probably more than any face wash I've used.<br /><br />I tried it again and that night I basically sneezed all night. I thought perhaps sneezing all night was related to using it but figured it just was a coincidence. About a week later I tried it one last time and this time I sneezed all night again and basically got no sleep. This isn't something that happens to me a lot - the last time I stayed up all night sneezing was probably a year ago when I stayed in a house with lots of cats. So i feel about 99% sure that the heavy perfumes are causing an allergic reaction for me. Obviously everyone is different but I think one of the things many people are sensitive to is perfumes so it makes no sense that this product has so many.<br /><br />There is a section on the back of the bottle titled &#34;what you get&#34; and this version and the old one are basically the same except the old has an additional bullet point saying &#34;formula is soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol free to minimize the risk of skin irritation.&#34; The new bottle does notmake that claim because they clearly have lots of soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol.<br /><br />It's just very frustrating that they discontinued a product that was so helpful and came up with a new one that is the exact opposite with the same branding as before. Why not sure keep a formula that is actually helpful for people with sensitive skin?	2015-08-16

Its very quick, as fast as shaving 3. Easy to clean 4. Not very painful, just on armpits and bikini  Cons 1. Messy, hair ends up everywear as it pulls the hair and you need to be dry. You could do this is the tub, but you would need an  extesion cord. 2. Knees and creases are hard to work, you need to take your time. 3. Not really intended for bikini area, might need to do something else here.  Overall great product, I have not worn long pants since purchasing this.	2015-08-16

This is the ONLY shampoo I have EVER used that actually lives up to its claims and does what it says it will. My hair has always been dry, curly/frizzy and tangles easily. This shampoo along with the same conditioner and mask have done AMAZING things for my hair. I can comb through my hair directly after bathing and not encounter any tangles or snarls, and my hair remains soft long after it dries completely, and of course it smells heavenly.  Being that I have this kind of hair, I only wash my hair once or twice a week, so I should be well stocked on this for awhile.  If you can't find it at your local TJ Maxx (SO much cheaper) then it is STILL worth the hefty price tag.	2015-08-16

If you want to extend your appeal beyond places like Santa Cruz and Berkeley, you need to come up with a better name for the product and better packaging too.  Regarding the product, itself, I do like it.  I bought the unscented version and it actually has a modest but pleasant scent.  But the deodorant is so firm, that the Pit Paste folks suggest you hold the product under your arm for a few seconds to warm it up and allow it to soften.  Otherwise, it's like rubbing a large pencil eraser under your arm - feels pretty unfordable and not much product actually gets applied.  I find that it takes about 10 seconds for the product to warm up.  But once you do that, the product does apply and it works well.  It prevents body odor and seems to have no adverse effects.  The product would receive 5 stars if they could improve the formula to be softer and easier to apply and if they improved the &#34;cringe&#34; branding.	2015-08-16

If it's somewhere a bit more sensitive like your armpits it'll hurt a bit more than let's say your lower legs.

The container is small enough to toss in my bad so I can reapply if needed on extra hot or active days. Applying is super easy as well.

So I will be giving it 2 stars because I could not ever get the strips to stay properly applied for more than half an hour without popping up. At first I tried applying a strip long enough for the entire nail, but when trying to get the second side applied, the 1st side would pop up. It would seem my nail was too curved (though I wouldn't call it a big curve by any means) the instructions have an answer for this, and it's to start smaller and cut the strip small and cover the middle of the nail so it's not as bent. I tried that and it worked. I put on socks and went about my day. But about 30 minutes later, I took my sock off to inspect and it had popped up on one side. I took it off (it came off easily, even though the instructions say not to pull on it with force to remove), and tried again with another short strip. Same thing. 30 minutes pass and I feel it come undone<br /><br />The only good thing I can say is that during the short periods it was applied, I felt discomfort, but that to me just meant it was most likely doing it's job. I really wanted these to work, but now I'll have to resort to old fashioned methods. At $50 dollars and only coming with 10 strips, this would be a great deal if they went on and stayed on as easily as implied by the site. But when you're throwing away strip after strip because the bonding process is very difficult, it becomes worrisome and seems like less of a deal	2015-08-16

It absorbs quickly and doesn't feel greasy or make me perspire while wearing it, which is important since I make sure I apply it before leaving the house. I am fair skinned so this SPC 30 works perfect for me. After years of sun exposure, I have seen the damage the sun can do to unprotected skin. Biopsies and having your skin frozen is not fun, best to make sure sunscreen is part of your normal routine!<br /><br />This sunscreen (to me at least) does seem to have a slight fragrance, what I can smell is not unpleasant and is very faint. I apply this to exposed skin 30 minutes before leaving the house. This sunscreen is light enough to wear under makeup. I have even mixed a drop of my makeup into a few drops of sunscreen as a tint and then applied to my face. The  A,B,C, and E vitamins, as well as the seaweed extract, does seem to lock in moisture and help my skin look nice and stay hydrated. Just make sure you reapply after a couple of hours, or if you swim or perspire.<br /><br />Once I apply to my skin I can feel the difference, my skin feels really soft. It doesn't feels heavy or smell like coconuts and the beach, which makes it nice for daily use. For the past couple of days we've had 100+ degree weather here in Southern Calif., and this sunscreen has helped me keep from burning. I burn very easily, normally I would have started to pink up in about 10 minutes in this heat. I was running in and out of the house most of the day and got some color, but did not burn! :)<br /><br />Free product sample received for review purposes.<br /><br />*Updated 9/25/15 - We decided we were going to spend our anniversary on a whale watching cruise. It's been so hot here over the past few weeks and it was so much cooler on the coast.  Mr. Doom & Gloom (my husband),  looks at me as we're waiting to board the boat and says, &#34; Ooooo you didn't bring a hat,...and you're wearing short sleeves too,...you're going to get so burnt! You'll be sorry tonight.&#34; :/<br /> I had applied this sunscreen to all exposed skin 30 minutes before we left the house and tossed the bottle in my purse in case I needed to reapply later. I never did have to reapply, and after spending 3 hours on a boat and 30+ minutes waiting in line without shade I can honestly say this is the BEST sunscreen I've ever used!!  I was a tiny bit pink later that evening but not burnt at all. I am very, very fair skinned so after being out in the hot sun for almost 4 hours I was very happy with the performance of this sunscreen!had applied this sunscreen to all exposed skin 30 minutes before we left the house and tossed the bottle in my purse in case I needed to reapply later.

One of the more affordable hair treatment sprays by a product line brand that I trust. In use with other Aussie products or other brands altogether, this stuff is great after a shower. My husband has longer, thicker hair than mine and it makes his locks luster. His split ends are minimal and the overall health of his hair is high, during the summer he gets pretty bad frizz but this spray helps to combat that and keep his hair from drying out.<br /><br />If I were to have any cons about this stuff, it's the fact it smells so good that bees seem to seek me out. But the buzzing terror is worth it for nice hair!!!	2015-08-16

This is a line that I want to definitely invest in as it really had a great result even after the first use. I cannot say enough how wonderful this made my face feel and look- with using this I believe that it will continue to disallow the fine lines and wrinkles from starting to appear on my face. That is a huge concern of mine. Now I am more assured that I found this product and excited to try the other products this company has to offer. I did receive a discount on this product for my unbiased opinion. I will attest that this is a luxury item and well worth the price point due to the high quality of this formula.	2015-08-16

Worked very fast, much faster than expected when paired with my dentist made guards. People visibly noticed the difference after the second session. There was some slight irritation on the gums the few times, but that is expected due to the nature of the ingredients. It is best to do a couple of days, have a day off and then hit it again. Be patient! There was some light discolouration on my gums after each treatment. However, it was only momentarily discoloured and returned to normal after 15 minutes. It is important to post treat your teeth and I used GC Tooth Mousse as advised by many dentists because it is scientifically proven to protect tooth enamel. I found the taste quite neutral, but prepare yourself to become a spit factory!	2015-08-16

I most likely would have never tried this scent out, which would have been a terrible thing for me given how much I enjoy it.  It's a pleasant, spicy scent that, in my eyes (and nose) practically screams &#34;gentleman.&#34;  The list of scents are on Fragrantica if anyone is interested in the reviews on it there.<br /><br />As far as the shave itself, ToOBS is popular for a reason.  I've used everything from hard soaps to soft creams and this is one of my favorites yet.  Something worth noting - this is a thirsty cream.  If you feel like you need more, try adding a little more water first.  You'll be pleased with how much longer the tub will last.	2015-08-16

It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don't rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. My only criticism with this razor is it is difficult to clean when soap scum builds up. There are a lot of nooks and crannies that are hard to get to. Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value. Highly recommended!	2015-08-16

This is a good product, but I want to give a word of warning from my experience. The first three applications I left product on for 1 minute then followed with suggested baking soda neutralizer, then rinsed. I was left with horrible burns/marks for months. Just got the nerve up to try this product again, but this time just rinsed thoroughly with cold water and skipped baking soda neutralizer, then followed with aloe moisturizer.... No burn. Left my skin smooth/shiny and soft, yet looking like I spent a nice day at the beach (i. e. touch of red glow). Will use again in a week. I am 40 years old with fine lines and a couple age spots. Hoping after more applications to reduce both. Thankful to have solved the burning problem. I guess baking soda neutralizer does not work for all people.	2015-08-16

Two eye shadow brushes accompany the beautiful shadows. It is almost too pretty to disturb, but when I finally did, I am in love with the results. Very smooth and easy to apply to my lids. There is no flaking, no clumping, just smoothness and beautiful colors to my lids. I did receive this palette at discount in exchange for an honest review, and I must attest that this is by far one of the best palettes I have ever owned. Would I buy this again?

I wish the toothbrush had a timer	I haven't owned an electric toothbrush in years so I don't know how they compare with battery operated toothbrushes; however, battery operated toothbrushes get my teeth much cleaner than manually brushing them.  I've been using a battery operated toothbrush for about a year now.<br /><br />The Spinbrush Radiant toothbrush gets my teeth just as clean as the Phillips Powerup.<br />I wish the Spinbrush would automatically turn off after 2 minutes. I deducted 1/2 star because it doesn't have a timer.<br /><br />The Spinbrush toothbrush is not as jarring as Phillips Powerup battery operated toothbrush.  However, the brush heads are thicker than the Powerup's; they're thicker than a regular toothbrush too.  The thicker brush head is hard for me to get used to. Deducted 1/2 star for thick brush head.<br />UPDATE: I got used to the thicker brush head.<br /><br />I used Arm & Hammer Brilliant Sparkle toothpaste for several years. It was a family favorite. When I couldn't find Brilliant Sparkle anymore, I purchased Advance White Extreme Whitening (I liked their Brilliant Sparkle formula better).  This is the first time I've tried Truly Radiant and will update my review if I have a more radiant smile in 5 days.<br />Truly Radiant also strengthens your tooth enamel.<br /><br />UPDATE: The toothpaste is great. My teeth are two or three shades whiter. It's hard to tell exactly without using a chart.<br /><br />This kit has everything you need:<br />2 battery operated toothbrushes<br />1 tube of Arm & Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste<br />2 replacement brushes<br />4 pre-installed AA batteries (2 for each toothbrush)<br /><br />When I mentioned that I was using a battery operated toothbrush to my dental hygenist, she asked how much the replacement heads were. Apparently many people don't buy electric toothbrushes because the electric toothbrush  & replacement heads cost  quite a bit.<br />If that's a concern of yours, give this battery operated toothbrush a try. It's more affordable.<br /><br />When I gave my grandkids (ages 4 & 5) a child's battery operated toothbrush, they were really excited & told their parents how much cleaner their teeth felt.<br /><br />One star deducted because the toothbrush doesn't have a timer & the brush head is thicker than the average brush head.<br /><br />Colors:<br />In case you're wondering, I received one pink toothbrush & one purple toothbrush. They aren't available for purchase yet (8/22/15), so I don't know if you will have a choice of colors. I noticed some reviewers received one blue toothbrush & one green.h, they were really excited & told their parents how much cleaner their teeth felt.

Colors:  In case you're wondering, I received one pink toothbrush & one purple toothbrush. They aren't available for purchase yet (8/22/15), so I don't know if you will have a choice of colors.

In fact, I purchased this item to replace the exact same hairdryer, which I had for probably about five years before it finally fizzled out.  It's comfortable to hold, it dries my long, thick hair quickly (no easy feat), and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  I initially replaced my old hairdryer with a different (more expensive) ionic hairdryer, and didn't get the same results.  So I looked for an exact replacement on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find it, not to mention at such a good price.  Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to click the &#34;Buy now with 1-Click&#34; button, and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Tourmaline Ceramic technology - emits infrared heat and negative ions, which makes it gentler on hair and faster drying<br />Lightweight, comfortable to hold and use<br />Long cord<br />Foldable - packs and stores easily and compactly<br /><br />CONS:<br />Doesn't have separate heat and speed settings<br />The on/off switch is a little difficult to use<br />Doesn't have a retractable cord	2015-08-16

When washing there is no color transfer and very little if any brush shedding. I have several of the eye brushes already, but I do not have this set. I'm adding to my collection because these brushes are so similar to the Sigma and Morphe brushes with the less expensive price tag. I would recommend this brand of brushes to anyone who was in the market for new brushes on a limited budget. Go directly to Lamora website and once you register you will get I think 10% off your first purchase and the site automatically directs you to Amazon for purchasing. Plus the brush sets come in these cute little round brush case. I have zero CONS at this time	2015-08-16

I'm seeking alternatives, but I suppose no one wants to spend time making a good one.<br /><br />While it worked, it was stellar. So, the battery and cheap door hinge are my hangups. At least allow the battery (a single AA battery was found after I took the unit apart) to be changed by the user. Add a $2 battery compartment and call it a day... Then add a cheap pin hinge, and you'd be all set!	2015-08-16

I am 27 years old and have been suffering from mild to severe hormonal acne since I was 16. I have been using the All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment for about 3 years. It has made all the difference in the world in my appearance, the feel and health of my skin, and my confidence level. I tried many other products, discovering that I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide and that most anti-acne regimes are terrible for my skin because their goal is to dry it out completely. Salicylic acid is the only known alpha hydroxy acid; it is lipid soluble and penetrates the follicle and breaks down excess sebum, allowing the follicle to drain. But because it does this, salicylic acid on it's own can be rather harsh and can leave the skin horribly dry and vulnerable to cracking and thus more susceptible to bacteria. This is especially true when it is applied to a sensitive skin like mine.<br />Luckily, I discovered the All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment, which I began to use in conjunction with the All-in-one Acne Facial Scrub and the Pink Grapefruit Scrub (I believed that adding a beta hydroxy acid to the use of the alpha hydroxy acid would be helpful, understanding that although it is only water soluble, it is proven to break down dead skin cells on the surface). The results were almost immediate and amazing. I experimented a bit and tried just the scrubs. That left my skin far too dry and peeling. The All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment moisturized my skin overall and left it feeling smooth, even, and silky, while it healed ruptured acne and soothed it, and made new acne disappear within two days at most. I was hoping that it would help my acne, but that it  achieved this AND made my skin incredibly soft and smooth was a pleasant surprise! This is because it is a moisturizing cream formula. As I have done more research, I havediscovered another reason for this. In addition to being anti-aging and anti-wrinkle, retinol is used against acne because, just like salicylic acid, it speeds up skin cell regeneration by breaking down excess sebum and dead skin cells. I have tried the best products containing retinol and find that the All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment is far superior, even as an anti-aging product. I have concluded that salicylic acid is as good as if not superior to retinol in fighting wrinkles, despite the fact that it is not advertised as such.<br />The All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment has changed my life. I am an athlete and I work in high end retail. My appearance makes a difference to my level of success. I used to have to get up so much earlier to fit in my makeup routine because I had to cover up my acne thoroughly. Or I would forego my workout routine because I knew my skin would have to dry after showering to be ready for the makeup I had to use to cover my acne. And I often could not wear scoop necklines or V backs because I was far to embarrassed by my acne, especially where my sports bra chafed and irritated my skin. But the All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment (which I frankly wish you offered in much bigger tubes) changed all of that! I apply it right after my shower to my damp skin. It has improved my skin so much and has improved my daily routine. I work out, shower quickly, apply the treatment, throw clothes on without worrying about whether they cover up acne (because it isn't there!), apply a minimal amount of makeup, and feel like a boss all day. The All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment has done all of this.<br />It has been discontinued. As soon as I discovered this, I read as many reviews as possible, attempting to discover why you have discontinued this product. But almost all the reviews were favourable. Some were reminiscent of my own experience. I called your customer service number. The representative was polite, but clearly had no intention of relaying my clear messages to her higher ups. She recommended a different product. I was skeptical because I had tried a Clearasil gel formula before and it was awful.<br /><br />I decided to give the Rapid Clear 2-in1 Fight and Fade Gel a chance. But because it is a gel and not a soothing cream, it irritates the surface of the skin, leaving it dry, red, and cracking. It does nothing to heal ruptured acne. Moreover, a gel formula makes it so that the substance sticks to itself. It is NOT absorbed by the skin! It forms a layer that sits on the skin's surface and when the skin is moved too much (i.e. smiling, talking, raising an eyebrow, laughing, breathing), this layer breaks apart and peels off, turning into a disgusting coagulated mess. It also did this as soon as I tried to add a sunscreen or makeup. I then attempted to only use it at night,  only to find that it peeled off and little bits of it were all over my pillow. In short, this product is awful. I am infinitely disappointed that you have replaced such a reliable, effective product as the All-in-one Acne Facial Treatment with this inferior product that Clearasil and Clean and Clear already have out on the market. And I am resentful that your Customer service representative recommended it to me.<br />I understand if your plan is to reintroduce the treatment cream in an improved formula (with 2% salicylic acid content rather than 1% and/or with glycolic acid added for example), however, why discontinue the former when you are not ready to release the new one?	2015-08-16

I purchased this in the hope that a lip plumper would help with my disappearing upper lip. Seems the older we get, the less lip we have, unless it is a verbal zinger aimed at a deserving fool. The liquid went on smoothly and gave my lips a discreet shine. I could feel a tingling on my skin, but waited to give it time to work. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. I was still feeling the tingle as I rushed to the mirror for the reveal. Nothing. No plumping, no increase to my shriveled upper lip. Phooey! I give this a 2 star because it works as a lip gloss and it stays on long enough to keep my lips moist. But as a plumper - I am beginning to wonder if there is such a thing!	2015-08-16

Would I buy it again? No.  First off the strongest item in this set is the stand. Its beautiful, its heavy, and has an all around quality to it.  As for the brush, I have read a few reviews that say you shouldnt really buy a badger brush unless its a bit more cash. Im gonna go out on a limb here and say I agree. This brush, while does indeed work, and is an authentic badger brush, isnt that great. I can already tell its not gonna last &#34;years&#34;. Maybe it will, but the brush itself will probably be crummy and hairless by the end of one year. I realize its normal for the brush to shed a FEW hairs for the first month or two, but this thing is averaging 7 lost hairs per shave. Maybe I got a bum brush? Probably not, as I go into the razors review, but its far more of a pain in the rear to return this entire set....than to push forward.  Now the razor. You are probably buying this set because you are new to wet shaving (like myself). Be aware that the perfecto razor (which can also be purchased separately outside this kit, is a very &#34;aggressive&#34; shave. Do your homework because you can EASILY take a decent amount of skin off your face with an angle that is too sharp, or a crummy lather. I have a nice area of red scar tissue that is still healing two weeks later. While my technique is definitely improving daily, this razor leaves little room for error, and will let you know when your &#34;skills&#34; are lacking. Maybe thats a good thing? Baptism by fire ya know?  But my BIGGEST problem with this kit is that the razor itself lacks in construction. When you unscrew the handle from the head to change a razor, there is another the handle can unscrew from directly under the primary tightening location. If you are unlucky like me, the handle wont screw off from the head but the handle will unscrew off from itself (if that makes any sense). I was running late for work and needed to change a blade after I noticed the one I had tugging. I attempted to unscrew the handle and the head was locked shut as I unscrewed it from itself. It took me 10 min running around like a buffoon in my underwear trying to get the darn head open. I had to grab PLIERS! from the garage just to get this thing separated. I ended up super gluing the handle back to the small piece it unscrewed from and hopefully this fixes the problem.  Either way, I would splurge a few extra bucks. Buy the stand by itself, get a boar brush if you are trying to save cash, and splurge and extra $10 and get a razor of higher quality. I did the math and if I can get &#34;6 months&#34; out of this purchase, I will break even and can try with a new razor in my quest to save money and have a better shave.	2015-08-16

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It doesn't have a great coffee smell. Not a coffee I would want to smell anyway. More of an artificial smell, which I have a hard time with. I have allergies to artificial fragrances. Did use the soap, it is nicely hydrating. But, this soap will go to my husband. *8-20-15 addendum to original review: I will say, as soon as I posted this review, at 3 stars, I received an email from the company. Quickest customer service ever. Offered immediately to see what they could do to make my experience better. I thought, wow. How great. I have never even been contacted by a company that I have given a one star for, let alone a three.  So, he explained, since the bars are produced by batch, this batch may have had more chocolate in it. Which, now that my nose and brain have a frame of reference, is what I smell. Chocolate, not coffee. He also sent more bars to see if we could find one that matched my scent palate better. One fit the bill for my hubby well, island drift, and one fit my sensitive nose, goats milk citrus twist. And as before, they are hydrating and don't leave a strong odor on your skin after, which we like. Thanks soap company, you restore my faith in customer service and buying from small companies.	2015-08-16

I have been using this product for well over a week now and I can 100% say this product is Amazing!! I have been using it after the microderm scrub bio response has and my skin and neck has never looked more healthy and glowing! It feels firm, and my makeup goes on so much better now. My neck is more firm, and with getting older it's very important to me. I highly recommend this product a long with the scrub, 100% will be buying with or without discount!	2015-08-16

Beauty	3	2	3	N	Y	Great Lotion...Good Luck Getting it all out of the Bottle	The product itself works very well.  It makes your skin very soft and gave me some deeper color.  However, with the thickness of the lotion and the square shape of the bottle, it makes it very difficult to get any out of the bottle once it is past half way empty.  I even turned it upside down in my tanning bag so it would be near the top to help get out last 1/3 of the bottle.  Nope...didn't make any difference.  It is so thick (which is NOT a bad thing if the bottle was shaped differently...I believe) that it won't ooze its way down to make it easier to get out.<br /><br />Love the lotion, hate the bottle.  I want to use all of the lotion I am paying for, especially when it is so expensive.	2015-08-16

I must say though that the glove that is included isn't the best quality.  I had to use a different one because the one that came with this wand still allows most of the heat through and that can be painful if not used properly.

All it can do is darken what you've already got. That said, this is a quick, cost effective alternative to having your lashes tinted in a salon. I've paid for professional lash tinting before and my at-home results with this product are comparable. I have been using Latisse for about two months and while my lashes are noticeably longer, they are too blonde to show up without makeup. This product helps a lot. I used regular clean cotton swabs to apply the liquid, then applied the gel with a clean mascara spoolie instead of the comb that came with the kit. Personal preference. I started out with the shield papers under my eyes, but I ended up throwing them away and proceeding without them. If you dab a little eye cream on the skin around your eyes before starting and keep a clean damp cotton swab handy for wiping off goofs, you shouldn't have to worry too much about rogue stains. I did get a little bit of the gel in one eye and it stung like a beast for maybe fifteen seconds, but I blinked it out easily and the redness went away about a minute after the stinging stopped. It didn't prevent me from finishing the job or affect my results, so I still think this deserves five stars. I am particularly delighted with the short processing time. I did one eye at a time, first the bottom lashes, then the top, so I repeated the whole process four times. I was still done in less than fifteen minutes. Can't beat that.	2015-08-16

My shaving setup is Trumpers Rose shave cream and a Vulfix Super Badger Brush. Blades used: Astra Super Stainless (came with the razor) 3 stars Personna Blue 3 stars Rapira Platinum Lux 4 stars Feather Stainless 5 stars  This is a great razor for the beginning wet shaver or the experienced one. This is a very mild razor. I would directly compare this to an Edwin Jagger DL89. Shave wise I see no difference. The razor is well crafted. There is no play in the razor head. I have been shaving with this razor for 2 weeks with a variety of blades. I did knock off 1 star for an issue with the paint. There was a small piece of dirt that had gotten under the paint. This was on the top plate on the bottom side at the edge where it would come in contact with the blade the most. This in turn caused the blade to warp. A quick session with a pocket knife and the issue was fixed. I have not had the paint chip like other reviewers. The paint actually gave a more positive grip on the razor. All in all this is a great addition to my razor collection, This will be in my regular rotation.	2015-08-16

Finally - something that works without aluminum & white residue (when applied per the instructions)!<br /><br />Being a &#34;very blessed&#34; woman (shout-out to you, S Mares) living in 100+ deg F heat in the summer, I have struggled with below & between breast moisture issues for most of my adult life.  The options I've tried for keeping moisture at bay on a longer basis include aluminum-containing products or baby powder/corn starch powders that left serious white patches on the skin & clothing.<br /><br />I am so pleased with this product.  It hasn't completely wiped out all of the moisture (Hello, 100+ deg F heat), but it has mostly kept it at bay.  You have to follow the instructions - shake well before use (or it may be watery) and spread evenly & thinly to avoid white patches / streaks on the skin.  You also need to let it completely dry & wash your hands before putting on clothing or you'll get white marks on your clothes.<br /><br />This was a great find & I will definitely be reordering on a regular basis.	2015-08-16

I actually have never used these on my eyebrows but they work great for trimming up my nail applications like Jamberry! They are very sharp and cut through it easily. They fit in your hand easily and are comfortable even after cutting for quite a little while. Because they are small  they maneuver easily. I’m sure with the quality these things are made it would be no issue to cut through some eyebrow hair, but becareful because they are very sharp.

After all	I've owned convertible sports cars for most of my adult life, and my wife is always had trouble writing in one because the wind messing up her hair. A few years back I suggested she start using one of the long clips for holding her hair. Problem was that it just didn't seem to hold as well when in a car at 65 miles an hour or more. So when I saw all these Sectioning Alligator Clips, with the large teeth, I thought it was worth getting to see if it works any better. After all, the price was good and overall it look like a product well worth a try.<br /><br />I'm glad to report that my first evaluation approved to be very accurate. Not only do the clips hold her hair well while in the ragtop but they've also become a favorite of hers for a number of jobs in the garden around the house. She is even taken to wearing the clips as a fashion accessory and find them exceptionally well designed for holding longer hair. I can imagine a better review for product like this and I guess in the long run I'm saying that I would recommend this product to anyone else who wants to hold their hair securely.	2015-08-16

I have had acne problem since 15-16 yrs. Have tried all kinds of acne products including Proactiv, they would work for a while but could not completely stop the breakouts.

The best thing was it did not dry out my skin and instead made it softer, younger looking, beautiful, and flawless. I could say it has even made me a little fairer. I used to avoid nuts as I would have a breakout immediately after taking them. But just a few days back I had about a handful of almonds and peanuts...and no breakouts!	2015-08-16

I had a very bad fall about a week ago and because of blood thinner medications I'm on I both bleed and bruise way too easily.  My fall created some enormous bruises on my leg and although I'd never heard of Arnica before, some research led me to this product.  I've been using it for the past several days and I've noticed that my bruises are noticeably fading pretty quickly. I can't speak to whether there is scientific evidence behind this particular therapy or not because I haven't found that evidence, but I can say that this product is soothing and smells nice and it absorbs well.  My body doesn't normally &#34;fix&#34; bruises this fast by itself though and so for that reason I tend to believe that there is something to it after all.  I'll be buying it again.	2015-08-16

Beauty	4	6	9	N	Y	Positive experience	For an upcoming cruise to warm climates, I plan to wear sundresses.....much more comfortable than capris and shirts.  However, I have widespread networks of spider veins.  Because we will be I the sun a lot, I tried to match the Dermablend color to my tanned legs.  I bought the samples from WhatSheBuys, and finally decided that Caramel might work best.  It does appear to be a little on the &#34;orange&#34; side, but after I use the setting powder it's quite acceptable.  Though I'm a little self-conscious about wearing leg make-up, it does make a very nice, even tone on my legs.  You have to be looking fairly closely to realize it's make-up.  It is comfortable, not greasy.  With the setting powder it never budged until I used cleanser cream to remove it.  Looking forward to having nice looking legs without stockings for the first time in years.	2015-08-16

I will be contacting Amazon about this. Alone, this is a resolvable problem and not worthy of a poor review. What really matters is the product itself. From a skin softening standpoint, the lotion does work and it isn't terribly greasy. But what makes it unusable by me at least, is the extremely strong scent. This is not a masculine scent at all -- it is a cross between a moth-repelling cedar hanger and an artificial rose/floral scent (think cheap women's perfume). I am not sensitive to smell and indeed, with my current allergies, my sense of smell is diminished. The aroma of this lotion cuts through my stuffed up nose,  and having only applied it to my hands, I can smell it on me as I type this review. I certainly will not be buying this again and I do not recommend it. Why is it hard to make a natural lotion with recognizable ingredients and a subtle scent? It certainly is possible -- subtract the natural fragrances and non-moisturizing, non-nutritive essential oils from this product and I'm sure it would be fine. I am not sure how anyone could classify this as a &#34;light&#34; scent and I certainly won't be ordering it again.	2015-08-16

Beauty	4	1	1	N	N	Ariam Beauty Vitamin C Cream	Vitamin C is known for it's properties of reducing wrinkles and roseola as well as moisturizing the face and neck. Ariam Beauty Vitamin C Cream has a pleasant, not to strong fragrance. The texture is rich and creamy. As with so many facial creams, serums and moisturizers you only need a small amount. I applied it in tiny circles on my cheek and neck area. Use a light touch when applying. I have dry skin and this cream did do a good of moisturizing it. The down side is, my face felt tingly and the small amount of roseola became more visible. I waited a few minutes and the tingle feeling abated. The redness, did not go away. I do use a good foundation which covered the redness. However, if the redness continues, I will discontinue use as stated on the jar. I received this at a reduced price for my honest review.

It's a little tricky to stretch on past a tender broken ankle, but once it's over, you're golden. It's a bit tight but that's what keeps the water out so well. It feels pretty durable (it's like the vinyl material they make inflatable pools out of) and what I like is that it's reusable. And when I'm healed I can hold onto this and pull it out or give it away in case of emergency. Now I'm a pretty heavy woman myself, so if it fits me comfortably, I'm sure it'll fit all shapes and sizes.	2015-08-16

I've owned this pallet for 8 months and I can 100% say this is a good product for a good price. I've used this more than my UD pallet.<br /><br />One of the positives is the matte shades - I like to use these to get a base shadow/s on the eye and then use the shimmery shades.<br /><br />Now the negatives ... I find that the shimmery shades are redundant. The medium shimmery browns are basically the same. The other downside is that they've changed in consistency over time, especially the glittery ones. They feel  dryer and have a lot of fallout.<br /><br />Bottom line -- absolutely worth purchasing the pallet!<br /><br />Enjoy!	2015-08-16

I see a lot of negative reviews of this stuff on here and I think it's mostly because of the foreign concept of a cleansing conditioner. It's not going to foam up like a conventional shampoo because A, there's no SLS in it and B, it's more of the consistency of a conditioner. So just pretend like you're just going to use conditioner on your hair and you'll be fine.<br /><br />That being said, there are some tricks to getting the most out of this stuff. First, use waaaay more than the directions say to use, especially if you've got crazy long/thick/curly hair like I do. I work it through in sections, paying really good attention to the crown of my head because thats where I had trouble the first 1-2 times I used this. Massage the crap out of your scalp, and then comb the stuff all the way down to your ends. If you've got fuzzy ends like I tend to get, put some more on the ends. Leave it on for a few minutes, but seriously not a lifetime. Then rinse! It's really not rocket science.<br /><br />I'm not wild about the scent of this one, but it doesn't last too long like other shampoos so I didn't remove any stars for that. I'll just try a different scent next time. All in all, I'm a cleansing conditioner convert thanks to this stuff (ps - I've never tried Wen or any of the other products like it, so maybe I'm missing out, but this stuff satisfies my needs for $10 instead of $32 haha). Oh! And this bottle lasted me about 2 months washing twice a week, so if you're a daily hair washer, maybe this isn't the best thing out there for you.	2015-08-16

This shaver is kind to the skin and does a marvelous job. If it were to die on me tomorrow I would buy another. The Braun will stay in a box for a long time until I cannot find another of these.

So for a couple of months I used the expensive brand but decided that it wasn't worth the cost and decided to come back the Dove brand.<br /><br />My views have changed.  I used to love this based on the smell and partially because of the conditioning feel that I got from it but smell was the big component - I loved the pomegranate & lemon verbena scent.  The scent of the last bottle that I received was off and had a weird smell.  I don't think my preference changed because of trying the expensive brand because I also use (and went back to) the Dove shampoo with the same scents and I still like that.  Maybe the new bottle is defective or maybe the manufacturer adjusted it's recipe but because it has become difficult to find in physical stores (ie Target, WalMart, etc) and I could only find it on Amazon, I'm in the market for a new conditioner.	2015-08-16

If you buy it direct and follow the instructions. I'm not sure why anyone would pay 3-5 times as much to order this on Amazon, but you have no idea what you are getting, if the product has been damaged, etc. It is super sketchy. That said, I bought direct from Ava Anderson Non-Toxic. Tested on myself first at the beach before testing on my kids. It works! And doesn't make my children's exzema flare. It's been a godsend for us. This is natural, zinc based sunscreen with organic oils. This means you need to apply at least 15 minutes before going out. Most importantly, you must knead the tube each time you apply AND knead in your hand to be sure nothing has settled and you are getting an even amount of zinc, which acts as a physical barrier to sun's rays vs most (harmful) chemical sunscreens. You also need to reapply after swimming/sweating, etc. Remember this isn't being absorbed into your skin like chemical sunscreens-which is a good thing!! But it does mean you need to reapply and follow the directions carefully. It's been SO worth the little bit of extra effort for my family. Before this I was using Water Babies on my kids, not knowing it was one of the top rated &#34;worst&#34; and &#34;most harmful&#34; for kids as rated by Environmental Working Group and other objective researchers.	2015-08-16

This toner is very gentle and does not dry your skin like some toners do.<br />I noted that it contains Colloidal Silver--which is supposed to heal skin tissue and reduce inflammation. But, i read that you should<br />not use Colloidal Silver for more than 14 days in a row so I will use this for 14 days, then take a 7 day break before resuming use for another 14 days. I don't normally use make-up so I don't feel the need to use a toner daily, but I would use this on days that I have to remove my CC cream because it provides an extra cleaning boost.	2015-08-16

Very well balanced, the scent is a mix of earthy tons, wood but not too heavy. It's a great perfume or blend to use for calming. Have used it actaully during meditation and it's meant to help soothe and calm out your nerves, my son likes this rolled onto his pillow at night. It's taken over the lavender he used to fall asleep with.<br /> Very grounding, very balanced. I create many of my own blends but this has got to be one of the most relaxing ones I've come across that is pre-blended.While it is an earthy wood scent don't let it steer you away ladies, it's been a fantasy perfume so far and I've had many compliments.  Wish I could have this in a dropper bottle and use in  a diffuser actaully, but really enjoy the roller ball. Best areas to place, is wrists, neck , even above your heart.  Roller balls are handy to take traveling, they are small for pockets, take up so little room you don't notice.  I will say that if you press too hard you will end up having too much oil on your skin, would just recommend gently rolling there's no need to be firm with it. The blend is patchouli, cederwood and based with jojoba oil ( carrier) unisex the scent is really perfect for anyone. I have noticed in the heat it carries really thick, ( not bad, but you will notice it more)  so be mindful of that, a little does go a long way but other than that I really enjoy this balanced blend . Comes in a cute tin container, which I love, so you can reuse that after you've finished the roller ball, a little tip- once you are done with the roller ball, pop that plastic roller out and place some Epson salt inside ( bath salts) . The salt will absorb the oil along the glass and you can add that into a bath, so very relaxing! Would recommend this to any of my friends, makes a great gift!<br />*I received the following product(s) to review at a discounted price. I was not required to write a positive review no other monetary compensation was given . Any and all opinions are my own.	2015-08-16

After moving to the desert I was in desperate need of a solution to moisturizing my face that didn't include laying on 12 layers of lotion all day and clogging my pores up.  I found this while researching and was offered a discount in exchange for testing the product and reviewing it.<br /><br />The shipping was acceptable, the product is really large, much larger than most night creams I have come across.<br /><br />I have been testing the product at night before  bed because I feel like that is when my skin has the best opportunity to absorb.<br /><br />Here are some things I noticed:<br /><br />I definitely feel my skin is softer, no doubt about it.  My eye make up and foundation seem to apply and appear smoother and blend easier, less blotching from the dry skin.<br /><br />The fragrance is nice. Not overpowering, just light and airy.<br /><br />You don't feel greasy or heavy when you put it on, and it's absorbed and nice by morning.<br /><br />Recommendations: Do NOT forget to apply this to your neck area as well as your face.

Enjoy!	This appears to be a durable and quality blow dryer that has many features, looks great and is easy to operate.  I use it to dry my hair after showering and it does a great job.<br /><br />My wife uses it much more than I do.  Here is what she has to say.<br /><br />“I must confess that I have not had to purchase a blow dryer for about 10 years. I was pleasantly surprised when my husband asked me to use the Revlon 5 piece deluxe blowout set with IONIC and Tourmaline  technology. This light weigh easy to use dryer has triple ceramic coating that provides heat distribution which penetrates hair quickly and that cuts drying time.  The tourmaline ionic technology eliminates static electricity and frizz. There are three heat settings cool, warm and hot. A new feature to me is the cool shot which I find helpful for post shower hot flashes.<br /><br />The handle has a textured hand grip that helps with wet hands.  Also there is a round blowout brush, a concentrator attachment and two sectional clips that aid in styling your hair.  I have what I call thyroid hair, it is thin, dry and lackluster. I do find that this dryer has given my hair a little more volume and appears to me to shiner, less frizzy and less dry looking. My styling/blowout time has decreased and that allows me another cup of coffee before leaving for work. This makes me a happy lady.”<br /><br />We are happy with this blow dryer and would recommend it to family, friends and those of you looking for an easy to use, quality blow dryer that is very functional.  Enjoy!	2015-08-16

I recently vacationed in New Orleans where the heat index got up to 107 on some days.  As you might imagine, lots of sweating occurred, but the Mia Adora mascara held up without smudging.  When I first got the mascara, I put it on without reading the directions, and I must say, I was quite disappointed.  However I went back and read the directions.  When applied as instructed, the mascara did an amazing job of lengthening and thickening my lashes.  I was surprised by the volume and length this mascara added to my eyelashes.  I had previously considered getting eyelash extensions done at a salon, now that is no longer a consideration with Mia Adora.  I was a bit concerned about eye irritation, but did not experience any at all.  I will definitely make this a mainstay of my cosmetic regime.  I highly recommend it.	2015-08-16

I recently received this epilator to review, by BzzAgent.<br />I've always wanted to try an epilator, but was always afraid to. Now that this little miracle tool has come into my life, I may never shave my legs again! Started with my underarms, just to get one of the most sensitive parts over with first (brave, I know!). That was scary at first, but I quickly realized that the anticipation was worst than the actual pain. Although it missed a few strays here and there, they were very easy to spot thanks to the bright beam of light. I went over them and they were quickly eliminated. Then, I decided to do my lower and upper legs. Lower legs were a snap and did not hurt at all. Upper legs were fine too, just a tiny discomforting on the inner upper thighs. Now, the bikini area... That was a whole other ball game. Front was easy, but definitely not painless, as I have very course hair there. After much flinching and toe curling, I was able to get thru most of it. On the sides, it pinched my skin once and left tiny red marks and that was really painful, but also my fault, as I did not stretch the skin enough. I decided to leave well enough alone and not get too close... I'll leave the more delicate areas to my trusty old razor, for now. All in all, I will continue to use this epilator mainly because it's quick, easy and for the most part tolerable. I can't wait to see how long the results last. I'm a true believer!	2015-08-16

It's so easy and doesn't hurt as much as other waxes I've tried, and after using it a few times, it doesn't hurt at all! It takes a while to heat up and melt, but is pretty quick to cool down and harden. One of the best things I like about this wax…NO MUSLIN STRIPS! Just apply with wooden stick, wait for wax to solidify and cool, peel up an edge, and strip away! It takes a few tries to get used to knowing when the wax is ready to be stripped off, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. I purchased this as a kit and it came with a video, which I highly recommend watching because it is pretty informative and gives some good tips on using this wax and will have you waxing like a pro in no time.	2015-08-16

Shake it, spray it, and spread it!<br /><br />The key to using this product is to spray it on your legs (or wherever you want it) and very quickly massage it all over. Do NOT put lotion on before or after using Airbrush Leg; if you do, you will find that the product will look blotchy and will wear off on your clothes. When applied without lotion, I found that it did not come off on my clothes.<br /><br />It is wonderfully water resistant and will stay put even while you're sweating. I found that it even stuck with me in the shower. I had to apply soap and or scrub to get it off. I'm pretty confident that one could wear this to the pool as long as you tenderly pat the water off with a towel, rather than rubbing.<br /><br />It has a gorgeous shimmer that makes your skin really look sumptuous.	2015-08-16

I am in love with the color combos used.<br /><br />To apply the tattoos:<br />You cut around the desired tattoo, close as you can get.<br />Remove the plastic.<br />Place the tattoo side down onto the skin.<br />Press the tattoo backing with a wet wash cloth.<br />Slowly peel the backing paper off.<br /><br />These last a long time on the skin, but it always depends on where you put it. I did put some on my fingers and they stayed on really well without fading even after washing my hands a lot. We went swimming for a bit and the tattoo was still intact-ed afterwards. The tattoos were so easy to apply that my four year old did one all on her own. These are fun and go with just about any outfit you are planning on wearing. You can wear a few without it being too much. One thing I love the most is I can't wear any type of jewelry right now as my son pulls on it. These are the next best thing. You can feel pretty and look awesome in these without having your kids pulling on them.<br /><br />I received this product at a deep discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-16

This is a pretty standard sweet, fruity scent. Smells like a less tangy Britney Spears Fantasy on my skin, complete with the creamy notes. It is pleasant and I enjoy it but it doesn't blow me away. Lasts 3-4 hours on my skin with low-moderate sillage. The bottle is frustrating as heck because the glitter comes off every time you touch it.

I travel overseas quite a bit, making weight and size extremely important to me. With its carrying case and brush, the razor weighs only 5.7 ounces and it is the smallest trimmer on the market.

More important, it does the job quickly and to perfection. I can easily change the length of the cut and I only need to blow on the razor to remove hair.	2015-08-16

The only thing i'm displeased about is how strong the smell is, but i knew about this before i purchased it since i have read some reviews about the smell. I really don't mind especially since i can just mix it with water or other lotions to reduce the strong smell, to me as long as it is effective that's all that matters.	2015-08-16

The natural next step, of course, would be to order it in a fragrance, but I was worried that since this is technically an oil for moisturizing and not an EDT or EDP there would be barely any staying power. Well, quite the opposite, to my pleasant surprise! The scene still fades by the end of the day, but there is at least a trace of it, whereas just about all actual perfumes I wear completely vanish within a few hours. I think I just have a skin-type or body temperature that eats up fragrance, unfortunately.<br /><br />The other amazing thing about this is the ingredients area almost all just natural fragrance oils and things that moisturize your skin while scenting it, not scary-sounding chemicals and alcohols like in true perfumes. Not to mention, it really does make your skin glow because of the oils.<br /><br />As for the scent itself, it's very sweet and feminine, without being little-girlish or candy-like. Normally I loathe musks (one of the three notes of this is Egyptian musk), but maybe that's what makes it not sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />If you've ever smelled Bodycology's Moroccan Sunset (you can find it at Target or drug stores, I believe), it's similar to that, but maybe a little more sophisticated. That's another thing - the notes are strawberry, mango and Egyptian musk, but blended together, I don't feel like I smell like any one of those things. They are combined in such a way that you just smell sweet and feminine but also sexy and exotic. Love!	2015-08-16

I loved everything about this cream, most especially that it dramatically softened my skin right away. So much so, that I would have considered using it in non-cellulite areas as a regular moisturizer. When I finished my first jar, knowing both customers and company indicated it may be weeks before I'd see a difference in the actual cellulite, I put in a new order for two jars. I then received two different jars (with the new silver band on the front). This formula seems very different to me. For one, the color is a disturbing beige (the previous one was white; was this intended to give customers a visible sense of the caffeine content? LOL). The new cream also seemed to have higher concentrations of whatever menthol-type agent was used, and it did not leave my skin's texture as soft as the previous cream. This new cream's impact on the cellulite is also different. Rather than changing the cellulite slowly but steadily over time, this new cream changes it more visibly faster but the change also seems to be more temporary. I've decided to finish out my two jars before considering another option.	2015-08-16

I have tried other retinol products, but I guess it is the addition of the coconut oil that puts this product over the top.  I have been using for about five days now, and I am not seeing the dryness that sometimes comes with products like this.  It does not have a strong or nasty smell, and it absorbs quickly and easily into your skin. I used it around my eyes as well as on my face. I have very sensitive skin, and it did not bother my thin skin around the eyes, or my face. I have noticed some lightening on my melasma, and less redness on my roseacea on my cheeks. I have also noticed fine line reduction around my eyes and lips. My skin looks brighter and feels more supple. I look forward to continuing to use this product and seeing more great results!!

I used it to grow my hair/edges. My hair was thin from constant manipulation, so I bought this to attempt to grow it out. It worked ok. I went from having a thin bald spot to a patch of hair where it used to be. I would recommend to moisturizer your hair with water first then massage the emu oil in the area you wish to grow. My results are a bit skewed because I wasn't consistent. Just remember to be consistent and put the oil in your hair every night. (I am black with natural hair).

I have a talent in drawing and am planning on getting an actual tattoo education soon, but I wanted to make sure I actually want to be a tattoo artist. I had no idea how to set the machine up, but wikihow fixed me up. It worked great- for the first week. The ink sucked, it wouldn't stay in the practice skin I ordered. But I put that aside, I could always order higher quality when I wanted to. I was very pleased with this kit until earlier today when the power supply popped and started smoking. I am half way through a tattoo on the fake skin. Plus, the foot petal actually burned my foot.  Overall, I think the machine was good, but the power supply/inks could use some help. And 5 needles is not enough. Would I recommend this? Sure, but only if you want to try for a day or two to confirm your want to be a tattoo artist.  DO NOT BUT IF YOU ARE HOPING TO DO FULL LENGTH TATTOOS...ONLY FOR PRACTICE😁 but I guess you get what you pay for, right?   UPDATE: I contacted the seller about a refund or replacement. They are shipping me a new power supply next Monday. The customer service was great, and now, I think this is worth the buy. UPDATE AGAIN: they shipped a new power supply on Monday, and I got it on Wednesday OF THE SAME WEEK. Plus- it was a higher quality box😋 thank you	2015-08-16

And no, I do not believe that you need an expensive roller in order to get the &#34;best&#34; results.  The big issue with this particular derma roller is that the needles on this roller are not consistent in size (i.e. one side of the roller's needles are longer than the other).  Additionally, the needles, upon rotating the roller, are uneven and inconsistent in length. These two add up to big problems in terms of rolling and seeing results, since you will not know which areas have been properly treated or not. Perhaps I had a dud, but I am not willing to take the risk in reordering this style again.  Do yourself a favor and find another brand to go with. I've had success with the MT brand [[ASIN:B00U20HRBS Facial Skin Care Needle Titanium Micro Acne Scars Derma Skin Roller Stretch Mark 0.5mm]], but there are others out there.	2015-08-16

It doesn't feel or smell like jojoba and the packaging doesn't look professional enough to convince me it's made by anyone but an amateur (maybe at-home) &#34;company.&#34;  The ad here on Amazon says it is certified organic, but it doesn't have any official label on the bottle, nor does it say who certified it.  I'm afraid to use this seemingly unknown oil on my skin or in my soaps.  I'll be trying to return it, but if unable, I have no idea what to do with it.  I won't be buying anything from Dr Adorable again.	2015-08-16

I was initially 'scared' of open comb DE razors, hearing/reading that open comb is more 'aggressive' then close comb razors.  Well, in reality the 'Openness' or 'Closeness' of a razor doesn't make it less or more aggressive, it's the razor gap and angle of the blade that determine a razor's aggressiveness level.  This razor is not aggressive, it is however efficient, more so then most of my comparable close comb razors, most notable when shaving my neck, always a problem area for me.  The open comb, allows the razor to get to the hairs without causing razor burn or irritation.	2015-08-16

For those of you who have seen the Breakfast Club, I was that weird girl in detention who could make it snow dandruff by simply rubbing my scalp. I had so many problems with scabbing, itching and flaking I thought the only logical explanation could be psoriasis. I tried all sorts of natural remedies such as the vinegar, baking soda and water solution to coconut and tea tree oils and all kinds of 'miracle shamoos' that simply did not work 100%. Maple Holistics has been god sent. The winter duo is my absolute favorite. Yes, you will smell like spearmint fresh out of the shower but once it dries, it quickly subsides so do not be concerned about that. I can get away with washing once every 3 days easily, well my hair that is anyways. I also highly recommend the dead sea mud mask and the silk 18 conditioner works just as well and has a lovely vanilla scent. I can now successfully mock the herbal essence commercials with execution thanks to Maple Holistics. Oh and did I mention the cost for this magic in a bottle can be all yours for about just $12. That equates to about $6 and some change each! What have you got to lose, dandruff?	2015-08-16

This is my second Parcelona clip, they both have easy to grasps tabs and claws that op en easily with just the right amount of springiness.<br /><br />I had seen the smaller version of this one on Amazon and finally came across the big one.  It measures 4&#34; as described.  I really like claws like this that have flat teeth, so that they rest against your head instead of sticking out even more.  The teeth are spaced fairly close and quite grippy.<br /><br />The only con is that the opening at both ends is narrower than I thought due to the design.  The space right above teeth is very small and my thick hair takes up a lot of space.  After placing the claw around my twist of hair, I have to squeeze the claw a bit more to make the twist narrower, so that more hair goes toward the tabs section of the clip.  That ensures that the teeth are firmly gripping hair as well.	2015-08-16

I found it's extremely easy to put on, the wig cap goes on your head first and you pull it down so it's around your neck, make sure the thick part is on the bottom, then pull the other side back over your head keeping the thick part at your forehead line, pulling all of the rest of your hair into the rest of the cap, And then you put the wig on.  The bangs are long but that's good because everyone's head is shaped differently so if you have a longer face the bangs might be just right for you where as for me they're pretty long and I may want to trim them a little bit. I love the length and color. It also comes with a little wig comb so you can comb it and keep it looking nice. It is a great wig for cosplay, Halloween, drag, role playing at home if you know what I mean, or just to go out with a change of hair. It's a very good quality wig and the wig cap not the wig makes my head itch. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a long purple Schlake the waves in the hair are fabulous and I love the way it looks on me.

This product performed the same.  I tried the Rosy 10,and also Bronzed  40, as well as Luminous 50.  For my pale skin I did like the Rosy the best.  It complements my skin tone and hair quite well.  It's easy to apply, just have your own blusher brush at the ready as this doesn't come with one.  It has lasted all day and even stayed on throughout a 9 hour work day followed by 3 hours of rock climbing.  It has staying power.  It is not as pigmented as some more expensive brands such as Nars, but I am OK with that.  The price difference makes up for that.  I can buy 6 packs of this blush for 1 Nars blush and have it cost the same (and if I don't like the color, I'm not out all of that cash.)	2015-08-16

I was excited to use this after having read all the positive reviews. However I was not happy using it. I have a teeth molded retainer so I used that to put this whitening gel in. First time I used it the gel got all over my mouth after putting in the retainer and it was awful! It was my fault (having accidentally putting too much in) but the fact that it had such a horrible bitter taste and tingly sensation was not enjoyable. It didn't stay long enough for me to see any results. Ok so round 2. I tried again a few days later carefully using a small amount, yet it still got out of the retainer from my saliva and the taste was back. That time it was in for almost 30 minutes. I think it may have made my teeth slightly whiter but I can't be sure. My teeth weren't very yellowed to begin with so I don't know. Overall I really did not enjoy using this product. I actually prefer whitening strips and toothpastes.	2015-08-16

I have been using Dove products for many years and they are a trusted brand in our house.  When it comes to deodorant, I am very picky. Let's face it, it's not something we want to have an epic fail with when we try a new product!  I was hesitant. I normally use either the Dove Clinical Protection or the Degree Clinical Protection deodorant.<br /><br />  The Advance Care Original Clean Dove Deodorant goes on clean and smooth - fresh smelling, nothing overpowering here. That's what I want. I don't want a fragrance to mask a smell! I don't want a smell to begin with!  I put the Advance Care to the test!<br /><br />  I have to admit, even on a summer day, it held its own. The only thing that I miss between this and the advance care is the application aspect. I miss the tiny holes that help break up the solid so that it goes on smoother. (See pics below for the comparison to show you what I mean)  Other than that, this won for price point, getting the job done and overall value!<br /><br />  Thanks Dove, you added another winner to the team!	2015-08-16

I never knew what a good pair of nail clippers was until I bought these.  When I needed a replacement this time around, I had a hard time finding any in the stores that had a hole for slipping them on my key ring.  I found some in Walmart, but they were the worst of the cheapo nail clippers ever.  Then I saw the Klipit set on Amazon.  As you feel the heft of the steel in your hand, the clippers proudly wear the brand logo inset in the substantial, sculpted lever.  The sharp precision-ground edges are impressive.  I love the diamond grit file built into the inside of the lever.  That was a bonus feature not even described on the Amazon page!  I never thought I would spend $24.00 on a set of clippers.  Frustration drove me to it, but these are so worth it.  I can proudly let them swing on my key fob an show them off!	2015-08-16

US	11319676	RMW1VCQZUDV3Y	B00FISJ0CI	275178620	Avon Jillian Dempsey Professional Perfect Contour Powder	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	For lighter skintones; I use it everyday!	I bought this contour palette when it was in an Outlet catalog, and I can't say enough about how lovely the texture and colors are. The brown is a perfect soft matte contour color for pale to light/medium skintones, and just as it looks, is almost a delicate milk chocolate shade-- and makes a beautiful sheer eye color base as well. The peach tone is soft, yet has a gentle vibrancy-- I have extremely pale skin with neutral undertones, and have never been able to wear orange-y peach tones well-- this is not orange-y, not pink peach, but more of a true peach tone. I have been wearing the matte brown virtually ever day since I got it, as a contour, mostly, but also as color, eyeshadow, or a soft liner.<br /><br /> The highlighter shade has the merest bit of fine soft glimmer-- it's almost really a matte like the other two, and works on top of either/both the other colors, and anywhere you want to bring a contouring glow without shimmery effect. I use it everyday as a final redness-hiding touch on my lower lashline, especially in the inner corner.<br /><br /> Suitable for all skin types, even dry (as mine is 3/4 of the year) when properly prepped. Wears nicely.	2015-08-16

The VOG (volcanic smog) is as bad or worst the smog in the big cities. So when I received this moisturizer free of charge to test  it and share my honest opinion I got a little excited. The main reason it appealed to me is that one of the main ingredients is Ellagic Acid which is the newest antioxidant I've read about it lately. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and although my wrinkles are not magically gone, because you know, it would be unrealistic to expect that, I did notice they are minimizing considerably. I also feel my skin more supple and tighter and let me say , super soft. My main concern was that my skin is kinda oily but this moisturizer doesn't leave any residues and I did not break out either. It works for me and I do recommend it.	2015-08-16

If you've had the Wahl clippers in the same price range you'll regret the purchase of this Oster trimmer.  You could run the Wahl's a long time with good trimming results.  I abused mine and got 4 good years out of them.  These Oster's get bogged down easily like the blade drive doesn't have much power behind it, once the blades start to heat up forget it.  The sizing combs are obnoxiously loud when installed and the clippers are on.  I'll probably never purchase Oster trimmers again, avoid these.	2015-08-16

I feel it has minimized my pores (although it may just be my imagination). As far as my wrinkles, I definitely think they are improved. They aren't gone by any means, but they do look better.

In the past, if someone gave me a moisturizer, I would use it in much the same way as this product. -- slather on in the shower, then rinse. It would help, but not a great deal since most of the product was rinsed off before absorption. However this product is lovely! Easy to apply over a moist body, quickly absorbs so skin is noticeably softer when rinsed and after drying. I always buy several bottles so I won't be without.	2015-08-16

Gentle Exfoliant With Natural Enzymes. Adds Essential Anti-Oxidants And Minerals For A Youthful, Smooth and Radiant Skin.	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Pampering your face within your own home.	This face masque has a unique smell that I cannot tell if I like it or not. I get like a cucumber like scent by then a straight up pill like smell. Like when you open Tylenol and you smell that powered smell being released. So in certain spots I get a sweet smell and than another I get a scent that I'm not fond of, at all. That doesn't effect the performance of the masque, just wanted to point that out. On the jar it states to put it on for 5 minutes or longer. I've been doing mine for about 8 minutes and that seems to be ideal for my skin. It has a lotion like consistency and a peach like color to it. Between the scent and the color, I wasn't expecting anything appealing to the eye or nose in the least. Though the smell is a hit or miss, it's not the worst smelling skincare product that I've used. I like that as soon as I remove it from my face I can instantly feel the difference from the before and after feel. My skin feels so much firmer and much more smooth to the touch. (My skin isn't rough feeling if I don't use this.) The smell does linger through the use of it and it seems to last around 30 minutes to an hour after I've taken it off, but it's more on a faint side once it's removed. When applying and taking it off I use a circular motion. I'm not sure if that makes a difference or not for the container just says to gently massage it onto the skin. The wet washcloth, to remove the masque, seems to be the best bet. No reason to make a huge mess as you continuously wet your hands and attempt to remove it from your face. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my unbiased review. My opinion was not influenced by the discount that I received.	2015-08-16

First let me be clear, I did not pay full price for this, I got a discount in order to test and review the product.  I am sure that makes you want to ignore everything I'm about to say, but please- don't.<br /><br />First, the product comes in a resealable package. That's pretty great because you can leave it in the shower and not worry about it getting wet or ruined. (You do have to make sure the track stays clear of grainy product or it takes a second to seal shut.)<br /><br />Now, on to the good stuff<br /><br />This is by far the single greatest scrub I have EVER used, and I have used A LOT.<br /><br />The smell is the most rich delicious smell I have encountered. Mine was coconut and I don't know how to describe the small of coffee and coconut (I don't even like coconut) but think of a morning on the beach with  your fresh coffee covered in coconut oil.  The grains consist of two types, the coffee grounds and the exfoliating ones.  They are mixed with an oil based product which makes sliding the product over your body less painful than some products I have had in the past which sort of felt like sandpaper.  When you rinse off your skin is so silky and shiny (the oil is like a really rich moisturizer that makes my skin have a natural shine and my legs look amazing...)<br /><br />The only issue I had was the first time I took a bath I came back the next morning to what looked like a beach in my bathtub, so make sure you rinse out after you are done.<br /><br />I would be happy to answer ANY questions you have, I have already gone through my first package (it lasted about 3.5 weeks of every day application and use on the heavy side because I was trying to test it, I would expect about a month or more) and have purchased my second at full price.<br /><br />I can't account for all the scents, but after this next package I am going to experiment and will update my review.	2015-08-16

[[ASIN:B00AUTKHHM Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover]] I bought it in October 2014, but last month, July 2015,  the bottom cap that holds the batteries in came off and fell apart. Consequently the device wouldn't function until I taped it shut.  I submitted a request for a replacement to ShaveNow (the seller) and was just sent an automated &#34;Expiration of returns period&#34;.  I paid $24.95 for this device and it lasted less than a year,  with pretty light use -  once or twice a month.  Since I had bought additional rollers I bought the updated version [[ASIN:B005XUNG5I Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover]], so that those wouldn't be a complete waste too.  I hope this one lasts longer.  I find the Amazon review program very useful,  but wish there was an automated mechanism that asked buyers to review the product's durability in a reasonable timeframe.	2015-08-16

FINALLY I'm seeing results.  It took a couple of months, but this brush along with Aqua Glycolic wash and cream has helped a lot.  I tried the Aqua Glycolic alone first and saw a slight improvement, so the brush is what really made the biggest difference.  The rough patches were almost gone when I broke it...and they began to return pretty quickly.  I contacted them per the instructions on the warranty and they shipped a new one the very next day!

I have always had thin fragile curly hair that was (and is) super porous-if you took a strand and pulled it between two fingers you could feel the &#34;bumps&#34; but my hair was always long and pretty manageable. TILL  my darn thirties and dying my little &#34;skunk&#34; patch and occasional gray here and there has left me with short hair due to breakage from coloring and oh so bummed. I didn't want short hair but I also didn't want gray hair. I had to choose between the two so I dye my grays!<br /><br />Just recently this product came into my life and it is my HG (holy grail) product! My hair is actually growing and my ringlets look beautiful again and not frizzy. I know i totally sound like a infomercial but I cant help it I am over the moon!

It's sleek and it's quiet. It's a bit heavier than my old Conair, but not so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold. In fact, it has a very nice, slim grip and I like the matte finish. My hair is indeed shinier, as promised. An unexpected extra is that it stays straighter, a real bonus in heat and humidity. I may never use the attachments (diffuser and focused stream) but it's nice to have them. I'm enjoying my new dryer and look forward to a long relationship.	2015-08-16

In fact, I've spent almost 3 times as much money just to purchase this specific brand. Here's why I like it:<br />The brush is very easy to use, even for someone who usually uses a pencil.<br />The first tube I tried lasted about 5 months, without any negative impact on the product. I wore it probably 4 times a week.<br />My favorite aspect of this makeup is that it lasts all day (which is saying a lot because my eyes tend to water for no reason) but it is extremely easy to remove with a regular towelette. I've even used coconut oil to remove it with no problem.<br />The glitter is not too excessive, just adds a little fun on the face.<br />Overall, I say definitely give it a try. You might just find your new favorite eyeliner.<br />Elizabeth Mott, will you make different colors of this? If so, sign me up!	2015-08-16

US	16716556	RQTOMDUGNOTPH	B007VDWDAY	153410879	Brights Semi Permanent Hair Color	Beauty	1	20	27	N	N	Horrible coverage and color!	I bleached my hair over a week ago and then last night I used three tubes of this product on my hair. I had two people helping me to make sure everything was covered and then left it in for over 40 minutes. When I washed it out it looked more like a blue-purple than an actual purple, but to my horror I found that nearly 50% of my hair wasn't purple. It left the un-purple parts of my hair a gray-brown color. I've dyed my hair many times, but never used this brand before and never will again.<br /><br />The day before I also used a natural dye by this brand on my boyfriend's sister and it also turned out horribly. I was supposed to be a natural blonde, but turned out orange. I should have returned all the purple I bought for myself after that!<br /><br />Horrible product, but here's the rest of the review all the same: Didn't have a bad smell, more like grape scented markers. Came as a thick paste that goes straight into your hair, which is convenient and low-mess; however, it makes it more tedious to apply than the more liquid types of dyes. Like with most dyes, keep a damp paper towel with dish soap on it nearby to easily wipe dye off skin to prevent unwanted dying.	2015-08-16

She absolutely loves this product, she can tell a significant difference from before to now.<br />She has used this product for about two weeks, her wrinkles are less noticeable and she feels like her face, neck and her eyes are firmer.  It pumps out just enough to use on her targeted areas. She loves that it does not have a heavy feel to it, and it goes on very easily.  It also does not have an overly intense smell to it either, it is very mild compared to other products she has tried in the past.  The only thing she dislikes about the product is that it is a little sticky feeling after applying to the face, but it becomes smooth and absorbs into the skin within 30 seconds to 1 minute.<br />From my point of view, I can see a difference in my mother's skin, ESPECIALLY her neck, which has been her biggest issue. Her skin looks and feels smoother, and the wrinkles are less noticeable.<br />My mother and I both highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for plastic surgery results without the cost and surgery.  This is a great price for amazing results.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a reduced cost to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and this review is of my own without any compensation from the provider.	2015-08-16

Every supplement, wash, herb, essential oil, cream... Antibiotics, retin-a, proactiv, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />This, like most everything, didn't do anything. I've had moderate to sever acne for over 10 years now and only three things have helped me personally:<br />1) Burdock root. For about a year, then I feel like my body may have gotten used to it or something.. I still take it on and off just for fun.<br />2) Papaya soap. For some crazy reason, I dunno.<br />3) and most importantly the acne org regimen. Please don't confuse this with products that make a profit, it's all about how you use whatever you choose<br /><br />The acne org regimen works wonders. Yes, months after trying these pads I spent some more of my time on google and finally checked out their site. It is more about the regimen itself than the products they sell and they even state that. It's about washing your face, twice a day for roughly 10 seconds (crazy, right?) then waiting 15 min to put on a 2.5 peroxide lotion, then 15 more and putting on a regular moisturizing lotion.<br /><br />Other tips that helped me... change your pillowcase daily or every other. Use a separate towel for your face and one for your body/hair. Drink enough water. And one you've heard 1000x over, don't touch your face.<br /><br />These wonder products are scams. A bunch of poor saps are paid hourly to leave reviews for products like these. It's sad because people like us suffered long enough then get screwed over and over and over hoping that something will work. Good luck, people!	2015-08-16

He's 11 now, but still likes the tear free products, so I thought I'd give this one a shot as he was tired of the &#34;watermelon&#34; smell of the last one he had.<br /><br />This one works alright, pretty much on par with the others.  It really is tear free, didn't bother his eyes when he tested that feature for me (after a hefty bribe of some extra video game time).  The smell is pleasant, not really identifiable as any one specific thing, and is less overwhelming than the watermelon smell in the other version we have. It's nice without being rude about it.<br /><br />Stands on its head just fine, but as with their other bottles I've had, the opening is a bit aggressive.  It's too easy for kids to squeeze the dickens out of it and end up with way more product than they'd need in a week.  I would've preferred something that had a slower flow.<br /><br />But it does a good job, lathers well and rinses out about as easy as any.  They just need to make the holes smaller.	2015-08-16

But then, the tip started flying off of the hose when under pressure, spraying water all over the bathroom and up my nose!  The tips and the hose fitting for them are plastic and I believe they have worn down enough over the 1.5 years to be strong enough to attach, but not strong enough to stay attached under pressure.  I would give it 5 stars for the first 1.5 years, but must now give it a 0, as it is unusable without replacing parts.  That averages the rating to 3 stars for me.	2015-08-16

The smell is not strong at all and I would even go as far to say there is no smell to this oil. Even if you add a little or lot more it just never gets to where you can fully smell the product. The very frustrating thing is there is not stopper in the bottle. It comes with some cheap plastic thing but who wants to store that? All other products some with some sort of stopper or flow control in the bottle. I have poured way to much not thinking this does not have one and to be very careful. I wouldn't suggest this product unfortunately.	2015-08-16

I didn't know what to expect when I used it for the first time, because I have never used an epilator before. I have to say I was surprised. It didn't hurt at all. It left my legs feeling soft and smooth. It easily removed the hair. The epilator has 2 settings.  High and low. I used the low setting because it was my first time using it.  Before using it I left it charge for hours.  After I was finished it was easy to clean.  It comes with a cleaning brush.  This was a lot easier then using a razor	2015-08-16

It's refreshing to feel the water droplets break and then transform into the shimmering color that lasts literally till the next day -- it's almost impossible to rub off/smear yet breaks down easily with an oil-based makeup remover/cleanser.<br /><br />Brown - shimmery neutral brown for all skin tones, similar to an Urban Decay shade, perfect for everyday or smoky eyes<br />Plum - shimmery pale lavender that works great as a lid wash<br />Champagne - light golden bone shimmer that works as a highlighter or every day natural shadow<br /><br />If you demand long-wear and &#34;bulletproof&#34; qualities in your makeup that will last in heat and sweat -- yet feels airy and light, then this is your potion.	2015-08-16

I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited when I found this eye shadow duo and was even more excited when it shipped and arrived earlier than expected! I didn't have any issues with shipping and it arrived all in one piece. The lighter of the shades is fairly light but it accents my eyes nicely ( I have blue eyes). When I first applied the darker shade it seemed a bit much but after it's all blended out it looks really nice. You could create a really nice smokey eye using these shadows. The shadows are nicely pigmented and stayed in place really well throughout the day. I never felt like I needed to reapply and I even got a couple of compliments on my makeup today!	2015-08-16

I was always taping my super short nails because of tears below the quick that kept snagging on things.  I had tried every nail oil and strengthening polish there is, well over $100 spent.  This stuff works! Anyway, three months of heavy use hasn't even depleted the oil in the pens by 50%.  So the price is a bargain.  I'm not even going to bother trying to refill them, I'll just order more pens whenever I run out.  They're definitely worth the money.  I'm ecstatic!	2015-08-16

I really like this brush! I have a son with long hair on top, and when i use a regular brush he complains how it hurts :( So I purchased this brush in hopes that it could help with painless hair brushing. IT WORKS! if you catch a tangle, brush that area again and it gone! I even use it on my hair! i usually dont brush my hair when its wet because it just breaks my hair, but this brush doesnt do that! My kids also love the mirror on the back of the brush head! Its great for traveling where you may not have access to a mirror. No more bad hair days!	2015-08-16

I've been using it for over four years, maybe five now, heck I was probably one of their first customers.  I wanted a deodorant that was free of aluminum and any other chemical I couldn't pronounce and also worked to control odor.  I looked into making my own deodorant, and would have probably tried that, but then I stumbled across Jungleman and was pleased to see this had the same ingredients as I would have used to make my own except I didn't have to go to the trouble.  I ordered it and found it to be extremely simple and effective for me and the rest is history.  There was a period of time a couple years ago when the product was not available (I think the owners were reevaluating their business or something).  I had used up my last stick and needed to reorder but couldn't find it.  So at that time I tried several other &#34;all natural&#34; deodorants from the health food store or online and I hated them all.  None of them ever came close to the odor control power of Jungleman.  After a couple months of using these terrible deodorants I again decided I was just going to have to try to make my own.  I tried one last search for Jungleman at the time and there it was, back on the market!  I ordered like 5 sticks at once and thanked the owners profusely for bringing it back.  They had changed their formula slightly (I could tell it was more oil and less dry) but it still worked great for me so I continue to be an avid supporter.  I am now ready to reorder once again and am happy to find Jungleman easily available on Amazon and I see they have more varieties available as well.  I hope they have not changed their original formula again as I loved it just the way it was!  If necessary I will post an update when my new stick arrives.  I love that you CAN be all natural and odor free at the same time!	2015-08-16

I usually use a honey type wax, always thinking that the cream style waxes wouldn't grab enough hair to do the job. Boy was I wrong. This product is terrific! I have very fine, blonde body hair, mainly from exclusively waxing and not shaving for the last two decades, so this may not be grabby enough for coarse hair, but it worked great for me. I like that it contains titanium dioxide and moisturizers, as it was really easy to see any left on my skin, and it was essentially painless. I prepped my legs with cornstarch based powder prior to waxing, and used natural muslin strips. I was not left with any sticky residue, clean up was a breeze with plain coconut oil, and I had no redness. This wax is fantastic, and such a great bargain. I also bought sample bags of the different hard waxes for bikini and underarms, and I can't wait to try them too. Thanks for a great product!	2015-08-16

I think it the micro silver that makes it work since I learned most big pimples are staph and hospitals use silver cream to treat staph infections on the skin. The probiotics also probably help since our skin uses them too. I used it with Clinique rosacea lotion at 1st to help with the redness. Does not however provide any anti-aging benefits but it clears up the skin without over drying it and dry skin does look older. May burn at 1st but if u increase the frequency of use gradually and use the right lotion with it, it isn't too bad and it goes away. I add a vitamin C serum underneath for anti-aging. I used 10% at 1st and now use 20% vit C serum daily and Elta MD Clear spf 46 for acne and redness prone skin.	2015-08-16

There are so many uses for Aloe Vera.  This is a great product to make sure you never run out of. This is great for your skin.  I have dry patches on my face.  But, my face is always oily.  The aloe vera balances it out. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. I don't have to worry about my face looking greasy after using this. I love that this product is 100% pure & natural. They also included a pump for easy dispensing. Great product	2015-08-16

I really love how it makes my hands feel really silky and smooth. I can't really do anything when these are on my hands, but they feel nice and I like relaxing with them. Also, the black heart on the outside actually turns red when the wax gets really hot. I used mine in the microwave, and it worked really well.<br /><br />They have a unique design, which is basically a plastic hand wrapper that has a spongy interior, and the sponge holds all of the paraffin wax so that it delivers it right to your hands. It also stays hot for a pretty long time, which surprised me that all the heat didn't dissipate really quickly.<br /><br />These are made for average hands, so if your hands are giant, then these might be hard to fit into. But, they should work pretty well for most hands. Also, they're great for the first treatment, but for subsequent treatments, it's really tough to keep the wax in the sleeve while microwaving.<br /><br />But, overall, they're awesome for disposable paraffin treatments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Makes your hands feel silky smooth<br />+The spongy interior absorbs and holds most of the wax<br />+The heat indicator really works<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May not last a full five treatments<br /><br />*TGN gave me this wax to review*	2015-08-16

I have severe dry skin and this cream helps keep it moisturized and from feeling parched.  However, I cannot use it because of the smell.  Some reviews said it has an ammonia smell.  I don't smell ammonia, just a stinky cream that takes many hours to dissipate.  The cream applies white, but takes awhile to rub in the skin even though it is not thick. I also noted it is sticky, which can be annoying.	2015-08-16

The straightener is awesome too, way better than the other two that I own. I purchased this mainly for the curling irons not the straightener.<br />I just got the set about two weeks ago. I went on a week long business trip and have curly hair it can be a pain to style when I am travelling. I used the straightener and you couldn't tell my hair was naturally curly, it was pin straight. I used the curling iron and it was easy to use, I didn't have to keep the iron in my hair that long to get the curls. My hair was shiny and beautiful I got a lot of compliments.<br />Hopefully it lasts a long time!	2015-08-16

I decided to return to the old school style of shaving since I wasn't very pleased with the amount of $ I was spending monthly on razors, plus i am military and required to shave EVERY day. The razor was versatile, well crafted of quality steel and a great price. The price for 5 razors at target are $3.50, the blades are well crafted( made in Deutschland of course!) and I couldn't get a better shave. These razors actually shave you- new razor heads currently in the market pull and then cut the hairs on your beard leaving ingrown hairs, cuts and razor burn. I recommend using the weight of the head while shaving for momentum and always rinse it off in warm water and towel dry the razor . I highly recommend this product and its well worth its investment of $30! you wil save at least $200= a years in newer style razor blades that just wear out and cost $17 for 5 blades.	2015-08-16

It's impossible to get product out of this bottle after it's been used for awhile for two reasons.  The bottle is too stiff to squeeze.  The product is too thick to pour out of the container. I wind up having to bash the bottom of the bottle to get it to flow towards<br />the opening....or I have to take off the cap and slam the bottle against the side of my (clean) sink so some of the lotion lands in the sink and<br />then I can use my hand to grab a decent amount of product....so I can apply it to my skin.  I find this process of using the product very frustrating<br /><br />....this to be oxymoron packaging....although I love Ancient Minerals Magnesium lotion....It helps me sleep well and helps with muscular aches and pains...<br />BUT I cannot give a manufacturer high ratings if I'm frustrated using their product.	2015-08-16

After I blow dry,  it looks like I have twice as much.  I found if I used any kind of smoothing product (that tames the frizzes) after it was washed and before I dried it, I lost a LOT of the body.  It smells good and although some reviewers said they got suds, I don't care how many times I reapplied it, I got nada.  It looks like watery white lotion and that's what it felt like I was rubbing into my hair.  I didn't have to use a conditioner afterward and my head and hair felt clean BUT it felt like there was some kind of 'film' on my hair to where I couldn't stand to touch it.  So I washed my hair again, first with my regular shampoo, then applied this and waited the 2 to 3 minutes and it felt much better.	2015-08-16

No Harmful Toxic Chemicals. 2 Bar Set. By Christina Moss Naturals.	Beauty	5	0	1	N	Y	"Maybe It Should be Called Something Other than \"Soap\"!"	This product delivers such a gentle, thorough cleansing, maybe it should be called something other than &#34;soap&#34;! It lathers easily in soft microscopic bubbles that glide onto the skin and provide deep clean without stripping or irritating surface skin. It's called &#34;body soap&#34; but I also used it on my face and loved the result. After cleansing, the skin feels dewy soft and moisturized as well as really clean, almost as if no additional lotion or moisturizer is needed - although I am looking forward to the soon to come Christina Moss body lotion. I really like that the soap isn't fragranced, another reason maybe it should be called something other than &#34;soap&#34; - because almost every soap on the market has added fragrance (even if it's a so-called &#34;natural&#34; fragrance); this soap doesn't, there is absolutely NO added scent!

Due to thyroid ussues, it is also VERY dry, brittle and falling. I have THICK wavy hair yet the strands are not thick. Doing this was a last option before chopping my long hair  (mid back lenght). I'm also challenged in all thing beauty (don't know how to apply makeup,  do my eyebrows or different hairstyles if you get my drift.) I have had 2 professional keratins before and loved the result but don't have that kind of money anymore.  Here is how it went for me: First of all it took me a good 3.5 hours (did I mention I was all-things-beauty challenged?) But I didn't want to rush and loose my money or worse, end up bald. The claryfying shampoo left me looking like a tumbleweed. My hair was so dry after that shampoo it was rough to the touch. I almost shaved my head at the point. I blow dried, detangled and got to it. I did wear gloves but didn't have a &#34;coloring brush thingy&#34;. I went to my backdoor porch. I was expecting to suffocate and my eyes to burn. My experience was the it actually smells good (like coconut vanilla yogurt). I had done the back part of my hair with no smell. However, the closer I got to my face was when I felt the fumes people speak of on the reviews but since I was outside at 8 am, it was bearable and it didn't take me long to finish at that point since it was only the sides and top of my hair.  While straightening, the smell got better. There was a lot of smoke coming out of my hair and by now I was doubting if I was doing all of this right and if it was worth it. When I finished my hair felt a bit &#34;waxy&#34; but also soft and was pin straight and shiny. I was beyond happy with the results. I hadnt been that hapoy with my hair in a long time. I'm on day 2. I will update on what happens after I wash.  Would I buy again? Probably. The results are great, my hair is not frizzy or looks dry anymore and it's not even falling off. And I still have a half bottle even with my thick hair!!! I'mexpecting it won't last me the full 4-6 months I get out of the salon version because my hair wasn't as bad as it was at this point. But if I can get at least 2 months out of it,  it's worth the time and &#34;trouble&#34;. I did end up with some aching arms and shoulders but if I did this successfully, anyone (and I do mean ANYONE) can do this! Hope this helps someone.	2015-08-16

Majorly disappointed because these had such great reviews, even people saying that you don't need to use the full treatment and can whiten in a minimal three days. After 6 days, I don't see any difference except on my upper front two teeth there are white spots.  The packaging says these are normal and will go away in a few hours, but they've been there since the first day.<br />That being said, I don't think it has a bad taste. They did stay on well but for me weren't too hard to get off at all. I've had 2 random bursts of sensitivity/pain on two different teeth (bottom teeth), but it was like a 5 second thing.	2015-08-16

The provide very good UVA/UVB protection. This also has antioxidants.  US sunscreens don't have these superior ingredients.  Zinc is also good, but it breaks me out. If you are looking for a  non-mineral suncreen that his highly stable but doesn't have avobenzone, this is a good option.  Avobenzone is a good UVA sunscreen, ,but it must be stabalized and the mineral sunscreens in make up can make it less stable.  This has no avobezone, so I can wear this with a makeup with sunscreen (most have SPF) and not worry.  This is best for those with dry skin.  If you use the full amount it feels like you are putting on a lot of light cream.  I end up looking wet for a bit but then it settles down. It doesn't feel like nothing. It ends up feeling like a light coating of moisturizer, which I like with dry skin. Also lets me know it's still there. I don't want to be greasy though and don't with this. No fragrance or white cast. Gentle and effective.  Might not suit oily types, or people who hate the feeling of anything on their skin or want something mattifying might prefer something else. .  Pretty tenacious too.  I feel protected walking around in summer with this, but I still wear hats and take care.	2015-08-16

I bought this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo because my hair was experiencing a lot more fallout than my usual shedding. I used it for two months, and while I liked the way it didn't over-dry my hair when washing, it didn't really do that much in the way of stopping the fallout. In fact, I think it made it worse as I would pull clumps of hair out of my shower drain with every use - more so than when I used just the shampoo alone. I did notice that my hair's texture was much softer and bouncier than before, and I believe that it did do a good bit in the way of balancing the pH of my scalp, but those are the only positive effects of using this product that I experienced. I didn't mind the smell either, although it is quite strong. I've since stopped using this product and returned to my regular washing routine. It just didn't work for me.	2015-08-16

Within a week it went from a gorgeous deep violet to a pastel purple just from regular showers and color safe shampoo (barely using any to conserve the color). Was expecting it to last longer. Also...BLEACH YOUR HAIR AS LIGHT AS YOU CAN GO. First time, I bleached to a few shades above platinum blonde and is already showing through.	2015-08-16

I like these earrings.  I read in a review that the posts are very long, but I bought it anyway.  Yup, they are long.  I wear them daily and now make a routine of taking them off before I go to sleep.  I wish they were a bit shorter so I could sleep with them on like I did with the other pair I wore daily.  I really like the design on the side, which most people can't notice, but it adds a special touch.  I also read that these would be good as &#34;second-hole&#34; earrings.  I would disagree.  Maybe I am just not the flashy type, but these are definitely &#34;first-hole&#34; earrings for me!	2015-08-16

Holy Frijoles that was some sale ( I believe as an add on maybe? Going to check)!<br /><br />Bottom Line: Totally worth 3 to 5 dollars. 18.00? A laughable ripoff. It's okay costume jewelry. The gift box may earn you extra points despite the earrings -wink-.<br />TOTALLY WORTH what I paid for it :)<br />I removed one star for quality.

After purchasing this ring for my mother and sister, (to match my ring), I have since ordered more for others on my gift-giving lists.  It looks great on the middle finger, however, I think it would look great on any finger, perhaps even a thumb ring.  It is really a great ring and you really cannot go wrong with the price!!  An added bonus, it arrived within 3-4 days of my order!!  I will definitely keep this in mind for those that I  give gifts!!  UPDATE 9/19/2015...I bought yet another ring!!  In addition to myself, I have bought this ring for my Mom, my Sister, and my Best Friend!!!  They ALL love it!!!

It fit very loosely on my finger so much that I thought it would slide out on its own. But it never did. Remember I said I'm not use to wearing rings? Well, I lost it already. I plan on ordering this one again but in a smaller size because I do love the &#34;true love waits&#34; saying on the outside. It's just a healthy reminder to remember that God is perfect and He loves me so much that whatever He has in store for me, will be good. I pretended to be at the altar and said some vows to God to remain pure until I'm married and when I felt like I said it with my heart, I put on the ring. I only take it off when I'm about to wash my hands or go to sleep (I leave it on the end table). Well, I washed my hands either in the kitchen or the bathroom...I can't find it! Now I feel naked without it. But, buy also a ring case for it just to put it up when you take it off. I hope I find it.	2015-08-16

I should have reviewed this sooner, I'm sorry to the designer/maker I did not. The communication was fanatastic... and the lady that  makes these rushed it for me as I had bought it for my son.... and was leaving to visit him for the 4th of July.  The necklace is second to none IMHO, its simply awesome.... great workmenship, top quality, and looks great.  My son has a new sail boat and he loved this necklace.  I highly recommend this necklace...!	2015-08-16

The picture doesn't do them justice. They are a deep and gorgeous purple and an abundance of stone makes the tree look bountiful and full. As earrings, they were slightly larger than I enjoy wearing, so I removed the hook, attached one of my simple gold chains through the loop, which naturally faces the right way for it to lay on my chest, and made one into a necklace. I gave the other one to a dear and close friend who simply loved it. I wear it all the time now, and when I am out and about in the world, women comment on how beautiful it is. I get at least one comment on it every day. It is a simple, stunning, elegant piece of jewelry.  I will be purchasing more as gifts for dear friends.	2015-08-16

I had never heard of knuckle rings before I learned about them through this review opportunity. They are what they say they are...rings that fit on your knuckles! This set that I received came with 4 silver rings and 4 brass rings.<br /><br />The rings come in different sizes so some/most of them are sure to probably fit on at least some fingers! I was able to fit each of the 8 rings on all of my fingers. Depending on what fingers I used them on, some of them fell off of my fingers because they were too loose, while others stayed securely on my fingers.

[[VIDEOID:6526f3f63f8e50652b8891c3059b6813]]This is a lovely ring that is extremely shiny and includes round cz stones all around the ring.  It is classy enough to wear out on a date but casual enough to wear with jeans.  I rated this ring 4 stars purely because of comfort level when wearing.  The ring is rather thick and as such I am constantly aware I am wearing it.  The ridges of the ring are higher than the inside, making it appear hollow.  I would have preferred a design where the inside of the ring lays flat against my finger.  If designs such as this do not bother you then I am sure you will love this ring.<br /><br />Ring received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.	2015-08-16

Let me start by just saying that I received a discount to purchase these earrings for a review.<br /><br />I am completely dissatisfied with the shipping time. Even though thy came from China, they still took longer to arrive than the alloted scheduled time. When I did finally receive them they came in a small unprotected envelope. You would think that coming from so far the seller would at least put them in a small box to keep them from becoming damaged.<br /><br />The earrings themselves are beautiful, and shiny for the most part aside from the fact that a couple stones were in the package, and not attached to the earrings where they should be.<br /><br />I still chose to wear them out inspite of the being slightly damaged, and still have received complements for how beautiful they are. They are also very comfortable, I have slept in them, and I don't wake up with pain on the sides of my head.<br /><br />So overall I'm ok with my order aside from the above stated issues.	2015-08-16

I would define it as a ring with understated elegance, and would be appropriate to wear with any outfit.  It came in a beautiful white leather box and as such would be completely appropriate for gift giving.<br /><br />I wore the ring before reviewing to make sure it did not irritate my skin or rub off during extended wear and I was excited to find the ring durable, comfortable and non allergenic.<br /><br />Great ring!<br /><br />Ring received to test with the option to review.

I bought this mostly for the novelty and aesthetics.<br /><br />It is attractive, even when you get to see the real thing. I've gotten a few compliments about it, which tells you just how eye-catching that little shiny bit on the end is. The ball does occasionally get caught on things inside of my bag and come out. This is best remedied by laying the book down in a container directly on its spine. Straight up will mostly work.

When the Mikiy women's fashion alloy diamond butterfly necklace arrived it was so pretty! The color I received was pink/green which is perfect for my daughter since she is pink fanatic. The crystal in this butterfly necklace was so well cut that it looked like a much more expensive piece of jewelry. The colors were vivid as well, which I personally enjoyed seeing. The necklace is very delicate looking, however, it is sturdy enough that I felt very comfortable giving it to my four year old to wear. Seeing, as how she is not the most gentle creature when it comes to jewelry, I would have expected this chain to break in a few minutes, as her more expensive ones have. However, it has held up to her antics thus far. I see no reason why she won't be able to enjoy this necklace for a good time to come.<br /> I did receive this Mikiy Diamond Butterfly necklace for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. However, with that being said I can honestly say that the review is indeed based upon my own personal experience with the butterfly necklace.	2015-08-16

Recently I went overseas and decided to bring it along. I felt energetic and less tired. Even when I am tired, it seem to fade quickly. My negative emotions are greatly reduced when wearing it. I found myself easily brushing aside jealousies, anger or annoyance. Joys and laughter came more easily to me. I like it very very much. Tq for enabling us to meet.<br /><br />I bought other stone bracelets and some are not very suitable for me. Mind you, it's not the bracelets fault. Some are just not suitable for me. I have weak constituents and body, so some stronger stone, I find them to be to strong and overwhelming for me. For example, I was greatly taken by the healing properties of black tourmaline and decided to buy it. Apparently it was too strong for me, i have great headaches when I put it on.<br /><br />Bloodstone I bought because it is a March birthstone, apparently it is not suitable for me. For me it seem that intuition seem to be more accurate, which stone felt right then it is the one for me.<br /><br />That's all I suppose. Forgive the poor English. English is not my mother language or even my second language, I can't truly express what I want to say. Once again thank you for the sugilite bracelet, I like it.	2015-08-16

I saw this charm and knew that this would be a perfect way to remember her.<br /><br />The paw prints are detailed and the charm itself is very shiny and smooth.  I have a Pandora metal bracelet and a cheaper leather bracelet.  The charm easily slides onto both of my bracelet options.  I have received a lot of compliments about the charm.  I also purchased a silver chain necklace and plan on wearing it as a charm necklace for variety.<br /><br />During the day, I look down and see her charm and it makes me smile.	2015-08-16

When I saw this one I had to get it for him. I dare say this one is better than the original! The Tungsten is quite a bit heavier than stainless steel, which gives it a sturdier look and feel.

These earrings are absolutely lovely. Plus, they can be worn two different ways. They can be worn as a pair of small pearl studs, as they have a rubber backing that's very secure, or they can be worn as they are in the photo showing these earrings. When worn as shown, they are VERY unique. They're sturdy, don't need to be babied. Hands down, I would recommend these to anyone that doesn't want what everyone else is wearing. They are not heavy. They are actually so light, you forget you're even wearing them.	2015-08-16

This Babeyond Charm Rhinestones Crystal Chain Link Double Ring is certainly a beautiful and unique piece. I love that the rings are adjustable so no one should have any problems at all wearing them. The rose design is gorgeous and each rhinestone is placed very beautifully and accurately. Whenever the light touches any of the rhinestones in the right spot it sparkles which definitely makes your hand stand out! I've worn this ring a couple times now since I got it and I haven't had any problems with anything breaking,falling off,or any skin irritations or discoloration. The chain that connects the finger ring and the thumb ring together is a little short for my not so normal sized hand but it's not overly short to where I can't wear it; it just gives a little tug and reminds me that it's still there and to not pull overly hard. You could definitely wear this double ring for any occasion rather formal or casual! This would be a great gift idea unless it's too pretty for you to give away (like I did lol). I would definitely recommend this Babeyond Charm Rhinestones Crystal Chain Link Double Ring!<br /><br />**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**	2015-08-16

First things first, this is not the ring for you if you want it in any sort of a hurry- Shipping took quiet a while on this one. Now, the ring itself is very nice. It came in very minimal packaging. I nearly lost it in my purse before getting it home. I had my husband try it on and unfortunately, it was too big. I ordered his regular size and this one was just too big. That part is disappointing to me because my husband hasn't been able to wear a wedding band for a majority of our marriage and I was really hoping this one would be the one he could wear. He liked it but it just didn't fit. To ship it back to China would be such a hassle that I am just going to pass it along to a friend. Still on the look for the right size ring.	2015-08-16

Not really sure about this one just yet, while it is a very pretty ring the gold color is not as shiny as I would like could be due to the fact that it is stainless steel and not actual 10 or 14 karat etc. Hopefully it doesn't turn I'll give it a couple of weeks and come back with an update, Non-the-less ring looks just as pictured.	2015-08-16

Does not look ANYTHING like the picture. The size is completely off. The necklace itself is huge with the gold bar being ridiculously gaudy. It is the cheapest material ever. I have never been so disappointed from a purchase.  EDIT: As you can see in the picture, the necklace fits diagonally on a 8.5x11&#34; sheet of paper. The gold chain is entirely different from the one shown in the picture. The actual size of the bar and pendant looks as if it ate the ones in the seller's picture.  As I am highly disappointed, the seller only offers a &#34;partial&#34; refund. I wish I could give this a 0 star is possible.	2015-08-16

I wore them for a few hours with no irritation. I was nervous when I took them out of the package because they felt heavy but I didn't notice that they were weighing me down while I was wearing them. They're very pretty but I wouldn't wear them as an everyday piece. They're also larger than I thought they would be. The curve sits close to a good cm below my nipple. From top to bottom they're the size of a 50 cent piece.The picture shows how large it is in comparison to a beer bottle top as well.	2015-08-16

I have small ankles so I wasn't too worried if this would fit. It came on time. Shiny and light to wear. The only minor issue was it wasn't a clasp bracelet. It had some kind of weird part thing that the only way I could keep it from coming off was weaving it through. I'm not sure if this was what it should have had on the bracelet from the get go or I got a bad bracelet  but I had to keep tabs on it because I had to always retighten it. Eventually after about 2 weeks  I noticed it was off my ankle and I found the weird part had literally broken off the bracelet and was on the floor with my bracelet somewhere else on the floor. Unless I could get a clasp on it it's useless right now to wear which is a shame because I loved it. Should have had a clasp on it from the get it.	2015-08-16

The pale peachy pink color and flowers just make it nice and feminine.  I like how it is bold without being bright.  I was surprised when I took it out of the package because it is very light weight. I was glad because of the size I was expecting it to be heavy but that was not the case.  It lays right at you collarbone so it is a good length for several necklines. I think it would be especially pretty with a sundress or even a pair of jean and a crisp white button up shirt.  This is a good inexpensive piece of trendy jewelry, anyone with a love of feminine pieces would enjoy wearing this.<br />I purchased this necklace at a reduced rate in return for an honest and unbiased review. I have based my review on my own opinion and experience of the floral necklace.	2015-08-16

Yes it is pewter, and I wore it 24/7 before it broke. I bought it at Spencer's or Hot Topic, I can't remember. It's a lovely piece and well worth the price. One of the edges became to sharp and that's why I replaced it. I lost the beaded jewel on it shortly after purchasing it, but it never bothered me that it was lost. I just began a quest of finding a new jewel to replace it with. But I never found a &#34;perfect match&#34;. I would highly recommend this. If you would like I can take pictures of the one I have to share. It still looks brand new, and has a sharp wing (the reason I replaced it).

It did take about a month to arrive. However, it did arrive before the actual due date.

The necklace does look very delicate in my opinion so I'm extremely careful with it. Overall, I think it's cute and the price is good.	2015-08-16

I own several origami owl pieces. Unfortunately I dropped one losing the birthday boy figure that represented my youngest son. When I went to the origami owl site to replace it I could no longer find them, so I came to Amazon. I was very hesitant to buy from a different vendor since it was going to be in a locket with authentic origami owl pieces but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think anyone would be able to tell which one was the replacement, if they were asked. I'm so glad I found this product I won't be hesitant to buy again.	2015-08-16

It has a lot of weight to it.  (It's not *too* heavy, I think, but it is heavy.  On the other hand, it doesn't flop around at all!)  When they say one of the materials is shell, that is pretty easy to believe.  The simulated pearls almost fooled me at first -- they have a slightly irregular shape and I initially thought they were actual (dyed) freshwater pearls.  At any rate, I feel like the materials are high quality.<br /><br />Another thing to note: although this is a multistrand necklace, it didn't tangle up at all during shipping or while I was wearing it.  (I was a little worried because of all the knotted threads, but there was no need to be worried.)<br /><br />The clasp on mine was a little difficult to undo.  It's a toggle clasp but it's made of some stone material and it doesn't have a lot of give.  However, I was able to get the necklace on and off -- without assistance from someone else.<br /><br />This is a very summery sort of look.  Reminds me of a resort or seaside vacation!  I think you'd want a fairly plain or neutral top to wear it with because it does have a lot going on.<br /><br />Overall, though, I was impressed with the quality of the materials and the lack of tangles.<br /><br />Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.	2015-08-16

Ok so first of all, the colors on the necklace are true to the picture if not prettier, it came with a nice chain too (I'll put a picture) the only reason it got 4 stars was because the middle circle is a bit cheaply made, and doesn't really hang in the center of the moon, it was also a bit bigger than expected but with that being said I think for the price it is good quality and a very nice buy.	2015-08-16

I ordered 2 so I could pair them with my engagement ring because, as much as I love my engagement ring, the accompanying bands just don't have any pizzazz. My engagement ring is platinum but, right now, my money is better spent on different things than to replace perfectly good (boring) rings with more expensive rings.<br />The picture seems to show a more &#34;solid&#34;/thicker ring but these are more dainty and the gems are very tiny but I love the the product more than I loved the picture of the product.<br />If you like wide bands, I suggest buying 2 and either pairing them up (crown to crown) for a filigree style band. If you like extra wide wedding sets (and can handle slightly sharp tips in between your fingers), place them crown out for a stunning wedding ring set. These are eternity bands so the design goes all the way around the ring. The crown tip you see in the picture is repeated 2 more times for a total of 3 crown tips.<br />If these are truly sterling silver .925 (I'll let you know in a few days, if they aren't, because I'm severely allergic to base metals.), they are worth more than what I paid for them. Even though the cubic zirconias are so small, the rings are shiny and truly stunning.<br /><br />The only reason I'm including this next information is because someone else's review said these run small. Typically, I wear a size 9 but I swell so much that I buy everything in 10-11. That way, I never have a problem getting a ring off. I'm not sure how it happened but I ended up ordering 12s. It's not the fault of the seller. I made sure to look and I did, indeed, order 12s. I'm not going to return them though. I may just order another set in a smaller size. I have to say, these do NOT run small. I compared them to several size 11 rings and they're bigger (which they should be since they're 12s). They also fan out, slightly, at the top edges of the crowns so that makes them feel even larger.	2015-08-16

It also has a welcome note inside, which I thought was a nice touch. The product is also surrounded by a plastic packet.<br /><br />From a quality perspective, it's a good quality product that's made of alloy and crystal. It's relatively heavy and admittedly is a large sized broach. Width = 5.4cm / 2.12\\\", Length = 5.2cm / 2.04\\\\\".<br /><br />The design on this is antique, classic and art nouveau with a marquise-shape combining circular and leaf shaped stones. I really like the bling on this along with the good detailing and the broach is easy to pin on.<br /><br />I personally found that it's suitable to wear in a formal setting such as a wedding (as a guest) or to an important event. It goes well with a really smart dress of any colour to be honest."	2015-08-16

It's my fault, not the seller or Amazon or whatever. These plugs are perfect though. I can have some color but nothing too ridiculous for work and these give just that. One plug fits in my ear but my problem lobe, no way not yet. From what I can tell it was very light weight and won't irritate your neck while sleeping. All in all these are great plugs and I would totally recommend it to someone looking for double flared plugs ;)	2015-08-16

It looks just like the picture-- a delicate, sparkly design that can go with many looks.  I don't own any other rose gold jewelry and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like the color of this piece.<br /><br />Cons: I don't like that some of the stones in the bottom part of the design have a white look to them, which makes it look cheaper.  It depends on how the light catches them, as to how they look.  I would also like the chain to be a bit longer, but that's easily remedied with a chair extender.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was given this necklace for free via the Amazon Vine reviewer program in exchange for posting my honest opinion here.	2015-08-16

It has some strings for tightening (you won't need to do that!) and untightening but it's so tight itself I can't seem to undo it. Even my girlfriend who is much handier at these things than me was unable to loosen it. Maybe it's just the specific item I ordered that's so tight. Maybe it's supposed to be this way and I shouldn't have ordered it. It's a fairly attractive bracelet, although I was honestly hoping for prettier, but the tightness really makes it tough.	2015-08-16

My daughter does a  home sales business and lot of people at her last convention had on chunky jewelry.  She had mentioned she really wanted to get some chunky jewelry to amp up her look for shows etc.  When I saw this bracelet, I immediately thought of her and what she was looking to do with her style.  It comes with an adorable bag that has a draw string.  It was not in the bag when it arrived the bag was seperate but I really liked that because it is going to allow me to put some of the extra confetti like stuff in the bag with it to give to my daughter as a gift.  There are very specific cleaning and care instructions on the listing for this item.  I highly recommend you use them if you purchase this bracelet.  I did notice that someone had posted previously that they had an issue with the color running.  I think that is probably why the instructions are listed.  In case you can not find them they are below:<br />Tips to Maintain your accessories:<br />1) Avoid direct contact with heat, or expose under the sun.<br />2) Before showering, take out the accessories and keep it in a safe place.<br />3) Avoid solvents or chemicals like perfume or soap. Dry it with a clean towel if gets wet.<br />4) Clean in a secure location, not the rim of a sink where a piece may slip down the drain.<br />5) Use only a soft brush, never sharp or hard objects, to remove dirt or particles.<br /><br />Keep in mind items that you may use like perfume etc may have alcohol or other agents in it to 'scent' the perfume and may create issues with any jewelry you put on.  I try to make sure my perfume has had time to dry before putting anything on where I have applied it.<br /><br />Overall the bracelet is gorgeous.  It is also very sturdy and I am very happy with my purchase as well as the superfast shipping speed!<br /><br />I did recieve a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review, however, as I am typing this, I do notice the pricing I paid is the same as the sale price listed for the public.  I don't know if that will change but I did want to make sure anyone reading my review was aware of that.sted for the public.

I really love this anklet. The charms on it are very nice. I knocked off one star because after wearing it one day, one of the butterflies was missing.

I bought this necklace for a young 13 year old girl with Down's Syndrome that has had so many health struggles in her life, that I wanted to give her something meaningful. I work with her mom, and she was telling me how her daughter loved dolphins. They go to San Diego every year so she can swim with the dolphins. I wanted a design that was simple, but elegant. I loved the chain because I felt it was sturdier than a common silver chain. When the necklace arrived, I was beyond impressed. Simple, stunning, sturdy, lovely.The gift box was nice too. She said &#34;This is jewelry, isn't it?&#34; She loved it!. She even wanted to wear it to school. Small expense for big payoff. Thank you! Would order again in a minute. In fact I may get one for myself.	2015-08-16

Tickled to death to receive my coal!<br /><br />The authenification certificate came upside down in the packaging (Weird).

(If you prop it as in their photo, the package is actually open and 'leaning' on the back of the case. ).<br /><br />In my case, I chose to swap the certificate (originally facing forward) with the mini NY Newspaper enclosed (originally facing backwards.)

I bought this ring as a test, to check the quality before getting another one for my wife, to work as as a daily replacement for our gold weeding rings, that can be used in an more daily basis. I really like the overal finish of the material, I'm a perfect 12 fit, so that never been a problem buying online under that number.<br />The inner polish is very good and that accounts for a very comfortable wearing. The weight is just right, not to heavy that becomes a hassle to wear, not to light to have a flimsy / cheap sensation. In overal, seems like a piece I will love to war over the years. My life love it and we will made a purchase for one matching her size soon enough.	2015-08-16

It also has a welcome note inside, which I thought was a nice touch. The product is also surrounded by a plastic packet.<br /><br />From a quality perspective, it's made of high quality material with the materials in question being mainly brass metal and cubic zirconia. It's definitely lightweight and medium sized. Length = 19.5cm / 7.6\\\",  Width = 1.2cm / 0.5\\\\\", Weight = 18g.<br /><br />The design on this is modern, classic and vintage and there are about 70 clear diamant&eacute;s in a wave shape, dotted between the waves are the navy, 18 blue stones.  I really like the sparkle / bling that this creates. I also like the blue colour and how smooth it feels on the wrist.<br /><br />I found that this is more ideal to wear in a formal setting for a special event or art gallery opening for example. This goes well with a smart dress or nice blouse with chinos and a skirt of a darker blue colour, black, silver or white."	2015-08-16

This ring is perfect! It was expected to come in the mail between August 13 and August 19. It came in August 14th and i was shocked it came in so quickly. It looks like it will last a long time and made out of good material. The day I got it, i fell asleep with it on, worked a 12 hour shift, which included washing dishes, and it didn't even turn my finger the slightest bit of green whereas a cheap ring from Claire's would turn my finger green in a couple hours after wearing it. This ring is very convenient, especially for such a low price.	2015-08-16

I believe these are nipple rings being marketed as nose rings.

It also has a welcome note inside, which I thought was a nice touch. The product is also surrounded by a plastic packet.<br /><br />From a quality perspective it's made of good quality material with the materials in question being rhinestone and alloy. Admittedly, it's a heavy necklace and is large sized. Chain Length = 42cm / 16.53\\\" to 48cm / 18.89\\\\\"), Pendant Size = 19cm / 7.48\\\\\") X 11cm / 4.33\\\\\". Total weight = 135g.<br /><br />The design is modern, art deco and glamorous and whilst the stones are peacock blue in colour, there are 2 clear stones on top. There are a number of oval stones and these vary in size, cascading down the neckline.  This is an extendable necklace which is always a bonus. The clasp on the necklace is a lobsters claw.<br /><br />I really like the blue colour on this necklace and I also like the number of stones that it has. I personally found that this was suitable to wear in a formal setting such as a special event or going out for an important dinner. This goes well with a low cut top or dress of a black, white or peacock blue colour."	2015-08-16

I have had these earrings since November 2013 and I never take them off. They're simple, pretty, and never bother my ears! I started to get itchy ears from 14kt gold so I went on a search for hypoallergenic earrings and was pleasantly surprised that stainless steel is totally inexpensive! Decided to give these a try because they were and still are such a great deal. I use the middle 3 sizes because the smallest is too small and &#34;sink&#34; into the holes while the big ones are a little too big for my liking. Even for 3 pairs, I think this is a great price. Highly recommended earrings if you react to other metals and want simple, cute, and long-lasting posts!	2015-08-16

This shoe is super cute and I love the look of the back- it goes up higher than normal.  However, the back rubbed horribly and I had to put on a bandaid before I even left the house!

The leather doesn't seem or feel like leather, but I love the texture, grey-black (close  up) color and the fact it is probably water resistant.  The zipper is great and is easy to open, as is the inner side zipper pocket.  I would have rated it a 5 star except that the material is not stiff enough to carry items I need without obvious &#34;dents&#34; or almost puckering of the ends of the purse when it is 1/2 or really full.  After it is emptied, however, the original shape reappears.  I really like it, BUT: I was hoping to use this as both an everyday-use purse and a semi-formal occasion purse, but would not re-order because of the structural issue described.  Hopefully M Kors will someday sell a purse with this design and size using either a different material or with some structural feature that prevents the puckering and bulging.	2015-08-16

Bought a pair of these sandals in Mushroom color in size 9 wide width.  Disappointment when I wore these sandals at the pool, at the beach.  Living in Central Florida, summer lasts April - Mid - October, it get hot and humid.  Its season to spend time at the pool, at the beach.  Sandals are must have foot wear.  This type, style of Crocs sandals were a disappointment for me.  The color was ugly.  The sandals are cheaply made of plastic molded one piece thong glued to a white sole that is painful to the soles of my feet.  The white peebled raised designs on the sandals soles are little hard plastic &#34;dots,&#34; hurt as my feet pressed onto the soles.  No massaging action - hurts almost like walking bare footed on tiny real peebles.  Bottom soles are hard plastic wedge design with basic plastic formed tread on bottom.  These sandals are not slip proof!<br />Poor design, cheap materials, cheap construction, uncomfortable for average woman's feet, fit isn't consistent with other shoe fit sizes.  Materials, construction, fit, won't last a normal summer's wear.<br />If you want to torture your feet then go ahead and buy a pair of these cheap sandals, also you are wasting your money & closet space.	2015-08-16

They have a unique design to them that is made to move with you without hindering your activity. The sides of the sunglasses that are normally hugging your face near your temples are out a little further than they would be normally giving you added room and comfort, yet the pivot style arms ensure a snug fit that keeps the glasses securely in place and prevents slipping.<br />The lens is a dark smoke with a mirrored finish that reflects a bluish purplish tint to it.  It is a single lens that wraps around and gives complete coverage and protection from sun and dust during your favorite outdoor sports. The bottom of the lens is contoured with the curves of your cheeks. The nosepiece is made up of two separate rubberized pieces.  Overall these glasses are well made and have a stylish look to them.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-16

Won't be mistaken for a pair of Common Projects, but neither will the price. The leather is stiff and requires some break-in, but they're wearable. Perhaps the biggest weakness is what's on the inside. The sockliner is made of a flimsy piece of cloth that is in no way bound to the footbed. While in most shoes this is not a problem, this piece represents the only solid platform for the foot. The footbed itself is sort of like a honeycomb of hollow rubber with a supporting 'grid.' After a few days wearing these shoes, the heel started caving in and the sockliner fell apart. I may try a pair of store-bought insoles, but odds are these shoes are heading for the garbage long before I expected they would. Disappointing only begins to describe it. If you're after a pair of decent minimal leather sneakers, do yourself a favor and keep looking. You'll find better construction at your local Payless (at a much lower price). In the $50 price range, just pick up a new pair of Stan Smiths.	2015-08-16

I've had them a few years and I expected them to feel broken in by now, but every time I wear them, it's like they're brand new.

Maybe they want to save money with less material?	Somewhat decent item but again Isotoner clearly can't figure out a shoe size if their life depended on it. Not as small as the other pair I purchased and I can at least wear a thin sock with these versus barefoot all the time that can really stink them up. Maybe over time they will stretch but it'll likely take a while. I guess I'll wear my old ones until that happens. Quality is ok but I wouldn't want to pay retail for them either as fair retail if you ask me is around $30 tops not $44 as marked as the suede may be real but looks no better than the fake stuff and likely will be harder to maintain. I'm returning the other ones I purchased with these and will try the last ones that fit well by them. That will be a defining moment when I know they changed the sizing or manufacturing. Of course if I find they did I'll let everyone know and amazon will get them back for the larger size and I'll try again.	2015-08-16

US	1106671	R2JXX4747SDYX3	B00E802YKW	407712345	Dunham Men's Lawrence Steel Toe Boot	Shoes	4	1	1	N	N	A full year walking in my shoes.	I just hit the one year mark wearing these boots. I am tempted to buy them again but not for the comfort factor. I still think this boot is the best looking steel toe work shoe I have seen and I've looked at a lot of them. Style and weight are the main reasons why I purchased it a year ago. Even though this is a higher topped shoe, it is considerably lighter than a Timberland low-top shoe I had previous to this one (The Titan).  And that is a contributing factor of why I would purchase it again this year. The other reason I am considering it again is durability. The stitching, leather and everything about it on the upper has held up well...really well. I think the sole has a little more wear on the heel than I would expect but it hasn't fallen apart, worn down so much that is smooth/slick, started &#34;flapping&#34; or anything like that. In other words, if the upper would get me a couple years, which I think it would, it is doubtful the sole would.  As far as comfort? These boots are not really comfortable. To be fair, there are very few shoes I find comfortable, so part of that is me and part of it is the shoe. There seemed to be a couple of hot spots in the foot bed. I knew this going in and knew I would need to put an orthotic in the boot—which I did—a $30.00 orthodtic. This made the comfort level tolerable.  Another thing to consider, depending on where you live is: This is a hot boot. I live in SW Florida, so hot boot is not necessarily a good thing. All waterproof work boots may be hot, I don't know. I know I appreciated the warmth of the boot this past winter but haven't been too fond of it this summer. As far as waterPROOF goes, I don't think so. It is very water resistant but not waterproof. I have spilled/poured water a couple of times right on the area where the tongue begins and got a wet-ish foot. I have no complaints with their waterproof claim, however,  when it comes to walking through puddles, wet grass, etc. They perform well there.  I get a boot allowance from work of $100.00 per year (or as needed). If I didn't get that, I doubt very much that I would have bought this boot, considering I have to add the orthodic just to make it comfortable. Again, some of this dissatisfaction is probably me. Will I buy it again? Probably not this year since I since I have a considerable amount of life left in them. I cleaned them up and oiled them yesterday and they still look pretty dang good. I think this year I will go with a Keen brand shoe that I tried and liked. It is a low shoe-type steel toe. I wanted to have a lighter shoe that I can wear the times when I have inside work and have these boots for rougher outside type work. I would say I work 50/50 inside/outside. If the Keens hold up well this year, I will probably buy these Dunhams again next year to try and maintain a couple pairs of shoes to switch off with. If they were more comfortable, lighter, cooler and closer to a hundred bucks, I would buy them right now!	2015-08-16

Fit is true to size although heel is a little wide. (However, I have this issue with other shoes so maybe my heel is just a little narrow?)<br /><br />BUT I am exchanging them because the right slipper has the shearling insert stop or is completely matted down about an inch away from the toe. This is not the case in the left slipper.<br /><br />I am exchanging because I love the idea of these slippers. I don't fold them down so that my ankles stay warm, always an issue with my other pricier shearling slippers. Will update my review upon receiving the second pair.	2015-08-16

I wear mine 5-6 says a week all day doing flooring installations. Everything else I tried would last a few months at most,so they are quite a step up,with first pair lasting right at a year. The only reason for getting new pair now,was cause of lace loop be e breaking on one of them. The only problem I have with the keens is their insoles do not have a lot of cushion,and seem to flatten out pretty quickly,but then I'm not on my feet as much as my knees.:)	2015-08-16

I bought these about 3 days before leaving for a hiking trip in Colorado and Wyoming.  Tried them out on a 5 miler and they were great and then did 17 miles up and back down a mountain trail in Grand Teton National Park and felt great!  It even poured down rain on the way down and the traction was fantastic and I was the only one in my group with completely dry feet.  I would highly recommend these shoes.  I had zero blisters without ever having to break them in.  Definitely order a size up though.	2015-08-16

I feel like as if I'm walking on on pillows!  Two years ago when I trained for a walking race, I went to the local recommended athletic shoe store, only to be sold the worst shoes imaginable.  I have pes planus (flat feet) as well as stage IV chondromalacia in both knees, so knew I needed the correct shoe/arch support to avoid further problems. But even with my &#34;preventative&#34; approach, within weeks, I developed plantar fasciitis,  The condition is no longer present, but this year, I've gone and done my own research, and I am happy with my choice.  The widened/box toe area gives me enough space to spread/fan out all my toes comfortably!  I tell my patients that shoes on your feet are alot like the tires on your car, so choosing wisely and knowing what is needed can make all the difference in avoiding foot, knee or back pain!  Granted, I wear these shoes for walking, not running. so take that into consideration. If I had one preference, it would be to have a little bit more ankle support.  All I know is, I have no plans to ever need foot or knee surgery!!  I will be looking into the Hoka One One brand next.	2015-08-16

They are super comfortable flip-flop type sandals. I normally wear an 8.5 medium and I decided to go with the size 8. They fit perfect! My feet do not overhang the shoe and the bands still fits comfortably around my feet and ankles. I've worn these all day in the classroom without issue! They do not have a lot of support and fit like a typical flip-flop with just a little extra Sanku cushion. Love look and style of these shoes!

I am IN LOVE with my new boots!! I was so worried they wouldn't fit but I risked it and ordered my actual size which is 5.5 and they fit PERFECTLY! I was also worried after reading some reviews about the zipper getting stuck so I tested mine and it DID but there is a reason for it I bet none of the other people noticed. They actually made them to stop about halfway down. Why? I don't know. But you can easily see the stitch across the zipper to stop it from going down further. I added a picture of it. So that is NOT a stuck zipper or a mistake in manufacturing as both my boots are like that. It opens plenty enough to put in my cards and keys. Anyways, I can't give a good enough review for these. I'm going to wear them everywhere no matter how hot it is. Buy these if you're a boot lover you will NOT regret it!!!	2015-08-16

This purchase ended up being a disappointment. While the purse closely resembled it's online photo, there were many defects. The material felt thin and rather rough along the edges and seams. It smelled horrible like some animal died or possibly urine. The wrist and shoulder strap were nearly impossible to attach because the metal hook was so stiff. I ended up returing this product because the shoulder strap was a completely different color than the purse. It obviously belonged to a different purse. The only positive of this purchase was how nicely the purse was packaged.	2015-08-16

Try it again in rainy weather yesterday, and find it horribly slippery when I stepped on wet rock - I go hiking almost every weekend, and am fine in all weather basically; yet I have never encountered such slip with other shoes before.  I won't recommend it to newbies but personally, I will keep trying it to learn to improve my stepping skills :)<br />Perhaps the shoes have been produced for a few years, so the rubber has already been deteriorating and the toe tip of my right shoe got slightly worn out after wearing it for a whole day in the first time.  Provided the relatively cheap price, it is not bad to give it a try - also a good lesson to pick trail running shoes next time.	2015-08-16

I like these shoes, they are comfortable and I can easily walk on the city streets in them. However, the plastic/rubber piece on the bottom of the left heel fell off within the first 2 wears and the nail is now exposed leaving me with an annoying clicking sound when I walk and I need to get the shoe repaired.  Hopefully this is a one-off, but be warned the quality may not be that which we expect of Tahari.	2015-08-16

I've bought several over the years and have been very happy with them. Wishing you equally good luck and positive athletic experiences.	2015-08-16

I've had good experiences with some men's Asics in a medium width, but I liked the looks of this women's shoe so much that I decided to try it.  I do love the looks, but alas, the D size isn't a true wide, which I can usually wear:  while the size-9 length of these fits me well, both the toe box and midsection are so narrow that the shoe is too snug even with thin socks.  They are extremely breathable because they're mesh, but because of that I'm not sure they'd stretch enough even with a professional stretcher to be wearable with crew socks, and they'd be quite uncomfortable to work out in.  Correction:  I got these in a size 9.5.  So even though I'm normally a size 9, that would be way too tight in this shoe.  Also, perhaps because they're all-mesh, they don't offer as much stability and cushioning as most of the Asics I've had, which is surprising, considering that on another website the manufacturers says they're &#34;Built for mild to moderate overpronator who requires a blend of enhanced cushioning and stability.&#34;  I didn't notice either one.  I would have loved to be able to keep these shoes, but I'll have to return them and either go back to wearing men's sneakers or find something in a true wide.  PROS: Beautiful shoe, good price, looks great if you can wear it. CONS:  Not a true wide even if labeled &#34;D&#34;; less cushioning and compensation for pronation than some descriptions indicate.	2015-08-16

These shoes are great!<br />They look exactly like they do online. LISTEN UP TO ANYONE THAT READS THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS!!! Before I bought the shoes I kept seeing reviews about the size being to big which made me a little skeptical about buying them. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: take a pair of your old shoes and on the tongue of most shoes it will say the cm size. For example, my Nikes are size 11 and are 29cm in length. But the Polo shoes I bought are size 10.5 and 29cm in length. So to get the right size find out the cm size of some shoes that fit you comfortably and refer to the size chart to find the right fit for you. If you do that you will get a shoe that looks great and fits great!	2015-08-16

I've gone through FOUR pairs of shoes in an attempt to get a pair that has the soles of the forefoot and heel on the same plane.  I wear orthotics so that my feet strike the ground without twisting.  With these shoes the forefoot's sole is not always on the same plane as the heel's.  Your heel strikes the ground and then your foot twists (noticeably) to accommodate the forefoot's different sole plane.<br /><br />On some shoes it was the left foot, on others it was the right foot.  New Balance used to be a brand that you could trust to be built properly.  I'm sad to say that after 15 plus years as a customer I'm going to have to find another brand to wear.<br /><br />One last comment.

I decided to give these a try. Now I can hike 6+ hours and my arches don't hurt and I have less blisters. Plus these hold up to wear and tear. These are now my go to for my hiking boots.

But they are soooo hurtful! I first wore these to dinner and to walk around the museum for 2 hours, and my feet hurt but I just thought they needed breaking in. The time after that I wore them to work - I'm not on my feet all day, and I just do moderate walking between desks/cafeteria/bathroom. Ouch! The back of my ankles were bleeding from the shoes rubbing against them the whole day, and I almost died on my walk home by the end of the day. Still not giving up (maybe thinking that after wearing them all day they might have finally been broken in), I wore them and walked to the park (~0.5 mi). They were still uncomfortable and I felt the back of my ankles starting to get raw again... Thank God I brought flip flops to prepare for this scenario. Never again!	2015-08-16

Since I wear size 5, the pitch is very steep for me, and therefore makes walking for longer periods of time a painful prospect. Size down with this shoe, because your foot will slide into the toebox. If you find that there is still some space at the heel when you walk, pack the toebox with tissue paper. If your foot has a lot of back-and-forth wiggle room, the shoe has a tendency to slide on and off as you walk in them. The sides are also cut low, so those with wider feet may have a problem.	2015-08-16

US	52784884	R25CTIZICLLTJT	B00C4XH1OO	912766631	UGG Australia Women's Marsalis Platform Shoes	Shoes	3	1	1	N	Y	The Paradox of Shoes: Soft but Hard. (read on...)	I have other UGG platforms and these do not rise to the standard. Although they have shearling from the arch forward of the insoles, there is no padding underneath that, so the inside is fuzzy, but hard like wood... which makes no sense. There is no shearling around the inside of the upper - which I didn't expect anyhow. They are hard to walk in because of a wierd curve in the hard, narrow sole - so strides not smoooth, rather rolling forward onto the ball of your foot is clunky and unnatural. The toe box is somewhat narrow, so if you have wide toes these may not be the best choice for you.	2015-08-16

The most comfortable flip flops ever! When I first put these on, the fit was very odd. Like some reviewers noted, the toe bed of this flip flop seems to have quite a bit of extra room, while the heel has none. My initial reaction was to return these due to the fit but I decided to wear them for a day & see how they felt. After a single day of use, my foot fit much better into the toe area and after two days they fit just like a perfect, normal fit. I think because of the extra &#34;mush&#34;, things just take a little time to settle. Allow the mush to form to your feet. Once that happens, these fit like a dream!  I have a pair of Skechers Luxe Foam sandals that I swear by - have loved them & worn them out - .... and these put those to shame.  5 stars!	2015-08-16

Someone posted that these boots run way big. Please do not smoke dope prior to posting here. That is totally untrue. I have a size 10 foot. Period. I ordered size 10 and they fit like a glove right now. In one or two weeks they will expand a little and be some of the most comfortable boots I own. Once again...... I hunt for a living. Seriously. To feed my family. And it's a rather large one. Heck I run mountains all day in these. They ROCK!!!	2015-08-16

I've gotten a LOT of compliments on them and they go great with all my casual summer outfits so I've actually worn them just about every day for the past 3 weeks! With that much wear, the inside foot lining has lifted from the shoe a bit (as a few reviewers warned) but, they're still in great shape. And, I've worn them for hours at a time with no discomfort.

There is no way I would increase the size I bought, because then the back of the shoes would slip off my heels while walking.  The Bad:  I understand why some people might not keep these shoes.  They are a bear to get on.  I had to use a long shoe horn and really push my feet into the shoes.  Right out of the box, the leather uppers are extremely tight across my instep and the insoles of the shoes are harder than I expected them to be.  Final Note:  I am keeping these shoes because they so look nice, are made well and  were value priced when I purchased them.  I think they will break in and loosen up to conform to my feet and work out just fine for me.  Eventually, I hope to be able to wear regular socks with them to add extra cushion and warmth in cold weather.	2015-08-16

Other than that they are great. I usually wear 8.5 and my foot is on the narrow side and I purchased these in an 8 and they fit perfect. Good toe and heal cushion. I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse and often walk 7 miles in one shift. I previously ordered the running shoe version of this to replace my old ones and the quality was poor. The toe was pulling away from the sole out of the box. These appear to have better construction and flexibility. I have been trying on shoes for 6 months, seriously, and these feel great.	2015-08-16

There is supposedly some kind of fancy technology in these boots, but it didn't work for me. By the end of the day, I was taking them off and wearing my slippers around the office just to go get a drink of water. It's not like they're painful or anything - it's just that &#34;I want to walk like a normal person now&#34; feeling you get after wearing shoes that aren't right for your feet for a while.<br /><br />I put some ball-of-foot cushions in mine so that hopefully these can still be my go-to Fall booties as I was expecting they would be.<br /><br />The sole is rubber, but a very solid, inflexible kind that probably contributes to the less-than-stellar comfort. Maybe people who wear stilettos all the time are the ones saying these are so comfortable, but I'm all about comfort, so these were an unpleasant surprise on my feet.	2015-08-16

After reading mixed reviews i'm surprised that I really like these shoes.  I am flat-footed & have issues with my feet so i'm kinda picky about shoes. I normally only wear select brands of shoes that I know work for me.  I bought a few other cute looking cheap no-brand-name shoes on Amazon & the others all got sent back for one reason or another.  I honestly fully expected these shoes to have something wrong with them (look cheap-o, make my feet hurt by pressing on my bunions or rubbing blisters on my heels, have super slick soles or a funky smell, etc.)  but i am happy to report that they are totally normal & really cute!<br /><br />I bought them in Aqua and it is a beautiful color. The materials seem to be good quality, although there are these weird little round &#34;plugs&#34; on the soles (see my pics). Fortunately they do not affect how the shoes feel or cause any problems. The soles are flat, no arch (which i prefer) but there is a bit of cushioning to the insoles (which i also prefer) so they are pretty comfy.  If i still worked in retail pulling 8+ hr. shifts on my feet i probably wouldn't wear them, however for normal everyday wear they are great. I can run errands around town or wear them to my current job as a part-time nanny with no problem. :)<br /><br />As for the fit, the length is ok but they seem a bit wide. I thought about returning them to go down 1/2 a size so they would fit snugger, but my usual size 8 in women's fits me fairly well length-wise and i feared that the 7.5 might not be long enough. So i kept the 8's.  If I leave them loosely laced they feel sloppy, but as long as I pull the laces tight enough they are fine. I am actually thinking about getting a few other pairs in other colors.	2015-08-16

I can throw in added inserts if my feet are tired but the ones in them suffice. The only thing that kind of sucks is I got them wet on an approach and when they dried the toe area shrunk a little so now they are a little snug. I used to wear Evolve Cruzers  but they dont seem to get many miles on them before they look tired and are not as comfortable, these have been put through the ringer and are still comfy and look good. Great price, great shoe, happy with this purchase!	2015-08-16

The quality is a lot better and the glasses seem more authentic. The RB engraving is now regular. Also I actually just bought another pair at sunglasses hut, and I found that indeed all the cases have this little pocket in between...which I find weird but doesn't actually negatively affect the case's function. It seems like the case color is random as well I received a brown this time when I exchanged it.  ****Next Day Update : 2 stars So actually I looked a bit closer and the RB engraving seems off. The letters aren't etched with equal weight. The center of the B has a white spot thats actually pretty visible and distracting. I also noticed small nicks on the bottom of the frames. I am going to return this pair for an exchange and update my review when I get them ****** Original 3 Stars I ordered the RB2132 New Wayfarer 710/51 52-18 2N from Vision Group, fulfilled by Amazon.  On the RB website these retail for $140.  The box I received was had wrinkles in each corner. For SOME reason they had to put the Amazon bar code ON the RB Serial Information on the box. I had to peel it to make sure that this was the right model. Of course the sticker destroyed most of it, but I could make out a 2N 710/51 and 52 so I guess it's the right one.  The contents of the box include the glasses with 1 sleeve of plastic on 1 temples (not both or together), 1 black case with a gold seal, 1 RB cloth, and 1 RB Manufacturer's note.  The cloth I got seems to be a little bit off, the zig-zag cut pattern is not even on all sides and the redness of the logo seems a dark magenta red vs. the cherry red seen on the box/booklet/website.  The case I got is okay. The gold seal is shiny, but it seems like some of the gold print was scratched off on the inner ring. The WORST part seems to be that the case may be coming apart.  The glasses, however based on my comparison to a few youtube videos seem authentic. All small details are present and they have a good feel.	2015-08-16

These are not problems I normally have with shoes.  The color was slightly lighter than shown on my computer screen, which I could live with.

Only problem is, no half sizes for people with over size 8 feet. I was caught in the middle; 28 was far too small and 29 was too big, floppy and insecure. So, I returned mine... Good to remember that these fit like gloves, so it's important to use their size chart and select a size close to your own foot measurement. Otherwise great shoe, sole is so flexible that if I hold the shoe with the sole parallel to the ground it will droop towards the floor. If you're a minimalist runner/enthusiast you know this is a very good thing. The sole has a very high percentage of rubber and traction is extremely good, no excessive wear but, because of the composition of the sole I avoid too much use on pavement for the pair I kept(29). Putting the shoe on is not complicated or difficult; you start from the bottom and hook the metal tabs(kohaze) to whichever line of string is the most comfortable for you. It's a good idea to flex your foot up while hooking the kohaze as it makes it easier. I recommend getting injinji or tabi socks(non-kohaze) to go with these so you can avoid dirtying the white linen inside. The shoes are not waterproof so keep that in mind, the canvas  upper is tough though. All in all great shoe, if they had half sizes they would be perfect and would get my repeat business. At their best they are nimble, light durable and cool looking minimalist shoes, try them, I recommend it!!	2015-08-16

Pointed toe shoes can be tricky because they are either too wide or WAY too narrow and they smash your toes on top of each other.  Crocs did an amazing job in proving enough room for your does to be flat and now squished together but still keeping the pointed toe sleek look.  I would recommend these to anyone.  The fact that you can wash these in the washing machine is reason enough to buy them!	2015-08-16

I have had these glasses for a little over two years and I can't wait for a different frame to come!<br />Why? Because no matter what I do, these things just slip down my nose, and if I bend over, off they go, on the ground.<br />I used those little foam things you slip on the ends for awhile, and they helped a little bit.<br />But over all, the design is flawed, the ears need more down bend to hold them up, especially since they are a big frame (i had the XL size).<br />Live and learn, while these glasses look great, the constant slipping is not worth it. Hope my new Ray Ban frames do better.	2015-08-16

These are a more refined version, so they seem to fit in a middle category between sneaker and dressier shoe/sandal i.e., good for errands, shopping, sightseeing.  Haven't really worn them all day.  I was going to send them back, but they really are a cute shoe.  They are more outdoorsy-looking, so they seem to work best with that type of clothing; denim skirt, walking shorts etc.  I am trusting that they will be as comfortable as my original Tevas.	2015-08-16

Normally wear size 11 in brands such as Nike, Vans, Sperry and most other major brands. I decided to go with a 10 since they are &#34;leather&#34; or at least a material able to stretch and stay on tight as my job requires nice attire with the occasional running between offices at a moments notice. Opened the box to see the fresh pair (was worried they might be used or a returned pair) and slipped them right on with my dress socks, not sure if comfortable for thicker socks but I would think that might've pushed the envelope. All in all, a fantastic deal and some good looking shoes.	2015-08-16

I also own a pair of Cole Haan Lunargrands and these are pretty close at less than half the price (if you catch a good sale).<br /><br />Both shoes are freakishly comfortable, but I would give the slight nod to the Mark Nasons for feeling little more comfortable. I think they just molded better to my feet.  However, after a year of wear you can tell the leather used is of lesser quality.  I would not by any means say these are cheaply made, but they don't &#34;wear&#34; as well as my Cole Haans.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely snatch up another pair if it went on sale.  At full price -- maybe not.	2015-08-16

They do not have amazing arch support, but then again I have pretty high arches! I would definitely recommend these shoes, oh and consider possibly going a half size up if you want to wear socks - they feel the tiniest bit snug on my bare-feet.	2015-08-16

It took 3 pairs to find the right size, as I don't typically wear a wide shoe, but I do have a high arch.  The only issue I have with them and assume it will go away as the boots break in is a bit of a hot spot on the top of both of my feet after wearing them for over 6 hours. But I do have a very high arch so my guess is I am the exception and not the rule.  Otherwise they are a great alternative to Romeos which I could not get into at all.	2015-08-16

I am NOT one of those people who spend hundreds of dollars of sunglasses. As a matter of fact this could be the most expensive pair I have ever bought. That being said, I see no reason to spend more. These are perfect. They are well constructed, look great, come with a nice sturdy case, and cleaning cloth. So far I have really enjoyed them. At first I thought the nose piece would be uncomfortable, but that has turned out not to be the case. It actually lets the glasses ride off my nose and face, which makes me much cooler when I am outdoors.<br />All in all I think they are a good buy, and would recommend for someone wanting well built, dark, and comfortable glasses with out spending a lot of money. Shipping was also faster than I thought. They came relativity fast.	2015-08-16

The three colors received were not as pictured in the product item photo though - received solid black, a transparent medium pinkish red and a transparent golden tortoise shell. Don't get me wrong, I like the colors but it would have been helpful to know what they were when ordering. Frames measure 1/4&#34; on side bars, lens frame is 2&#34; wide across and 1&#34; vertical. Comfortable to wear, great price so I can keep pairs wherever needed. Just to be as accurate as possible, the title for this product reads &#34;Classic Reader&#34; but the inside of the side bar of the actual glasses reads &#34;Optx Tradition&#34;.  I have previously ordered several packs of 2.0 in Classic Reader and I thought I was ordering the same exact pairs in 2.5 [tough getting old]. However, the Tradition is a little thicker on the side bar at 1/4&#34; while the Classic Reader is 1/8&#34;. The frame around the lens is also just a bit thicker on the Tradition. The glasses seem to be a carbon copy of the Classic Reader just overall a tad thicker and therefore sturdier, an improvement.	2015-08-16

I suppose that advice isn't always accurate. Mine were just a tad large. No worries though (I kept the shoe instead of returning for a smaller size). So far the shoe has been great. After wearing them a bit, I figured that if I were to go with the normal size I usually go with, and were to ever wear thick socks with it, it would be too small. This is the reason I haven't bothered returning the product. 2 months later, of non-stop normal wear, and I'm pretty impressed with it. I've taken them on light hikes here and there and the shoes have held up remarkably well. I do want to mention that the traction isn't meant for wet slippery rocks (most hiking shoes/boots aren't anyway), but regardless of that fact, they did a somewhat decent job in that environment.  It does get a 'little' warm, but nothing I couldn't handle, as the breathability of the shoe was good. It wasn't awesome. It wasn't poor. It was just... good. If the breathability was a little better, I would probably give it 5 stars.	2015-08-16

BOTH sandals broke within 1 week of each other and only after 2 months of use. In the pictures you can see where they both broke and on the bottom you can see how I hardly wore them.  Don't get me wrong, I love these sandals -- while they lasted. Which unfortunately was only a few months. I got them at the beginning of June and now about 2 months later the toe strap has already broken. I am an occasional summer wearer of sandals -- nothing extraordinary and no particularly rough periods with them. Sandals like this simply should last longer.    Very disappointed. Oh, by the way, they're wonderful sandals, minus the construction of the strap -- everything else was great.	2015-08-16

I needed to replace a pair of keen's steel toed shoes from last year and thought i would give this pair a try. I normally wear an 8.5W and that's what i ordered and they fit perfectly! the last pair of keen's i had (keen's utility flint low) needed to be broken in to fit comfortably. but this pair fits great with a comfortable amount of room in the shoe. best of all, no more tying shoes!!! they come with the plastic tab that lets you control how tight they are. Another winner for me as i end up having to re-ty my laces several times a day at work... also noticed the back part of the heel in these shoes is not the cheap foamy stuff that every other shoe I've ever owned has. don't know what it is, but it looks nice, like it's not going to rip apart after a few months and give you blisters on your heels. if they turn out to be horrible, i will repost with an update. if not i will be buying another pair!  update 10/13/15 so overall i have to get another pair of shoes. I love the fact that you dont have to tie laces on these but they are killing my feet! the right shoe for some reason pinches my pinkie toe. the left shoe rubs my heel funny so i had to buy blister prevention patches which work. but i cannot wear shoes that cram and pinch my feet to the point where i hurt after only having them on for 3 hours.... i was really hopeful with these, but they are just going to be an extra pair in the back of the closet in case of a shoe emergency.........	2015-08-16

Just got it and tried it on. Love it. Bonus feature is that the back strap has an elastic pull that makes it easy to slip on and off the sandal. Extremely stable for the amount of lift. It's more like 4.5&#34; rather than 4&#34;. The shoes are SUPER light weight, seems like foam and air, so it was surprising how stable they felt. I'm pretty sure I can dance in these for hours and run in them too. The deep grooves in the tread do make me think that pebbles will annoyingly get stuck in there and scratch and drag and potentially lead to its demise. For now, what an EXCELLENT value for great height, snug and comfy feel. Platforms have lots of vertical surfaces to get scratched up though, so I'll be back to comment on how it wears over time. But I'm already considering a 2nd pair.	2015-08-16

I was in desperate need of new sneakers and 3 tries over the last 2 months with Nikes netted nothing. Decided to give Ryka another try after 13 years. This cross trainer has fantastic cushioning, I feel like I'm Jazzercising on air. So surprised and so very happy! A few reviews stated they ran into a problem with narrowness, but I didn't have this problem. I'm a medium width 9.5 in regular shoes, Nike's and Puma's, and ordered a 9.5 in these. They're a little too long (fixed by an insert) and I think a size 9 would have been fine. All around great shoe and plan to order another pair before they disappear or they change the style.  Providing an update as I've bought a second pair in silver. You'd think that wouldn't make a difference but it appears it does. Still great cushioning, however the sizing is off. Bought another 9.5 and this shoe runs tight. Totally weird.	2015-08-16

The print is adorable, and the shoe fits like a glove.  I ordered a half size lower, as recommended, and they're great.  My one foot is slightly smaller than the other so the one shoe is slightly more snug, but they'll stretch a little.  It's definitely more affordable than Tom's, and I feel like a better bang for my buck. I'm also very happy about the year of water.  The undersole is slippery, which could turn some people off, but walk carefully until they're broken in and you'll be fine.  I'll definitely get another pair when I wear these out!	2015-08-16

(I posted a similar review elsewhere before I found this page--sorry!)<br /><br />I have owned these for nearly six months, but bought them from a local shop instead of Amazon.  Trying on shoes is extremely important to me.<br /><br />I chose these shoes in size 9 wide.  I generally feel I need wides in all styles to accommodate my slightly larger right foot. If it helps the reader to know, I would be fine with medium-width shoes if my feet 'matched'.  Also, I have high arches, the 'Egyptian' toe alignment, and a very slight hammertoe on the right foot due to wearing ill-fitting shoes all my life.<br /><br />I would not say I have 'problem feet', but there are enough problems to make shoe-shopping an annoyance. That is why I am so impressed with these shoes, which were the most comfortable out of at least a dozen athletic styles I tried on, many also Nikes.<br /><br />I have been deeply satisfied with these shoes for my purpose of fitness training.  I am lightfooted and bouncy when I wear them.  The mesh panels feel cool when I need them to, but my feet don't get wet if there's rain on my way to or from the gym.  I live in a rainy area!  (I wouldn't test this in a serious deluge, or in puddles. It IS mesh.)<br /><br />Also, the grey and green colour scheme is cute.  The green is a sweet minty shade (but greener than shown in the photo) which matches a lot of activewear I've found locally. I love the ability to base many attractive outfits on my shoes.<br /><br />I walk a short distance to the gym and do my daily workout ranging from cardio to weightlifting, and sometimes I shoot hoops or do a similar activity.  These shoes have me fully comfortable and supported throughout. It can be a bit dicey when my feet swell from extended activity or hormonal stuff, but only because of the aforementioned larger size of my right foot. This is rarely a problem, though. If I wanted to have perfect comfort 24/7 in any shoes, I would have to get them custom-made. For an off-the-rack product, the Nike Flex Experience Run 3 in size 9 wide has been most excellent. I intend to buy another pair to replace the current shoes when they've worn out, which I do not anticipate happening for a long time.  They seem durable and well-constructed.<br /><br />I do not recommend paying over $65 for these shoes if you can find them near your home. I think I paid $60 for them, and 60-65 is the most common range I see for this style and colour, locally and online.  Your experience may vary, of course.  Regardless, this is the best athletic shoe I have ever tried!k product, the Nike Flex Experience Run 3 in size 9 wide has been most excellent.

They are more of a fashion cowboy boot, so if you're looking for a pair of boots you can go stomping around on the farm or rodeo with, these may not be the boots for you. It's not the sturdiest boot made,( when you tap on the heel you can hear it is hollow), but that is to be expected from a moderately priced boot. I bought these for my daughter who is a true size 8, and I got an 8 1/2 since I know she'll wear socks with them. Without socks, they were just a tad bit big, with regular socks, they fit nicely.<br /><br />On another note, when I first removed the boots from the box, it had a very strong smell. I got the tan colored boots and I'm not sure if the strong smell came from the chemicals or dye they used to color it tan like leather, but the smell reminded me of some kind of varnish or stain. The odor was so strong I had to set the boots outside for the whole day to air out, and the smell eventually went away. BUT, I would still purchase this boot again.	2015-08-16

Surprisingly they still look good as well. They last and I'm very hard on my shoes. It's the tomboy in me. They are extremely comfortable and look really good with jeans of any color. If you get a little something on them just take a damp cloth and wipe it gently off. They are very resistant to stains. On top of that they are extremely warm and cozy. Perfect for cold days. I even wire them to the snow and the dampness did not enter into the boot and kept my feet dry and warm. I've had so many compliments as well. Deborah where did you get those boots there so beautiful. Of course on Amazon.com. I love the black and grey it flows beautifully together. They are classy and casual. They are rather cheap also and last forever. I still have mine and I love them. They still look as if I just bought them. I'm very happy with the quality and look. If you love boots as I do you have to purchase these. Just a reminder they are very comfortable as I said earlier. My feet are sensitive and I appreciate comfort and an in style look.

They came in my size, fit perfectly both in length and width, and were comfortable for all day wear.  So you may be asking, why the 1-star rating?  After 3-4 months of wear, not even daily, the top of the sole began coming loose.  I figured it happens, but thought that a company like Sperry would stand behind their shoes and offer a repair or exchange since I always believed they cared about their customers and high-quality shoes.  I quickly realized they offer no such thing, and will only replace / exchange unworn shoes within 45 days.  I am not typically hard on my shoes - I have several pair of other brands, who shall go nameless in this review, which I've worn for close to a decade and while they appear worn still fit and are not falling apart.  I LOVED these shoes while I owned them, but I can't bring myself to buy another pair at these prices for risk they will fall apart again.	2015-08-16

I took off one star b/c the back has a tab that comes up a bit higher and that rubs and rubs all day. There's a bandaid there now. And also the soft cushy material inside makes my feet sweat so I hope it doesn't get stinky quickly. Other than those two things they're a good shoe.	2015-08-16

The straps, buckle, etc. are very soft and flexible (not leather but leather-like).  My issue is the foot bed.  It is difficult to walk in these shoes without a platform or softer foot bed.  I wear 4+ inch heels on a regular basis so the height of the heel wasn't unfamiliar to me.  The heel causes your weight to be pushed onto the ball of your feet as heels do, but there's no cushioning in that area which makes it difficult to walk for more than an hour or so.  Shoe inserts help.<br /><br />Regarding sizing, I wear 9.5 - 10.  I ordered this shoe in 10.  My feet fit w/a little overlap which isn't normal when I wear size 10.	2015-08-16

Adidas continues to get their outdoor shoes right.  These are amazing.  Very comfortable for all day, and very warm for cold.

The other day a young woman stood behind me - unusually close - in a checkout line while I was paying. Normally, the next person in line would remain &#34;about even&#34; with the cashier as I used the credit/debit card terminal where groceries are bagged.  However, as I was swiping my card, the young woman was less than a foot away and I was not certain if she were attempting to capture my card or was just plain oblivious to any sense of &#34;personal space.&#34;  She definitely was well within my comfort zone and, as a &#34;senior citizen&#34; it was clear there was no reason for her to be so close. I was concerned with the safety of my card.  It got me thinking, so I did a search for the best products to prevent RFID capture.<br /><br />I bought the Access Denied wallet for my wife and she loves it.  The color of the wallet is a bit inaccurate on the web page and is even richer &#34;in person.&#34;  The quality is outstanding and she is very happy with every aspect of her wallet.  In addition to the wallet providing excellent shielding, she has individual RFID blocking sleeves for each card.  We highly recommend the Access Denied wallet!<br /><br />One caution...while RFID chipped cards are secured in the wallet and sleeves, we have good confidence they are safe from capture by someone with bad intentions.  However, when the card is actually out, uncovered and being used is a vulnerable time.  The next time I am in line and someone like the young lady above gets too close, you can bet she/he will be asked to stand back before we uncover our card.	2015-08-16

Didn't buy on Amazon, but wanted to write a review.  My daughter loved them in the beginning.  She and her friends were making wishes on the them (with the music).  However, once she got to school the twinkle music was a bit distracting.  Teacher said that it wasn't too bad, so we went with it (some teachers I know would not like that).  Now she has only been wearing them a total of 2 weeks, the music (twinkle sound) goes off all by it-self!  When I bought them, the lady at the store said that there is an on and off switch, yes there is but only for the lights NOT the music.  The shoes are pretty and my daughter loves them but they have got to go back!	2015-08-16

No need to break them in.  The synthetic material stretches some, and I feel my left shoe is a bit loose.

I can wear them casually in jeans or dress them up with a dress.  I'm not in love with the Volcom signature on the top of the shoe, but other than that these are a great purchase.

Asics has always been my go to running brand and I thought, even though these shoes were on the cheaper side, that Asics, as a brand, would not fail me. I was very wrong. I run about 30-40 miles a week and I needed a new pair after about 2 months, which is about the minimum distance a running shoe should last. I suppose, for a rather cheap shoe I should expect minimum performance but I expected more from Asics. Additionally, the wear was ridiculous on the shoe, on the left side of my left food the heal part was almost entirely worn down about a month and 2 weeks into use.<br /><br />The worst part of the shoe though were the constant blisters on my pinky toes. The shoes were not tight, but the stitching, which connects the outer lining to the breathable fabric basically dug cut into my toes as I ran pealing the skin back.	2015-08-16

I ordered these to replace a pair of nimbus 15- this shoe has a trail running style sole and is less expensive.<br /><br />The cushioning is on par with the nimbus.  I have problems with my calcaneus and achilles tendon and the nimbus works better protecting that.  I think mainly because its not as ruggedly built in the back of the shoe and doesn't put as much pressure on the bone.<br /><br />But i think my issue is more running shoe vs trail shoe.  I would recommend these as a good trail running shoe, particularly if having more sole cushion is your main goal..	2015-08-16

My 2yr old wore them for our vow renewal and decreed them &#34;princess shoes&#34;, and I have to agree.  They are very dainty looking, with a slim profile on the foot (they don't add any bulk whatsoever).  The fit does seem a bit smaller than other See Kai Run shoes, but so much that I thought she needed the next size up (she's a solid 8 in other SKR styles).  I do expect that these may be the first size 8 shoes that will have to be retired, but that's ok given the beauty of the style.	2015-08-16

The minimalist Five Fingers greatly improved my running form. I was free of knee and foot pain caused by traditional running shoes. I loved the Five Fingers, but was always having to lookout for loose rocks on the road or other things that are unpleasant to step on with a minimalist shoe. I decided to try the Altra Paradigm to see if I could find maximum cushioning and protection, but still have a shoe that allowed my toes to spread naturally. The Altra's did the trick. They still discourage heel striking while giving freedom for my toes to spread out into a comfortable position. The springy cushioning reminded me of those summer days as a kid bouncing on a trampoline, but after a week of running, my feet and knees are thankful for the soft landings and my eyes are free from constantly scanning the ground ahead of me for minor debris. Shoes that are shaped like feet are long overdue. Finally, I did not mark that the shoes provide good arch support. This requires explanation. The shoes provide less arch support than some traditional running shoes. I believe this is by design to give you the feel of running barefoot. I don't consider this a drawback, but a substantial benefit. I only wish I could get my dress shoes in the same shape!	2015-08-16

It's a little narrow, but I loosened the laces in the wide area and they work just fine. I've been wearing them for two weeks and they seemed to have stretched a little bit...good for me. I have a high arch, so for normal feet, these shoes should be okay. I tend to get arch supports for many of my shoes anyway. By the end of the day, my feet throb a little, but it's tolerable. Easy to clean with just a damp towel, but I need to find out how take out more stubborn stains.	2015-08-16

Love these shoes. I followed the advice of going up a half size and that was probably good advice. I bought these shoes because I was able to get a very wide size (2E).

These sunglasses are made well. They have polarized lenses which add so much clarity to things, especially around water. They have springy arms which means that they won't stretch or break on larger faces and will spring back to fit smaller ones. I have the smoke color and the protections is good. They aren't too dark but they block the sun well while allowing me to clearly see everything. I originally got these for my husband and they really are a tad wide on me but I liked the clarity so I kept them. He loses. Ha!<br /><br />The style is no nonsense. It isn't a celebrity style or anything but they look good with any outfit. They're simple but they don't distort or cause me to feel like I am walking crooked. I have some sunglasses that actually feel like they are prescription glasses - and not MY prescription. I don't know why that is but they make me feel a bit wobbly and there is a bit of distortion that bugs me. These glasses are crystal clear as far as distortion which is the main reason I kept them. That and the polarized lenses which many fashion sunglasses do not have.<br /><br />They are, though, a bit wide as I mentioned. I think they are better for larger faces. But they don't slip down or cause any issues and they look fine on me. They're a big change from my usual oversize glasses or my mirrored wayfarers. I like them and feel they are high quality. They are pricier than many cheap fashion glasses but they're worth it because they are well made and have such good clarity. I am going with 4 stars. I wish they were a bit  narrower but that's just because of my small face, not the glasses. These are a great choice for people who want sunglasses for hiking, fishing, and almost any activity.  Really cheap sunglasses are fine for lounging by the pool but when you need clarity, you need to look beyond style to functionality.<br /><br />I received these glasses at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review. I am not affiliated with the company or seller and was not obligated to leave a positive review.positive review.	2015-08-16

When that happens, the shoes become hard on my feet, ankles, and achilles tendons.  Make a long story short... I've been wearing one pair of these exclusively for over seven months.  The sandals are as comfortable as when I first got them.  And the heels are not worn down.  Have no idea how or why, but I am through trying other brands.  These are perfect.  My only complaint?  I want a pair in black.  Update:  still love them.  But I leather straps feel like they are not as thick as my first pair.  So i got out my digital micrometer.  Yup.  The leather is not as thick.

The first bag I received had a hole in one of the seams - not something I had noticed as a common issue from any of the other reviews. I sent it back immediately and ordered a replacement, which was handled seamlessly (no pun intended).  By the end of the week, I had a new bag, flawless, which I LOVE.  (Today I joked that I wished I had spent more time out of the house, so I could have a reason to be wearing my new purse.)  The item has a great, casual look, with an attractive print, and I love that it has the two zippers (for the main compartment and a small inside compartment), as well as being spacious.  While I wouldn't fill it up routinely with heavy items as the material isn't super thick (maybe a little thicker than a relatively well made t-shirt?), the bag appears to be well made, and it would be just right for carrying a bottle of water or book in addition to a wallet and other &#34;typical&#34; purse items.  The bag appears to be well made, and I anticipate it will serve me well for quite some time! Based on other reviews I had been concerned about the bag hanging too low on me at 5'2&#34;, but it sits with the opening near my waist and the bag itself at thigh-height, which I think adds to the casual look and I find ideal--it gives comfortable access to the bag while it's hung across my body, and the low positioning prevents any discomfort from the items in the bag being under one's arm while walking as with the positioning of a traditional purse. As someone who was dreading the hunt for a new purse after the strap on my old one finally broke (I'm not into purses, but can respect the practicality of having a way to carry items of necessity!), I've found one that I love so much, I'm almost happy my old one kicked the bucket. :)	2015-08-16

I finally decided to pay the extra dough for water shoes, and i couldn't have been happier with my decision.

I have issues with my feet, and in the past I would purchase Speedo brand water shoes, or even worse, Walmart brand, and I always paid the price for it.

The cushion inside the shoe is also well made and comfortable.	2015-08-16

I have had them only a week but they seem pretty durable. The only downfall? After a full day in these my feet were a little sweaty since they certainly don't breathe. Any rainboot would have this issue though. So, wear some breathable socks (go with wool as opposed to cotton) and you'll be good to go!	2015-08-16

I am 6'2&#34; and 400lb and let me tell you, those slippers are out of bounds amazing... They provide tons of support, tons of comfort and you'll feel you're walking on a cloud even if a really heavy guy like me. I used to never wear slippers because they were always bugging me, I prefered to walk barefoot, but when standing for a long time on the ceramic kitchen floor, my feet were hurting very bad, and sometimes for days... So I decided to try to find the best slippers for big guys. I found those were comming over and over again. Quality of craftmanship is perfect, in fact they will scream quality as soon as you'll open the box, they will last for years to come. Oh, and the lining is über soft.<br /><br />Although I usually wear 4E wide shoes, I found the Medium  (only width they had when I ordered) were perfect, those are made large, not narrow at all and you can adjust from both sides if you have a thick foot.<br /><br />So, ladies, if you want to make your big man happy, buy him these...	2015-08-16

They are easy to get on and off, attractive and comfortable to wear with one caveat. It is a characteristic of my feet rather than the shoes that causes the problem. My right foot is a perfect 6 and a half but my left foot needs a size seven due to toe deformity caused by an arthritic condition. This is a general shout out to shoe sellers and manufacturers. Please let me buy a pair of shoes with a right size 6 1/2 C and a left size 7 C ! I bought the size 6 1/2 because it was &#62; $20.00 less expensive than the size 7. I can wear the right shoe all day long but the left foot only lasts an hour or two.  I keep hoping that the flexible fabric will gradually accommodate my twisty toes.  At least my right foot isn't slipping out of the shoe as it does when I put it in a size 7.	2015-08-16

I originally got these shoes in a different color from the outlets and as soon as I wore them I knew I had to have a second pair. I was looking for a comfortable, cute pair of sandals that didn't kill my feet from being too flat. This shoe has a lot of cushion and can be worn for longer periods of time and I'm so happy I can finally wear flat sandals without sacrificing comfort, and I also love that I can wear these with such a wide variety of outfits.  Well worth the money, love the aerosoles brand!	2015-08-16

They are surprisingly comfortable- especially for the height of the wedge. I usually can not wear heels or high wedges due to an old foot injury, but the combination of the height in the toe and the placement/ snugness of the straps allowed me to comfortably wear these all day at my sister's wedding- I was even comfortable dancing in them! That being said, my foot is a bit on the wide side and the straps are a bit tight, but because they are leather, they will give and stretch as all my Born/ b.o.c. shoes do. Overall, I thought these sandals were an extremely good buy and I would highly recommend them.	2015-08-16

I don't usually write reviews, but I had to share my opinion of these Fresh Foam 980's.  I am an Officer in the US Army and these shoes helped me considerably through Officer Candidate School (OCS).  I wore them 6 days of week for workouts including runs, obstacle courses, cross-fit workouts, combatives training, and weight training.  They survived regular abuse for this intensive 12 week course, plus 2 months of running 4 days a week, plus the wounded warrior half marathon.  They finally bit the dust yesterday on a 9 mile hike of skyline drive in the Shenandoah valley.  These shoes are comfortable for me despite my low arches and unlike other zero drop shoes they have considerable support with a lightweight design.  I would recommend these shoes to anyone, I just bought my second pair and I will probably wear these shoes for running for the rest of my career.  Thanks NewBalance!<br />2LT	2015-08-16

When you first wear them they will feel extremely tight and you will be tempted to exchange them for a bigger size... Don't do it!!! After about 1-2 weeks of wearing them, they will stretch out comfortably and mold to your feet. They are really nice and warm in the cold weather, but I can even wear these when it's not so cold, because the shearling keeps your feet from overheating no matter what temperature. I hope Ugg doesn't discontinue this style because I seriously want to have these for the rest of my life (I started wearing these in my early 20s :D).	2015-08-16

I have bought these shoes before at a Timberlake store and found that though I usually wore a 9 to 9 1/2, this shoe was more comfortable for me in a 10. I have had them a number of years. First I wore them as casual shoes and them as work shoes when I knew I would be standing on my feet a long period of time. The soul  has, after say 5 years plus, started to split away from the upper part of the shoe. But I have to say I do work them hard and wear them most everyday. I have had the shoemaker re-glue them about 2 times now, which works for quite a while,but  have decided to go for a new pair. I like the look, very nice look for casual wear, and they really do feel comfortable after hours on my feet. I will buy them as long as they are still a stock item.	2015-08-16

They are cute but not worth the money. They fall off bc you can't tie them tight enough and when you try to tie them tight the shoe string breaks off. I have had these a week and the shoe lace on one has broke off so now there's hardly any hope on my daughter getting to wear them. And the reason I bought them was to wear for pictures we are getting in a couple weeks... No hope there. But of course that's my fault, should have just kept them tucked away till then.	2015-08-16

I'm a fan of Clarks shoes, but sometimes the sizing can be a bit too big or small.  Based on other reviews, I ordered my regular size and these fit just right.  The look is great and they're very comfortable for wearing all day.  If I were to complain about anything it would be that they can be a bit slippery on wet tile floors.  Luckily, that isn't a problem very often, but something you might want to be aware of.	2015-08-16

They are a bit stiff at first but begin to break in after the first couple of times  wearing them. I bought these because I have another pair that are one of my favorites and are  the ones I go to when I know that I will have a busy day of being on my feet and walking  a lot. The leather and workmanship are exceptional, and I expect these  shoes will last many years if given proper care maintenance. I have replaced the heels once on the older pair, but the soles are pretty tough and still have a ways to go before they will need to be replaced.	2015-08-16

I had to put an arch support in the shoes to make them fit tight enough so I did not walk out of them. I cannot wear regular dress socks or I really slip out. A heavier sock is what I have to use.  I still lift out of the heel but hoping as they wear in that will stop. I have  narrow foot but medium seems to be the only width on the market unless I go to an expensive shoe.	2015-08-16

In retrospect, I probably should have tried the shimano triathlon shoes, as they are more forgiving.  Ended up getting a Lake triathlon shoe, in 48 wide.	2015-08-16

The only reason I didn't give the shoes a 5 star rating is that I think they aren't as cool looking as some other hiking shoes, and they look a little wide and boxy, and also they are not goretex or truly waterproof, but for the money ($130) they have been a great investment so far.	2015-08-16

This may be 4th or 5th pair I have bought of the same type. I weight above normal, and heavy built(not obese). I play badminton and tennis actively and do wear these shoes on indoor court as well as outdoor. The gum rubber sole is soft enough to grip the wooded floor of a badminton court just right. And on tennis hard courts, it's durable enough to withstand the abrasion caused by the sudden stop-starts and turns.<br /><br />I have also used it for normal walking/running, but for distance running, I'd recommend using other shoes designed for the purpose.<br />I'd also caution against using it on grass or clay surfaces.	2015-08-16

Plantar's Fasciitis got better but the toes (bunions and other problems) got worse.  The naturally-shaped toe box, toe spacers, and Zero-drop shoes are working much better for me, and I am transitioning into them as directed, for the most part.<br /><br />They may save me from bunion surgery, which is far more gruesome than I ever thought it would be (cut the bone and bolt it back into place?).  I thought that dropping the orthopedic &#34;molded&#34; inserts ($680 ones, I might add) that the Plantar's Fasciitis might come back, but so far it's better than it was when I had the orthopedic &#34;arch-support&#34; inserts.<br /><br />I strongly recommend the reading (and products) at &#34;Naturalfootgear.com&#34;.  It takes time, but even if I still need surgery, I can avoid having the problems come back again.<br /><br />This is the perfect shoe for the first stage of transitioning into wide-toe (naturalistic foot ware), zero-drop shoes.  I'm delighted with the results so far, about two weeks in.	2015-08-16

FInally found my hiking boots.  These boots wear softly, they broke in quickly.  I've had them a year, and they are holding up nicely.  The only complaint is that my right boot creased oddly on the top (think due to where the ties start) so they made the top of my foot sore.

As other reviewers said, the tongues do slouch down. You really can't make them stand up, but I kind of like that look.

Some of my favorite places to fish and hunt, are in SNAKE  infested areas. I saw these New  Woods and Stream 1400 Snake Bite Boots, by Weinbrenner Shoe Company ,one of Americas oldest and finest quality  shoe companies  and they were just what I was looking for. They are 19&#34; tall from sole to boot top. The coolest thing is they come in a Mossy Oak Brand Camo pattern. They are X-Streamly waterproof. They are also made of the finest leather and heavy duty thick, cordura style,  snake proof materials. The zipper is thick and beefy ,for a long life in the field. The soles and toe guards, provide multi surface traction, lateral stability and are self cleaning. These boots are also very lightweight. They have handles on the top of the boots ,for easy slip in comfort. I have tested these boots in many different, in the field conditions ,muddy,slippery very wet, immersed in water,rocky terrain, except an actual Snake Bite and find them to be of the very highest quality materials and workmanship. I give these snake bite boots my very highest recommendation for,overall comfortability and peace of mind, when I am rooting around in the desert , in snake territory. { FISHGRILLER APPROVED }	2015-08-16

The leather is of good quality, and it's difficult to see in the photo, but the finish is pearly (in pink anyway), so my daughter was extra excited. At the sale price, these are a good buy, but I still would never pay full price for L & L shoes for a kid.  UPDATED 9/30/15: Reducing stars from 4 to 1. After one month of wear to school, my daughter came home in tears because her shoe broke. The velcro attachment on the shoe separated from the upper, so the strap cannot be secured. I expected her to wear these shoes all school year so I am very disappointed, but not as disappointed as my 4 year old. And of course, because I purchased these just over 30 days ago (to prepare for the school year), I can't return them. I'm going to contact L & L directly and see if I can get a replacement sent. I will update my review if my issue is resolved.  UPDATED 1/15/16: I forgot to update this earlier, but L & L sent us a replacement pair after I sent them a copy of my invoice. Happy kiddo, happy mama. I  put my rating up to a 4 this time, as these are holding up well after 4 months, but I'm docking an overall star because they should never have broken that way in the first place.	2015-08-16

What I really liked about these sunglasses(along with the price, $4.95 ea.) is the U.V Glass lenses and the Metal frame! Glass lenses will last much longer than plastic; it doesn't scratch when they're cleaned. The metal frame is much more durable and stylish. I liked the unique  design as well; still a wrap-around , but a different type. The one issue I had was when I flipped them down from the top of my head the plastic nose bridge would get entangled with my hair. I would have ordered a third pair, but a recent Amazon search produced a completely different type. I don't think this particular design is being offered any longer. Glad I ordered two!	2015-08-16

I have other pairs of Cleo Croc sandals, all of which fit wonderfully, the most comfortable sandals I have ever owned. I can literally walk all day in them! But this new pair of the same size and same style does not fit the same. The bed of the sandal seems to be the correct size, but the straps are tighter and prevent my foot from going far enough to the front to fit correctly. The material seems of lesser quality as well. Are these now made by a different manufacturer? I am considering trying the next size up, but hesitate because the bed of these IS the right size.	2015-08-16

The frames have a unique, yet subtle design on them.<br /><br />The frames are a wrap around style which provides full sun protection a with a comfortable rubberized nose piece.  The arms of the shades are straight so they sit comfortably right on top of your ears without pinching or tugging on your ears; they hug your head comfortably without squeezing too tightly.  Also, on the inside of the arms, there is a strip of texturized rubber to prevent them from slipping when you move your head or look down.<br /><br />The lenses of these shades are a nice brown helping to block out the UV rays.  These shades are great for driving since they have high definition lenses.  I received these Sunglasses for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-16

I had sent a pair of Asics Gel Foundation 8's back to AsicsAmerica because the soles were peeling after just 7 months of wear and because they were still under the 2 year defective product warranty, they sent me a free pair of these Gel Fortify.<br />They are SOOOOOO COMFORTABLE!<br />I am 6'3&#34;, 240lbs with flat feet and I have to wear my Asics all day at the physical therapy clinic where I work. I have had these for a few weeks, but I can already tell I will have no problems wearing these for 8 hrs a day at the clinic. I have been wearing Asics for 10 years now and this is like my 7th pair, but they are probably the MOST comfortable pair I've owned! It's important to note that when I buy my Asics, I don't buy their cheap models either because I wear a 15 (4E) which is like double wide plus I need the Dynamic Duomax for my severe over-pronation. As a matter of fact, I may buy another pair as a backup for when these wear out!<br />I DEFINITELY recommend this model. They seem true to width as well as size and I can't over emphasize the amount of cushion and support. As soon as I tried them on out of the box it was like walking on clouds. I would give them 6 stars out of 5!	2015-08-16

US	41718038	R3JPR4QF5VWCJ7	B002FU6UCK	306565124	Maui Jim Makaha Polarized Sunglasses	Shoes	2	0	0	N	N	Comfortable lightweight frames, terrible quality lens and Maui Jim support	We (I bought them for my spouse) have owned 2 pair of these MJ Makaha 405-10, the first pair lasted about 24 months before the lens cracked at the screws at the nose bridge. The second pair cracked in the same place within 18 months, despite handling them with extreme care (she only uses them for beach walks and driving, no sports). She says these are the most comfortable glasses she's ever owned, so for that they get 2 stars (her previous pair of Maui Jim's were Cyclone 136 which were heavy and uncomfortable). But when you pay this much for sunglasses they should last longer or be repaired without a runaround. When she bought the first pair at our local MJ retailer here in Hilton Head, I assumed the lenses were replaceable when I saw the screw mounts, which I found out was incorrect. After they broke, the seller offered the send them back to MJ for repair but the cost was prohibitive, and in my opinion should have been free anyway. But since they were so comfortable, I went ahead and got her another pair. But now that the second pair have the same 'defect', I will not waste another penny on Maui Jim's. Which is too bad because I know they are a quality brand, but I refuse to support a company that won't stand behind their product- especially after I gave them a second chance. And if you peruse the reviews here and elsewhere, you'll see this is not an isolated incident or due to counterfeit products. I'll probably try the sunglassfix replacement lens since we now have 2 perfectly good frames, and hopefully they'll last longer than the original lens. If not, here we come Tifosi.	2015-08-16

I have Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome, Plantar Fasciitis, the beginning stages of hammer toes on both feet  and degenerative joint in my right foot.  The Go Walk 2 are the ONLY shoes I can wear comfortably...not that they take any of my discomfort away but they minimize my pain by allowing me to not antagonize the issues by virtue of having a very SOFT top (over my toes) thereby no rubbing, and they are a SHOE...which keeps me from having to grip with my toes to keep them on...like I do when wearing sandals...which I was doing year-round (Naots with the removable footbed).  One complaint...they've quit making the Go Walk 2 and NONE OTHER OF THE NEWER MODELS FIT THE SAME!  why couldn't they just have let well enough alone?!  The sizing is all wrong and while I wore a size 7 in these, now a 7 is too small and a 7 1/2 doesn't fit comfortably.  I've been buying up the Go Walk 2 wherever I can still FIND them!  They're not cheap and they DO wear out...especially since my feet never touch the ground without wearing a pair.  The shoe itself holds up great...can even launder, but the footbed tends to get quite flat after a few months of wear.  I only weigh 107 lbs. so it's not my weight that's so hard on the footbed.  Overall, they are a lifesaver to me!	2015-08-16

And, as a bit of a forewarning, I'm in the process of sending these back as I type this review because these shoes just did not work for me at all.<br /><br />I found these in a local shoe store and really liked them when I tried them on, particularly the lightweight feel, but they didn't have a size that fit well, so we bought them on Amazon a half-size up later that day. They arrived August 12 and I've worn them repeatedly in the three days since. However, after wearing them and being on my feet for a few hours at a time, I've come to the conclusion that these shoes would only work for a relatively small niche of people; that is, people with narrow feet who live in cooler climates.<br /><br />Below the mesh upper is another, relatively thick layer of fabric that negates any breathability the mesh upper might confer to the foot; add to this the synthetic covering of the memory foam insole and you have a recipe for a shoe that retains heat very well. While this may be a blessing in colder weather, in Texas heat, it's a veritable nightmare for your feet as, after less than an hour, your feet will be hot and sweaty and you'll be wanting to remove the shoes with all haste.<br /><br />Normally, I love Skechers' memory foam insole, as my Avillos have it and I wore those until the insole started coming apart at the seams and flaking off (I got a good several years' use out of them, so I'd say I got my money's worth; they're still functional even now), but with the way the insole is designed on these Persistents, if you have anything but a very narrow foot or tend to walk on the outer edge of your foot, the memory foam insole might as well be nonexistent. I took a measurement and, at the arch of the foot on a size 11, the insole measures a measly 2 inches in width; for comparison, my own foot at the same spot is 3.5 inches wide. Granted, I have a wide foot, so that's not the best comparison, but I've generally found with Skechers that I can reliably go up a half-size if a wide is not available (and it wasn't in these in the color we bought) and be perfectly comfortable. Not so this time. I found the inside half of my foot was resting off the edge of the insole, which was not the most comfortable experience.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these shoes DO have some good points. I said this shoe was a good concept with a less than stellar execution and I meant it. The idea of a lightweight, flexible, and casual slip-on shoe that you could wear with most anything is a very attractive one and in those respects, it actually succeeds. Skechers states on their website that a Men's 9 weighs about 6 or 7.5oz (I can't remember exactly) and I wouldn't be surprised if the 11 weighed more than 8-9oz; they are very flexible and the upper has a good amount of give that I've only found surpassed by Converse All-Stars High Tops. And they are also casual, looking good with shorts or jeans or cargo pants, though whether or not they would actually go with anything is dependent on color (the black or charcoal, I think, would work with just about any outfit, the latter especially).<br /><br />However, because of the shortcomings of the stifling upper and the too narrow insole, the places you actually want a shoe to succeed (particularly a walking shoe), these fall far short of what I was hoping for them to be.so that's not the best comparison, but I've generally found with Skechers that I can reliably go up a half-size if a wide is not available (and it wasn't in these in the color we bought) and be perfectly comfortable.

Got these for an upcoming vacation and I think they are going to be perfect. I love teva products so there shouldn't be any breaking in time.  They are light (which is good for water) but have structure to them when walking on rocks.

So I might wear them on the plane too to save packing extra shoes :-)	2015-08-16

I love these golf shoes!<br /><br />I purchased these shoes 3 years ago and decided to share my experience with these golf shoes.<br /><br />I played High School golf so I had practice every day, 5 days a week, and often went golfing on the weekends with my family so I needed a reliable shoe that was comfortable and that could take a beating. These Puma golf shoes were the perfect find! The shoe fits as expected and they are extremely comfortable... often after a round of golf I would forget to take them off because they were so comfortable.<br /><br />It's been 3 years and I still have these shoes and they are still in mint condition, no cracks, rips, or tears in any of the material and they look brand new. Even after playing golf in heavy rain and even snow! these shoes have  stood the test of time and I strongly recommend them to anyone in need of a high quality golf shoe.<br /><br />I will gladly buy another pair once I out grow or decide to replace my old pair.<br /><br />Overall this is a great product and I'm very happy with my purchase!	2015-08-16

I'd usually wear sandals (Chaco or Teva style) for something like this, but I wanted a closed toe for walking up the trails for the tubing.<br /><br />My experience with Teva's shoes is they run true on width, but I usually go a 1/2 size up for the length.<br /><br />I wore them around for a few days to make sure they would work for the amount of walking I'd be doing in them.  The look is great and they are very comfortable, light and breathable for all day casual wear around town.  They worked well with socks and without.<br /><br />From a technical point of view, they drained & dried pretty well for a water/rafting shoe.  Way more comfortable than water shoes that are just a mesh sock with a rubberized bottom.  Better on the toes when you lock your feet into the raft on the rapids and kept the feet a little warmer than sandals.<br /><br />Overall very impressed.  These won't replace my sandals or hiking shoes/boots, but they are a great in-between shoe and light enough to justify their inclusion in my pack.	2015-08-16

He says they are comfortable for the first few hours of work but his feet start hurting at about the 5 hour mark, which really isn't bad. We have attributed this to the boots needing to be &#34;broken in&#34;. Overall he is highly satisfied with the boots and is already talking about ordering a second pair.	2015-08-16

I bought the taupe patent, which looks like a normal nude tone. I would say it runs about on size (maybe a little big), but the toe box put terrible pressure on my big toe from the top, so by the end of my workday I was in so much pain that I couldn't even walk. I have never had shoes do this before, so I'm going to say it was the shoe, not my feet.	2015-08-16

As I've aged (I'm 45) I've noticed my eyes are much more sensitive to bright sunlight. I've had to upgrade my sunglasses from the cheapos at the local mart to polarized eyewear. Unfortunately there is usually a huge difference in price between the two. I honestly though that a pair of $40 polarized glasses would not truly be polarized. After reading a few other reviews I decided to give these a try. I was beyond thrilled when these arrived and not only did they look decent on me, but they were polarized! They come with a little silky cloth sleeve to keep them protected when I have to toss them in my purse. I'm very happy with these and will be back for a spare time soon! I received product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.	2015-08-16

I was excited to see they still had the same style, because they were very comfortable, and I got many compliments on them. These are not the same as the earlier pair. They don't fit as well. The straps seem to be a little bit shorter, making them a tight fit, the heel isn't as comfortable and they don't seem to have as much support in the foot bed. They feel like flipflops. My feet are tired at the end of the day wearing these. My old ones were so comfortable that I could be on my feet and wear them for an extended time without discomfort. I noticed the old ones were manufactured in China, the new ones in Viet Nam. Perhaps there have been tiny design changes that add up to a not-quite-as-good sandal. Time to shop for a brand of sandals that offers better quality and more comfort.	2015-08-16

Sleek and just a bit classier than the basic flip-flop: a nice change from too-trashy, too-blingy, or too-hippie. Seemingly indestructible; I've had them for two years, now. The usual grippy, sturdy Crocs sole material and comfy footbed. The strap is one piece - the metallic bit is molded in, and just painted to contrast. I'm usually in need of somewhat supportive shoes, but I can wear these for longer than any other sandal I've tried.	2015-08-16

I was not impressed at first, because the frames seemed to be cheap plastic popped out of a mold. The tips of the temples still had little plastic hangers-on that were sharp. So needed to sand them with a fingernail file before wear. They're lightweight, the blue lens/silver frame combination look good, and haven't heard complaints regarding comfort. No characters or brand logos - I liked that. Can he break or scratch them?  Sure. Update August 20, 2015:  They didn't even make it two weeks!  Frame cracked below the eye and lens popped out. I wasn't witness to the event, but it looks like an accidental &#34;stepped on 'em.&#34;  Might buy again after I look around a bit.	2015-08-16

The inner lining of this shoe gave me a nice snug fit and helped the shoes stay on my feet while running through some deep mud. The shoes are slightly heavier than your normal running shoe, but the extra material used gives you good traction when on the trails. They wash off easy. I would not recommend sitting them in the sun to dry. It seemed like the leather shrunk in the heat. It took about a week of wearing the shoes for them to feel normal again. I still use the shoes for trail running and obstacle racing	2015-08-16

Four part Ostrich Promo boots are ok.  The right boot has a bump near the toe, I guess Ostrich hide is not totally uniform.  Did not want to return since it is not that noticeable.  Size is 91/2 ee, I normally wear 9ee.  Wanted them a bit larger, if they stretch much then I can wear thicker socks.  Surprised that Tony Lama is now owned by Justin Boots, but that's ok.  Bottom line not a bad boot, but my other 10 year old Tony Lama boots are better construction, particularly in the arch.  Soles at the arch are completely flat as opposed to the rounded sole in the arch of prior Tony Lama boots.  For the $94 promo price, cant't complain too much.  I only wear my boots when I go out to dinner dances, not for work(retired).	2015-08-16

So since these were so inexpensive I was really hesitant to order but based on the other reviews I went ahead and tried them and I'm glad I did!  These are so cute!  I ordered the black size 6 and they fit true to size.  I haven't worn them for an extended period of time but I would say for me personally I would wear these out at night on the weekends but wouldn't walk around in them all day because of the heel height.  But they are comfy for heels.  They were not too tight and didn't pitch forward so they are not hard to walk in at all.  The faux suede is nice.  I think I'll order these in the burgundy too!	2015-08-16

I was given a pair of these by my wife, and they became my go-to shoes for wearing while doing yard work. Insanely comfortable, easy to hose off to clean, great ventilation on hot Southern days. They stayed outside for me to wear when the next impromptu chore came along. I had them for over a year, wore them constantly when yard duties called each weekend.<br /><br />Lately, I noticed as I placed the shoes on my feet each week that they were getting harder and harder to slide on my feet. I was finally forcing my feet into the toe box just to get them on. I worried that I was retaining water in my feet, possibly a sign of heart issues...turns out, all I needed was a new pair. The shoes, left outside day after day, will slowly shrink. My old and new shoes, side-by-side, show the old to be easily one size smaller than it first was, maybe two sizes. The new shoes, by contrast, are roomy and comfortable.<br /><br />[In the attached photo, the shoe on the left is the &#34;old&#34; shoe, the one on the right is the one just delivered, and BOTH are size 11]<br /><br />The moral to the story is to care for your Crocs, don't leave them outside for days on end. Otherwise, they may begin to get snug on you, too.	2015-08-16

Haven't had them very long so I don't know how they will wear.  I bought them just to wear around, not to workout.  They come with a cushiony insole, although, if I was going to work out in them I would replace the original insole with one of the Dr. Scholl type since the arch support seems to be lacking in these shoes.	2015-08-16

AA is never too narrow for me, and about 30% of the time, AA is a bit too wide (ex: I have 1 other pair of Trotters, size 9.5AA, whose straps are a little too wide).  I can wear medium shoes only if the footbed isn't too wide and they have fully adjustable straps, and even then sometimes the overall shape of the straps and shoe is too wide. i ordered the Grace in a 9.5AA and - surprise! - they are a bit too narrow in the forefoot to be comfortable. I can only remember once in my life (and i am old and have always bought a lot of shoes, ha) that i have run across a size narrow shoe that is too narrow for me. these might have stretched enough and i got such a good deal that i probably would have tried that, except that the arch support in this shoe is so non-existent that it makes a sucking sound at the arch of my foot when i walk. I had to laugh. You know how some shoes have discernable arch support - that is, the arch part of the shoe rises up?  Well, in this shoe it caves in at the arch.  (i have medium-high arches and have to add slight to medium arch supports if i want to avoid knee pain in all shoes except for Dansko, Cobb Hill and some Eccos and Romikas.)	2015-08-16

The boots came packaged in a box that was a colorful barn on the outside with a top that even folded into the iconic A shape and the inside was a coloring space with kittens, chickens etc just like a real barn! There were peek-a-boo windows and the boots were super well padded inside their barn-box. They arrived in absolutely perfect condition. Nice thick leather, tight stitching and well padded insoles.

My husband is always losing or breaking his and this pair is his favorite style of sunglasses.  They have a silver frame with green earpieces. The lenses have a colorful mirrored finish.<br /><br />The frame of these sunglasses are a half frame supporting the lenses from the top.  They feel like they are well built, I don't feel like they will fall apart in my hands or his.  The nose piece has two soft silicone pads that flex independently of each other allowing a comfortable fit on the bridge of the nose.<br /><br />I like that when he looks downward to do something, the glasses do not slip off of his face.  It is also nice that the arms rest gently on the ears so they do not pull or tug on your ears.  These sunglasses are very nice looking, they would be a great gift or an extra pair to keep in your spouse's car.  My husband really likes this pair and I think he will be wearing them for quite some time.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-16

The ones in the picture do not reflect my pair, as I have more of a purplish hue to mine. I love them though. Awesome aviators and they really stand out from what others are typically wearing. So to me it is a great find. They do well to protect my eyes from harmful sun rays, while at the same time allowing me to look semi-cool. The sunglasses are made with quality materials and seem like they could take a good beating without breaking. (I have a 5/6) year old so they seem to be child proof for the most part. I did receive these glasses in exchange for an honest review. Recommended and endorsed to anyone who loves stylish aviators that are not so easily found, they are unique.	2015-08-16

For some reason, these soles are not as comfortable as the black pair.  There's design on the bottom of the sole that I assume is for non-slip purposes, but in this color, I feel the designs as though there is something stuck to the shoe.  Aside from that and the fact that they are slightly loose even on my wide feet, they're comfortable enough and they look good.	2015-08-16

The pair of shoes I recieved had bad quality control.  The arch support in one of the shoes had a smaller stitching which created a larger pad in the arch then the other.  Because of that the arch padding sticks up too much making these shoes are unwearable.  Also, I have 2 pairs of these shoes that I bought from Nordstroms at $195 so when I saw these for around $80 on Amazon I thought 'score'! But I was wrong the logo is not the same logo as the ones from Nordstroms.  I also found the top strap to be too tight on both the shoes from Nordstroms and these so I actually just cut it off which created a really nice pair of ballet flats.  With that being said I tried these on briefly when I received them to ensure fit and promptly cut the strap off.  I wasn't until I went to wear them out one day that I discovered the arch issue, so now I can't return them.	2015-08-16

So happy I found these shoes- I needed ones with a steel toe but they're almost impossible to find in a women's 5. These are a great alternative to bulky ankle boots. Fit great out of the box, didn't need to be broken in. I did, however, end up buying gel insoles (heels only because they don't make insoles small enough for a size 5!) because these weren't comfortable for 16 hour days. I've worn these so often and for such long hours at a time that I have calluses on my toe knuckles from the steel. That may be a con for some but it hasn't really bothered me. I expect at least two year's wear from these, definitely worth the money.  UPDATE July 2017: Two years later, still love these shoes. I did have to replace the laces once because one got torn and broke, but they've held up alright. There is one hole on the outside of the shoe, but I've never had an issue with dirt/moisture getting in. Replacing because I'm starting a new job and treating myself. For the amount of hours I spend in these, I'm more than willing to replace these every 2 years.	2015-08-16

Also the sides of this shoe cut my ankle bones. NOTE ABOUT ASH SOLES: I see reviewers complain about dirty soles....Ash soles are made of Gum Rubber and the sides will get dirty quickly with wear. Make up a solution of Oxy-Clean, apply and wipe off to clean the soles.	2015-08-16

I have purchased many insoles, and these were recommended to me by an orthopedic doctor.  I previously wore custom orthotics, but they weren't doing much for me.  These are very well cushioned and were not too difficult to fit into my sneakers.  They do not feel as bulky as many other insoles and I did wear them in very hot weather, so can say they did not make my feet feel uncomfortably hot.  These would probably be good for someone with heel or arch pain.  I ended up buying a second pair so I can have two pairs of comfortable walking shoes.	2015-08-16

I have A LOT of these handbags, and I mean A LOT!  This is one of the nicer ones because (1) decent price and comes in gray, (2) the zippers match the bag instead of the giant pale gray zippers frequently used on every bag color to save money, (3) holds a lot without looking like luggage, the bottom of this bag measures 11.25&#34; X 4.25&#34; and it arrived much much sooner than promised.  No problem with the lining getting caught in the zippers either.<br />Now you should know that this is not a designer bag.  It seems to be sewn &#34;well enough&#34;, however, the front flap is slightly crooked as is the zipper on that flap. (People who would be bothered by this, probably aren't buying inexpensive bags from China.) Like all nylon bags, it wipes up easily with a damp cloth.  The pockets are large, even the one on the face of the flap and the one on the back.  Not overly crazy about the big zipper pulls, but that's not a deal breaker.  The handle strap is highly woven nylon, not that loosely woven cotton that looks &#34;ratty&#34; after a while.  All said, I am pleased with it enough to want it in other colors.	2015-08-16

I needed a pair of light weight glasses for cycling vs the glass lens Island Time pair so I bought the Banyans and loved the style and weight. I was expecting the same performance as my other pair of Maui Jim's but that was cut short big time in glare, esp looking through a windshield of a vehicle I found myself trying to look around the glare and even squinting at times. I bought these from Sunglass hut so they should have been authentic Maui Jims but they definitely fell short of expectations. The Maui Jim Island time glasses do have glass lenses vs the plastic in the Banyans if that may play a roll I don't know but these were returned and I'm now in search again for the perfect cycling glasses.	2015-08-16

I stomped around Arches, Capitol Reef, Zion and Bryce Canyon for over a week in these, and couldn't be happier.  The average amount of hiking I did per day was about 5 miles, mostly moderate in difficulty (though I did tackle some of the shorter challenging hikes, like The Delicate Arch and The Upper Emerald Pool,) and my feet felt fine (100+ degree heat, more than anything, was the limiting factor.)  The traction was better than expected, and the support these shoes provided exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Over all, these hikers are light weight, supportive and comfortable.  Best of all, you can find them for &#60;$70 new.  Highly recommended.	2015-08-16

I ordered these flats after several returns of other shoes. For starters, they are actually dark BLUE, not bordering on black. Hard to find a blue shoe. They fit well, are comfortable and have enough room in the toes and have cushioning in the insole. They look really nice, not too flimsy or casual, so they can be worn to work. I think Lifestride runs a bit big so if you are between sizes get the smaller size. I wear 8.5m to 9m, ordered 8.5m and still put a thin foam insert into the shoe of my smaller foot. Another reviewer said they were stiff on the heel…. I think that's because they came with a stick stretching the heel to a point. As soon as I bent the heel back into a rounded shape they didn't rub at all.	2015-08-16

The fit is good, the heel height is right, but now after two months I need to throw them away! The rear strap comes all the way down the side of the heel to the sole.  The soles have begun to wear and, as a result, the rear strap has begun to fray.  I took the sandals to the shoe repair, who advised that because of the design there is nothing that can be done to fix them!<br /><br />I have worn these sandals once or twice a week.  That means I have probably worn them no more than 15 times. I also work in an office and drive to work, so these sandals are worn mainly inside and on carpeting.  Given the cost, I expect sandals to last a couple summers, but these ones won't even last one season!	2015-08-16

I purchased these after looking for YEARS for a pair of nice leather boots with a decent sole that wasn't just a picture of wood wrapped around the heel.  I was excited to find these and at such a good price.  I tried them on and noticed several things.  See pictures.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- The calf width is perfect for me (5ft. 7 inches, 120 lbs).  It isn't as wide as most boots which is a good thing..minimal gapping.<br />- The color was nice.<br />- The height was perfect.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The Leather is super super stiff.  It is thicker than my other leather boots which is nice, but I am now wondering how long it will take to break these<br />babies in.<br />- The ankle section is nearly impossible to get your foot in.  Once you do, it is so stiff you can hardly move your ankle.  That said, once they are on, they make you look like you have cankles due to the thickness of the leather and the cut.  There is no seam in the front of the boot so the leather isn't fitted in the front potion of your ankle.<br />- I thought these were made in the US.  They aren't.  They are made in Mexico?  So why the super expensive price?  There is a nice big stamp right inside the boot with &#34;Made in Mexico&#34;.  Sigh.  Also, I think someone else either wore these or at least tried them on because the inside leather of the boot was worn.<br /><br />I still haven't decided if I want to keep them yet or not.  I want to love them, but I fear I won't and then will be irritated that I spent this much $$ on a pair of boots I don't actually love.	2015-08-16

I dislike the bulk of the sole as the tan color is very distracting against the white shoe and the construction is a bit stiff.  I thought that these would be a great option for formal dresses for our vow renewal, but they ended up looking like cute girly play shoes instead.  I opted for the See Kai Run Tori mary janes instead to achieve a more formal look.	2015-08-16

I'd definitely go a wider size if I was to buy them again. Also the standard insoles are very thin in the forefoot area so it feels like your walking on bare concrete. The finish on the outside of the boot wasn't quite as high quality as I expected from wolverine. Other than that the heel and ankle support is awesome.<br />Not the best but still a good boot overall.	2015-08-16

These shoes are soft and comfy. The yoga mat bottoms are some of my fav. The cloth sling part is really comfortable too and I have gotten a lot of compliments on them.

I found such a great deal on these coral ones that I bought them anyway. They are still a little narrow, but it doesn't bother me too much.

These boots are great! They look wonderful and will look even better when they're broken in. Unfortunately I did buy the standard width instead of extra wide to fit my hobbit feet. Definitely not a fault on the boots. It was my own error and unwillingness to exchange them. Justin's do seem to run a bit wider so they've been fairly forgiving in that sense.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with these boots. The quality is excellent and I'll likely own them long enough to forget about the price. They make wonderful casual to dress-casual boots.	2015-08-16

Bought this 3-pack, knowing they were cheap.  Was initially happy with these sunglasses.

Fast forward ~ 2 months, all three pairs have had the coating deteriorate to the point I can no longer use them - big parts of the lens are simply clear now.  The kicker is that 2 of the pairs saw *maybe* 3 days of use, total.  Would not buy again, even for the cheap price.	2015-08-16

I don't like flip flop sandals and desired something with a little more support for wearing to the pool and beach. These have been great for short term casual wear. After a while, I find my feet get sore, probably because there is no arch support and they can be somewhat stiff. The straps provide plenty of support and room, and I like the color and design. If I were getting something for full-day wear around town, though, I'd get something more supportive and cushioned.	2015-08-16

They were comfortable from the minute I took them out of the box and put them on.  No need to break them in.  They are super lightweight and feel like slipper almost.  I am not into minimalist shoes because I have knee issues, flat feet and always need good arch support.  I use my own orthotics with all athletic shoes and often times they are stiff and uncomfortable at first.  Not with these shoes!  Immediately after I put them on, I was able to do a HIIT workout and then went out to run errands wearing them all day.  Seriously so comfortable!  I will be getting more in different colors!	2015-08-16

These are wonderful!<br /><br />I read the reviews and people said they run large, I am a true 9.5 and I bought a 9 and they're great. They fit me a tad bigger because my feet are quite narrow. Otherwise they have no arch support so if you're flat footed might be hard to wear them for long.<br />The fabric does stretch out but hopefully they'll still fit OK. Anyways, just an FYI, they're not great for driving! Safety first, right?<br /><br />Great purchase for hot summers. Recommend them!	2015-08-16

I would recommend going to Asics website to understand if the shoe is for your foot type prior to purchasing (Over pronate, underpronate etc.). I ignored this detail for years and spent a lot of money on shoes that hurt my ankles and feet. I would recommend going to a running store to have them analyze your foot to see how your stride is classified.  Sounds like a crazy thing to do, but it has made a huge difference for me and I am NOT an avid runner.	2015-08-16

Pros: colors go with any outfit; multiple strap options to suit your needs; shiny gold accents really make it &#34;pop&#34;; super soft material.  Cons: very powerful smell that has not gone away yet (I've had it for a week) - my husband says it smells like rubber; mine came with a tear/hole about 2&#34; long where the lining material meets the seam near the zipper; would have liked just one more pocket somewhere. Neutral: it's pretty heavy and bigger than I thought it was going to be, but I'm also a small handbag kind of girl.  This was my first time to order a purse online...I think I'll stick to in-store purchases when it comes to hand bags.	2015-08-16

My only complaint is that the shoe stretches and the comfortable snugness is somewhat less. I receive compliments on this shoe all the time. Eileen Fisher must have received the same response because the company brought the shoe back for the 2015 line, I do not find it on sale a this point.

They are pricey if you don't get them on sale. I got a good deal because it was a hideous color that apparently didn't sell well. After I got them, I realized they weren't as ugly as I thought. Anyhoo, they are a bit narrower than my previous trail shoe and I was worried about not feeling as stable, but they are actually very stable. Of course, the  super aggressive sole is great on just about everything except wet wood and slippery rocks, but really, what shoe is good on those surfaces? I like technical trails with lots of rocks (dry ones), roots, twists and quick up/downs. These shoes are great for this terrain. If you want a shoe to wear to the mall or walking your local greenway, I don't recommend them. You will throw away good money as the soles will wear out super fast on hard surfaces. If you want an aggressive, light shoe that you can run or hike trails in, then this is your shoe! :)	2015-08-16

One nice aspect is that, with slots on both sides, this is a good card case for left-handed people.  Maybe you other lefties out there carry your wallets differently than me, but my last small wallet had card slots on only one side, and I would slide it into my right back pocket with the cards towards me and the slot openings up.  When I would pull it out of the pocket, the thing would be upside down.  If I put it in my pocket with the cards away from me and the outer slots up, it would come out of the pocket right side up but with the cards on the side away from me.  With this case, it will come out of either back pocket right-side up with your most-used cards on the side that faces you.  But if you are going to use it as a wallet, be aware that you are going to get *maybe* seven bills folded in half in the middle slot, and you might have to take the cards out to let the case be flexible enough to get the bills in.	2015-08-16

I transfer them from each pair of shoes to the next. They have held up SO well, both visually and functionally. I truly believe that my feet were saved by these insoles.  As a non-car-owner living in New York City, I do a TON of walking every single day. It wasn't until recently that I realized the reason that my feet hurt so badly is because I have a high arch. Granted, I do not wear extremely high end shoes with lots of padding and support built into them. These soles have helped so much already in the first few weeks that I have been using them. I wear size 12 shoes and the mens 11-12 fit in all of my shoes perfectly. I transfer them from pair to pair to pair so that I always have them in. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up buying another set of these insoles in the near future.	2015-08-16

I used to spend a lot of money on &#34;nursing shoes&#34; that would wear out in 6 months. One day I saw a pair of K-Swiss tubes on clearance and snatched them up for $35. Since then, I continue to purchase K-Swiss brand for work. They are a fraction of the cost of nursing shoes and are pretty comfortable.

Normally, I purchase cheesy, plastic & $5 sandals from stores for just &#34;throwing on&#34; or &#34;around the house.&#34; However, after getting back from a 3 week vacation in cheesy, low quality sandals, I realized that I needed a new pair. I had brought 3 pairs of sandals, and somehow, all 3 pairs managed to break. My sister had only brought her rainbows, and they remained in perfect condition. I saved up my money and bought these, and I have never been more satisfied with any shoes than these. I love these so much, and I wear them literally everywhere. They are so easy to just slip on and wear for a beach day or even a day at school or work. They are so perfect and I am extremely happy with this purchase. If you're looking for high quality, long lasting sandals, rainbows are for you.	2015-08-16

That means the straps on the front and the back come into play pretty much every time you put them on. The strap on my right shoe broke after 35 days, which means I can't send it back to Amazon. Instead I have to deal with the Keen warranty department, which is very slow. They want pictures and detailed product information, which is not readily available on the Amazon invoice. For example, they want a product code on a little plastic sticker that fell off the shoes after about a week of wearing them. So now I have a pretty expensive one-month-old shoe that is nearly impossible to put on my foot and am told I'll need to wait 15 work days to have my claim processed. They can then either send me a replacement pair (which I *hope* they will) *OR* send me a voucher. But here's the kicker: the voucher is for the amount I paid on Amazon (a little over eighty bucks) but can only be used on the Keen website (where this shoe costs over a hundred bucks + shipping). It's unclear whether they'll make me mail back the broken shoes. Anyway, not a great experience so far with this company. Hopefully I'll hear back from them soon and they'll agree to send me a replacement pair of shoes quickly.	2015-08-16

I had read these shoes ran big so I originally bought these in an 8 (my shoe size is 8.5) but they were huge. The 7 is a better fit. I had to purchase these after a running injury left me with a fallen arch in one foot and the podiatrist said no more flat sandals for me. These sandals offer the support I now need while being somewhat stylish.

The only issue I have with them is they don't block out sunlight as well as many other glasses.	2015-08-16

I am a nurse who spends up to 16 hours per shift on my feet. I have tried several dozen kinds of shoes over the years. Lunar glides are the only shoes that supports my arches and is cushy enough to help with my plantar fasciitis. I usually have several pairs at a time so I can wear a different pair each shift. Helps the shoes last longer and allows them to air out after wearing them all day. They are extremely light weight and he sole is flexible. I can wear shoes with a stiff sole. The mesh upper allows the shoe to be tied to an appropriate level of tightness without constricting the toes and upper foot; it also allows for airflow to keep feet cooler.	2015-08-16

I've since worn them to work several times since, too. Style & Co is not a brand I usually think of as making a super comfortable shoe, but these proved me wrong--a really pleasant surprise.

The leather is so soft and, a big plus, the ruching allows for a ballet flat &#34;look&#34; while still covering my problematic big toe joint -- a painful issue w/ most ballet flats. I purchased the smooth black leather, the blue shimmery nubuck, and the champagne -- I returned the latter (too gold for me) and bought another of the black and navy.

The first time I put these on my 2 year old, the pull tab on the back of the shoe broke off. What is the point of a pull tab to help put on the shoes if it can't take a little tug?? I knew they would be getting returned, but I wasn't sure if I should order a replacement or not. I decided to have him test wear them around the house, and he kept sitting down to take the shoe off, saying &#34;owie shoe.&#34; He is not particularly picky, so there must have been something inside the shoe rubbing his foot (I couldn't locate any irritant). But his reaction helped me decide to return these broken shoes and try a different slip on instead of a replacement.	2015-08-16

I only wore them for a few hours at a time so far, but no problems. I was worried they might be a little wide (which is what others said in their reviews), and while they are a little wider than my older pairs, I did not have any problems with them falling off, especially since I've worn them in warm/hot weather where feet are likely to swell a little.

Very comfortable and bought for oversea cruise trip since would be doing a lot of walking. I usually cannot wear any flat shoe or sandal for too long or my knees will hurt, but this shoe feels like you are walking on a cushion. Somehow it absorbs a lot of the impact from walking. It is also a pretty cute shoe as I like to be comfortable but not look like a grandma since I am fairly young! The part that goes in between your toe does take little getting used to at first and the strap has to be adjusted so that the back of the shoe does not rub too much against heal and cause a cut. Once adjusted properly, these shoes are comfortable. If you want comfortable but cute, this is a great shoe.	2015-08-16

With trepidation because my heels are narrow, I also ordered the C/D width.  Despite a hammer toe, a heel spur and plantar fasciitis, I walk dogs and chase grandchildren for miles.<br /><br />These shoes are the most comfortable I own.  My insert fits, my heels don't slip out, and the toe box is wide and high enough to make a hammer toe &#34;happy.&#34;<br /><br />My feet heat up quickly so I'd prefer mesh rather than leather and they are very white, but for my feet the pros far outweigh the cons and I would buy another pair.	2015-08-16

I have developed plantar fasciitis and it can be very hard to walk some days.  I did a ton of research on different orthotic companies to buy a pair of shoes from and Vionic seemed to have the best most consistent reviews. I was very hopeful when I purchased these slippers but I honestly did not think that they would work as good as some said, because after everything I have tried to relieve the pain, nothing has worked. I figured that these would be a bit of a wider slipper based on the reviews.  As soon as these arrived I tried them on. I could instantly feel pressure relieved from my heel. The arch of my foot did hurt a bit, but I think that is because I am so used to wearing flat shoes with zero support. I work them for a few hours then took them off and tried to walk around barefoot, boy oh boy did I instantly feel the difference. I could immediately feel the pain rushing back into my heel. These slippers are wider, but I prefer them that way so no complaints from me.  If you are like me and considering buying something to help out with foot pain, please do yourself a favor and purchase these. If they worked for me, I'm almost certain they can help you.  Updated: I've had these for a few days now and have worn them the entire day for the last two days. I honestly have noticed such a huge difference in the pain. It's not 100% gone, more like 75% better than what it was.	2015-08-16

But don't panic! Once they mold to your feet they're incredible. Wearing them in the shower a few times does wonders to speed up the process (I did wipe them dry after just in case the water would damage them, but I've also worn them in the rain since then with no issues so I really wouldn't worry about it)<br /><br />Yes they still seem expensive when you could probably buy fairly comfortable flip flops for $5, but more than comfort you're really paying for quality. I wore them for months and months while working abroad in some pretty crappy terrain, and through it all not a single stitch came loose. Meanwhile, I had a few pairs of cheap (albeit comfortable) flip flops with me and not a single pair lasted more than two weeks. The Rainbows not only lasted me the rest of the trip, but they're still the only flip flops I wear.<br /><br />When these fall apart (in a decade I'm guessing?) I will definitely buy another pair.	2015-08-16

I really like these shoes, they've become my new slip-on-and-go sandals for the warm weather. They're cute, and relatively comfortable.

They also provide no arch support so be wary of that.<br />Otherwise they're great though! Super cute, durable, look exactly the same as described, go great with any casual outfit.

They're OK shoes, they look stylish, but what else do you want for a pair of shoes that cost less than a pair of shoes from Walmart? Now seeing how they've lasted longer than most of the name brand shoes I've bought, for them to cost less that $20 is right up the alley. I go through shoes a lot, and shelling out $85 for a pair of shoes that wouldn't last but 4 months on average is not worth the time.	2015-08-16

Haven't got to wear the shoes as they are meant to, live in Texas and we are currently at 105 degrees. I need to wait until I get to the slopes next year. The shoes look high quality and I expect them to last for a long time. There is no doubt that you should absolutely get a few sizes bigger, I normally wear 10 1/2 and the ones I got are 12 and they still feel a little tight at the front, I'm hoping that they will break down a little as I wear them. Note that these are truly snow shoes, the padding is super warm and I start sweating really fast when I wear them inside the house, so if you are getting this as an option to go hiking on semi cold weather this will be a total overkill.	2015-08-16

I bought it to carry to meetings and when I serve at church because I have terrible migraines and need to have my medication handy at all times.  I was tired of hauling around a large purse or bag but wanted something I could keep on my person.  I looked at some more expensive Vera Bradley bags in a similar style and pattern but did not want to pay upward of $50.  I decided to give this bag a try as it is just as cute and much more economical.  It is perfect to hold two of my migraine shots (complete with their accompanying boxes), a small wallet, a few cosmetics and a phone; all of a woman's necessities!  The strap is very long and adjustable so you could use it on your shoulder as well as crossbody.  The strap is thick enough that it does not cut into your shoulders during wear.  There is a small outside pocket that zips and an inside pocket that zips as well as two pouch-like pockets on the inside that are edged with elastic.  The bag appears to be washable if need be, although I have not tried this and am not sure how the bow would fair in the wash.  This bag is small enough not to be obtrusive or bulky but large enough to carry your necessities.  I definitely recommend this bag!	2015-08-16

It was a size up from her actual size, but I wanted to give her room to grow, and despite them being a size too large, they have never given her any problems and she chooses these shoes above all others that she has on a daily basis. They're great for water and playground play--she actually says they &#34;have suction cups on the bottoms&#34; because the traction is so good for climbing on rocks and monkey bars and for running. She also likes to wear these with socks. They're an amazingly versatile shoe, and definitely have been our best purchase of sandals/summer shoes yet. All parts of the shoes have held up wonderfully, and I'm excited that we'll be able to use them for another summer or pass them on in good condition. She was excited when they arrived, because they really are a pretty shoe even while being designed for active-wear.	2015-08-16

The initial snug width across the foot is the basis for my one star deduction. Other than that, they are beautiful boots, sleek, and sophisticated. Other reviewers have complained that these are &#34;wide calf&#34; boots. I happen to have basically average calves that are on the thin side, and while there is room to spare in the calf area of these boots, they don't look bad at all. In fact, the little extra room will allow me to wear the boots with jeans tucked in. I do prefer a fitted look for my boots when wearing skirts, and thankfully, these really don't look baggy across my calves. They look fine.	2015-08-16

My feet hurt every day. I recently retired and bought these Fila shoes because they looked cute. Not only do my orthotics fit in them, they are MORE comfortable than the NB. They are light as a feather but have a springy sole that makes my new habit of power walking a joy. I have found out a heavy leather shoe does not equate to better support. Also, they have a nice roomy toe box in a regular width. I highly recommend this shoe!	2015-08-16

I was lucky to get the lightening deal so I find that it was worth the $25 dollars. I'm just sad that with one fall it already has a scratch on one lens that won't come off but it's completely unnoticeable from a distance. Also, wearing these sunglasses while looking at a smartphone doesn't work because the lenses are slightly polarized making the screen look wonky. They are also very lightweight which is perfect for wearing a long time. The case they came in is a little big but it fits in my purse comfortably and it protects the sunglasses very well.	2015-08-16

It is a medium gray, not to light or dark.   The heel is much like a cowboy boot heel, which I love. I have a number of Everybody shoes and they have all have the same characteristics - soft leather and classy look. The only reason I gave this particular shoe a 4 is the fact that the back is a little low on your foot. I feel like it may slip off if I am wearing a stocking or thin, sheer knee high sock.  They are a good fit for a narrow foot.  I generally wear a 7.5 or 8 N. The 8 fit perfectly	2015-08-16

I was a bit apprehensive about wearing them in on this trip, but my fears were short lived.  I could not believe how comfy they were and they literally did not hurt at all despite the miles and miles hiked that week.  I felt the traction immediately and the sizing was perfect.  I wear a 7 and I bought a 7.  The toe area was a bit wider offering a comfy step. The grey color is nice as well if you're looking for something not beige...most of these shoes are brown/beige which I can't stand. I HIGHLY recommend.	2015-08-16

The Tobacco color is detailed. It's perfect. I only have one issue, the shoe strings seem to be made out of a thin fragile leather, and rip in half very easily with a few ties. So, what I would suggest is that you leave the shoe tied permanently and use the zipper to get in and out of your shoe, because it would seem that the leathery shoe strings are just for show, or you could just buy some nice shoe strings that would go great with these shoes, other than that I have no complaints.  P.S. I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but it would appear that you have to sign for these shoes once they are delivered. It's a good thing I was home because the U.S. Postal woman began knocking on my door, and usually they just knock once to let you know you have a package. So, I looked out my peephole and I saw her begin to leave with my pacakge so I had to catch her before she left, and she had me sign for them. I thought that was interesting because I never had to sign for shoes or clothes or really anyting besides electronics, like a computer, laptop or a cell phone. Maybe it's because the shoes are considered up scale and are a bit pricey; I'm not sure, all I have to say is make sure your home when you order these specific shoes.	2015-08-16

They may get better after a longer break in period.  The shoe laces were a bit short too.  This may be due to my high arches. These shoes do not have much arch support for high arches.  I pulled out the real thin insoles that have no arch.  Replaced them with Dr. Scholl's Active Series  insoles with stiff arch supports.  The shoes are pretty great now, need to get some longer laces next.	2015-08-16

Finding a shower shoe was a lot harder than I thought because a lot of the sandals have padded/cotton on the inside of the strap, so it stays wet all day. These shoes seem like they'll last me a long time and seem to fit as expected (I wear a size 9 in just about every brand of shoe, and a size 9 in these fit me perfect). If you're looking for something fancy with lots of padding and cushioning, these probably aren't what you're looking for. But if you need a good all-around sandal, then you cant go wrong with these guys!	2015-08-16

The bag is much larger than I expected since the description states that it is 11 inches wide. The front pocket is 11 inches wide and in theory the rest of the bag can be attributed to depth. Unfortunately, it actually hangs at 17 inches wide because the design of the zipper forces the shape of the bag to be 17 inches. It is very large. Also, it smelled very, very bad. I might have tried airing it out if it had been the size listed.	2015-08-16

These are the second pair of spikeless golf shoes I have ordered on-line and are glad that they fit very well right out of the box.

Also less expensive investment, as you don't need to replace the spikes and are better for the golf course.	2015-08-16

I have received multiple compliments on them (grey shoe/orange accents).  They are also fairly comfortable, although I think they probably work a little better from an aesthetic standpoint.  I think I would be a little sore if I was walking/standing around in these for an entire day, but I am pretty comfortable when going out for a few hours at a time.  (dinner, hanging out, etc).  My only other minor quibble is that there is a tiny area of separation at the toe, but that is hardly noticeable and could probably be easily fixed with a dot of superglue or something.	2015-08-16

And then the laser lady looked initially. I thought they were really cute, and exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />Looking more closely at them, I was a little disappointed. There is this white dish around the wedge heel, and although it's nice very bright, it's still there. It's a little annoying and I tried to clean it off but it is not at all.<br /><br />I put them on just to see if I could maybe do with it and walked around in them for a few minutes. They are a little big, so they slip off as my heel whenever I am walking, so that's really annoying. But what's even worse, it digs any to my ankle bone online and even after wearing them for only five minutes, I had that red mark. I'm pretty sure every woman knows exactly what I'm talking about.<br /><br />They really are cute, and I hate to send them back because I don't know if getting a smaller size is even going to fix it. I may have to talk to you as a company just to see if they have any thoughts on it.<br /><br />For the price, it's not a horrible pair of shoes. - the fact that there's the white film, and they dig into my ankle. If I put a insert into them, maybe they will fit a little bit better, but I just don't know if I want to do all that.	2015-08-16

Once a year I buy him a pair of rainbows.  They are stiff for a bit until they break in to the shape of his foot (couple of weeks).  You can't beat the quality of these shoes and Rainbow will replace the sandals, should they break (which they never have).  My husband wears them daily (we live in Florida) and when they get to the point where the sole under his big toe is wearing down, I buy him a new pair (once a year).  These shoes are durable and if you're trying to get past spending over $50 on flip flops, just remember they will last at least a year if you wear them daily.  If you wear them seasonally, I'm sure that you'll get multiple years out of these sandals.  The best part, they NEVER go out of style.  :)	2015-08-16

Just be sure to wear thick high socks until they've softened up or you'll get nasty blisters. My pair took the better part of a month to fully break in and honestly I love them.	2015-08-16

They're ultra-cushioned, sparkly, cute, and the best part is that I haven't gotten &#34;flip-flop-foot&#34; (those little blisters you get near your arches when your flip-flop straps rub on you) or anything like it a single time with these. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a cute and comfortable foam sandal.	2015-08-16

These appear more rugged than my first Muck boots that had a very soft sole which wore out quickly from &#34;non-skid&#34; on boat decks and the beige color stained.  I bought them to primarily wear when saltwater fishing in the Pacific off  the So Calif and Mexican coast. ( Taking them to the snow or mud would be a second purpose.) I often fish from party boats and the decks are frequently awash in saltwater hose spray rinsing away bait pieces, tuna blood,  etc, and less often in splashes of saltwater wave-spray.  These are high enough to keep me dry and the foot bed is stable enough to keep my footing.  They are easy on/off.  I recently finished a 5-day trip wearing these all day while fishing (rubber sandals when not fishing) and with fresh socks each day I had no foot problems.  These are &#34;keepers.&#34;	2015-08-16

I have owned lots of Keens and have never been disappointed- plus they always fit right. So if I were going to try a &#34;Chelsea&#34; pull-on boot, it made sense to start with a brand I knew and trusted. I ordered the same 9.5(D) size as all my Keens and waited for the box to show up on my porch (which happened the very NEXT day even though I just used my usual Prime shipping- Amazon logistics are incredible!!). First: I wasn't sure what texture the (black) leather would be. The description lists &#34;full grain leather&#34; (which means slick & polished in the case of Keen NoPo's two versions), but based on the pictures it could go either way. I was pleased to find that they are somewhere in the middle of the texture spectrum (smooth but not polished) and really solid looking with that thick sole and aggressive tread. They seemed a little loose when I tried them on, but when I added the Sof Sole insole that I always use, they were nice and snug. The first several days I wore them around the house for a few hours in the evenings to be sure I didn't need to return them (another great Amazon feature) and they quickly passed. That weekend I gave them the real world test doing errands, a night out, Mass on Sunday and lots of walking during a picnic in the park. I couldn't be more pleased- comfortable, not too heavy, no ankle rubbing, snug fit and great looking in their simplicity! I don't notice any of the left/right sizing imbalance issues mentioned by some reviewers (which had made me a little hesitant to order these), but that may just be good luck if it's a production issue. So now that I'm sure these work-- and do so better than I even hoped, I believe I'll keep an eye on the &#34;peanut&#34; color price or maybe switch over to the laced version for that. I'm very pleased and would recommend these without hesitation. I hope this helps anyone pondering the purchase!hope this helps anyone pondering the purchase!	2015-08-16

I took them to the pool, around the house, and on a trip where I wore them all day, every day.  Zero foot issues, very comfortable, and supported my arches perfectly.  I wear a women's US 9 and these fit correctly.  I also have a wide metatarsal and can wear a B or D depending on the brand.  These are wide but are prefect for me.

I have had Many compliments.  The straps have held up for over a year with daily use, and I carry a heavy wallet, two phones, and my iPad2 along with other items. The only thing that could be improved is the medium length straps that are hooked with the small handles are too close together for me to use them as a shoulder strap.  So I use the long strap on my shoulder, or a carry by the handles in my hand. BTW, my bag still looks new, even though I use it daily.	2015-08-16

This is a nice pair of shoes and arrived before time and was well packed on arrival. The only issue is with the sizing. I usually wear size 5 (and have narrow feet) but reading reviews on other shoes from this company, had a feeling and had ordered a size up, but even size 6 is somewhat tight! It would've been better if I bought a size 7, I guess! The seller needs to probably mention to buy at least 2 sizes up! 1 star less for the sizing issue, other than which I like the shoes.

This was my 4th and I went for a more formal (meeting) style.<br /><br />Unfortunately these are disappointing. Like the other ones, they aren't very durable. The last pairs lasted less than a year and these won't last beyond that. Already cracking severely at the bends.<br /><br />The worst part is they slip on wet and oily conditions. This is almost as important as being steel toe. In my entire career I may have slipped 3 times. Since wearing these I have slipped more than 3 times and have to walk around.<br /><br />The last thing I'll say is these were slightly tighter and breaking them in is taking very long.<br /><br />I would not recommend but they are 3 stars because they are still better than other brands (doc marten, wolverine).	2015-08-16

I really didn't know what I was looking for and I relied heavily on the positive reviews when I decided to go with a pair of these. I was not disappointed.  Keep in mind, as other people have said, they do run a big large.  I'm normally a size 10 and I went with a 9.5 which worked pretty well.  (Keep in mind you'll want to be wearing somewhat thick socks and your feet do swell with physical activity).  My Ariats received a lot of rough wear during my trip (40 miles of very steep hiking in a week) but they held up very well.  I just walked to work a couple times to break them in before the trip (two 4 mile walks) and got a few small blisters here and there (as you can expect with any long hikes).  They are extremely light weight.  The package they arrived in weighed 3 lbs total, box and boots included.  I could not believe how light they were.  One small complaint: they don't breathe very well.  This didn't pose any huge problems to me during my trip, but I did notice my feet getting very warm while I was first breaking them in.  Honestly though, it's a small flaw in the light of a solid pair of boots for a very decent price.  Go for it.	2015-08-16

As always, these Clarks are so comfortable that you can wear them right out of the box-no breaking in required. I ordered a 6 1/2 (sometimes I wear a 6) and I'm glad I did as they were just a fit.

These shoes are so darling! They really have that retro oxford feel without being too super hot for warm weather. I received a lot of compliments on them as well. Unfortunately, they're super flimsy.

I'm tempted to get another pair, even, but knowing it was only a matter of time until they met the same fate, how could I? :/ I would take them to a cobbler if I was sure I wouldn't get laughed out of the place.

I'd only had these boots a week and hiked about 4 miles in them before the backpack trip.  So no break in was done.  Nevertheless - the fit was very good - no blisters at all - none - despite the long days in the boots.  The boots are light weight - yet the support was fine.  They seemed to wear well - but it is hard to be completely certain after only130 miles.  The soles have a  good rubber composition - it is a more &#34;sticky&#34; rubber that the other boots I tried or my old boots.  This was a great feature when scrambling several rock peaks along the trip.  The &#34;stickiness&#34; of the rubber did not seem to affect wear - the wear was pretty minimal after this trip - comparable to my other boots on previous trips of similar length. I stepped in the river to pull out a fellow hiker who had slipped off a log - one boot filled completely with water.  I drained the water and changed socks and by the end of the day, some 6 hours later, the boot was dry - I was surprised. I think these boots dry more quickly than several of my older pairs of Asolo boots.  The Gore Tex worked well - we had one day of light rain and it had rained heavily overnight and the vegetation was wet adjacent the trail.  Then the same day I slipped off a slippery rock while getting water and stepped into the shallow creek.  Nonetheless - my feet stayed dry.  I think these boots are better in this area than my last two Asolo pairs which are also Gore Tex.  (Not all Gore Tex is created equal-- it works better in some boots than others - for some reason).  However - this year's rain day was not as bad as the last three years have been on this Paysaten trip - so I can't sayfor sure that these boots are better as far as water resistance.  My only rather minor criticism is the lacing.  The lacing hooks are a little difficult to catch with the laces - one has to watch carefully or you will find that you've only partially seated the lace in the hook.  I can do my old Asolo boots while half asleep and the same with the Asolo and Lowa boots I tried as comparison when I ordered these boots.  So Scarpa could do better there - talk to your engineers....  But this is a mild annoyance.  Also - the laces are rather thin and probably will have to be replaced after a year or so - and often I can get 3+ years from a pair of laces.  Overall - I think these are a nice pair of boots - well worth the price - and very comfortable with no break in time - and I really like the sticky rubber of the soles.	2015-08-16

Presumably, if you're looking at CrossFit shoes, you're looking for shoes that work for lifting. I noticed an improvement in my lifts after receiving these. I specifically saw a difference in my squats as I wasn't thrown forward onto my toes as is the case with my old cross trainers. I do switch to my running shoes for cardio-heavy WoDs, but for under $50, these were a great purchase. The only reason I'm not giving them a solid five is that the pink stripe has started to fade and they are a tad clown-shoey. But hey, you're not wearing these for their appearance. ;)<br /><br />I wouldn't say they run small, but if you're between sizes (I'm a 9.5 or a 10 depending) go up, not down. I was on the fence, but I'm glad I went with the 10; the 9.5 would've been too small.	2015-08-16

All I can say is - it is messy!  Heated the can as directed in a small pot of water, it melted OK.  But getting it out of the can while it is melted (ie hot) is difficult - I used a paint brush about 1-1/2 inches wide, it was hard to get it into & out of the can.  If you use a narrower brush you won't pick up as much wax.  Another problem - I waited until it was an 80+ degree day, had to work inside though because that's where my stove is.  Couldn't take the stuff outside because the water wouldn't stay hot enough to keep the wax melted.  Another problem - as soon as the brush hit the wax & I started to apply it to the jacket (Barbour waxed cotton), the wax began to harden.  Tried heating the wax (on the jacket) with my hair drier - that worked somewhat.  Even with the 80+ degree heat, it wax started to harden up on the jacket.  Then tried using an old washcloth to dip into the can - that worked better than the brush, but it was messy also.  Best method was to heat the jacket, in small patches of course, WHILE applying the wax from the washcloth - because I could heat not only the cloth but the wax on the cloth also, at the same time.  There are still patches of wax in spots, now hanging the jacket in the hot sun and going to wipe it in/down with another lint free cloth.  I always wanted a Barbour waxed cotton jacket & saved up for it. Next time I am saving up to have the jacket waxed by the company!  Not worth the mess!  There is enough wax in the can to do my entire jacket (hip length) but I only did the shoulders, arms and just past the pockets on the front and most of the back.  There is enough wax left in the can to do the rest of the jacket.	2015-08-16

So I thought I'd try these loafers. A couple of thoughts if you're considering:<br /><br />- I like the look. Casual, but subtle and classy. They look especially good with jeans.<br />- These loafers aren't really navy blue. To me, they really look gray with a hint of blue. Maybe Cool Gray is the right thing to call them.<br />- These don't seem to have the really nice, cushy bottoms like my other Clarks. It's okay, but not pillowy soft.<br />- The suede is a pain to clean, and I gave up. I spilled some water on them, and I could never really get the stains out. I tried a few of the different methods suggested online, but none really worked completely. So now these shoes rarely get worn.<br /><br />So, If you're okay with suede and the color gray, then these aren't too bad.	2015-08-16

Other reviewers have pointed out that the shoes don't drain very well after running through water. That's true. Also, the traction is great, but can cary mud with them so when transitioning to a smooth surface in an OCR (any kind of verticle wall) you'll have a slick hold. Other reviewers pointed out that the arch traction is great for rope climbing, but I've found the opposite. All in all, they work great on the trail, and have stood up to some beating on the course.	2015-08-16

I looked at so many RFID wallets and finally decided on this one.  I LOVE it!  It holds everything I need, is attractive and fits in my purse.  I like the way it's 'trifold'--I put my credit cards in the center part so it's extra safe.  The only drawback I could possibly see in this wallet is that the place where you put change is zippered.  I've always carried the French style of wallet where the place you put change is secured by metal pieces (sorry, I don't know how to describe it!).  Anyway, that's not really important to me anymore because I only carry a few quarters for emergencies---these days I use either paper dollars or the credit card.  As for the RFID protection, I tried some of those little sleeves that you insert into the slots in your wallet.  They are made basically of paper with a thin foil-like liner.  I bought 4 of them at a local store for $10.  That was not a wise buy.  Within a week, the sleeve was getting crinkled and worn when I pulled out my credit card.  I wouldn't recommend those sleeves.  Rather, just buy a wallet like this one and ALL your cards (including your drivers license) will be protected!	2015-08-16

They started Sunday delivery out here in the sticks of central Illinois. GO AMAZON !!!<br /><br />These sandals are very comfortable and decently priced. It is always a gamble buying shoes or sandals-flip-flops online. I wear a 10 1/2 and ordered an 11. They fit perfectly with no room to spare. If I were to order them again I would order an 11 1/2. The heel of my foot does not overhang the sandal but it is very close. I would say my heel is exactly even with the back of the sandal. I wear a wide shoe more because of aged joints than necessarily a wide foot. There is no room to spare on the width either. I did not see any way to order a wider flip-flop from them though. The arch support seems very good and they were comfortable the first time I put them on. Initially they did not seem to be very grippy.  They were kind of slippery on my linoleum floor. but after an hour or so of wearing them they started to grip the ground better. They are very lightweight, look good, and appear to be well made. All in all I would buy them again. Just note that you must order a full size bigger than your normal size, and they probably will not fit a person with a wide foot.	2015-08-16

I bought a pair of shoes that were regular width and i typically wear wide width shoes.  I was able to stretch out both shoes using this unit.  I'm not sure the solution is much more than moisture - I get the sense that you could spray with water to get the same pliability in the leather.  You won't get a size, or even a half size of stretch but it certainly works to make snugly fitting shoes fit well.	2015-08-16

The 3 Zip Cosmetic case itself is fine, but it's way too small to adequately replace the one I have, that I've been using the last few years as a wallet.

It fits in length and it fits across the toes, which I always have issues with. However, they seem to think that wide across the toes means a wide heel.

I've had these for over a year and I've worn them maybe three times.

Had the model before and loved them, so I asked for these, and was disappointed in them.  First off, the insoles were paper thin to start with, and I shredded them within the first 2 months.  Replaced with combat boot insoles and carried on. However, within 3 months, the outside edge of the  toe cup (right where it says &#34;North Face&#34;) had cut a hole into the mesh of the shoe, that degraded extremely quickly and now pokes through to my sock (compromising any water resistance they may have held.)<br /><br />The shoes overall are fairly comfortable once you replace the insoles, so it is a crying shame to give them such a low review.  But for $110 shoes, they have lasted less than half a year with regular use (not even heavy duty camping/trail running) and beyond that, they are slick as snot once you get into any wet tile or linoleum floors, not to mention that I have nearly lost a front tooth when I slipped on a rock as I was crossing a stream.  Sole lugs provide great traction in mud and dirt, but will betray you as soon as you set foot on any smooth surfaces.  Would not buy again at this price.	2015-08-16

It arrived in a very timely fashion, however, the bag has a strong chemical odor and the key embellishment fell right off when I took it out of the package. I had to leave the bag outside on my front porch to try to rid it of its odor, but it is still there, just not quite as strong. I super glued the key fob back together. For the price, this manufacturer needs to pay attention to theses details.	2015-08-16

I normally wear an 8, or 8.5 with thick socks, but this size 9 works best for me. I needed the larger size for the width in the toe, and use an insole to make the rest of it it fit better. I have high arches, so nothing ever feels like 'good arch support' to me, but the ankle support serves to resist my ankle pronation rather well. They are flexible, nicely waterproof, and easy-on-easy-off, so they've become my 'go-to' dog-walking shoes for wet grass or cool days. A bit sweaty, as I'd expect from waterproof shoes, but comfy otherwise. I've had them for a year, and although I don't wear them every day, and seldom all day, I wear them often and they've held up well. I didn't care for the white top-stitching, so I took a red Sharpie marker to it - stylin'!	2015-08-16

After reading all the other reviews on this brand of slipper, I was nervous about them being too small as so many other customers complained about. I did not have this experience at all. My daughter wears a size 3 1/2 tennis shoe which leaves a thumb's width of growning room at the big toe. I ordered these slippers in size 3/4 and they fit well enough to stay on her feet but are big enough that they will fit her until she is truly a size 4. I always replace my daughter's shoes before her toes reach the very end and I don't necessarily go by what the foot measuring tool at the shoe store reads. Instead I see what she feels most comfortable walking in. Her foot is also very wide at the toes. I don't know if this approach is why I had better results but I'm very happy with the slippers. I actually bought her 2 different styles of these slippers, one pair did not have elastic at the sides. One pair is for school & one is for home. The only difference between the two is the pair with elastic at the sides are a little wider around her foot. If your child has a very narrow foot you might want to look at the styles without elastic sides. As far as quality and appearance these are the best made and cutest slippers that are actually functional that I've found. I am extremely happy with my purchase and am glad I did not let the negative reviews keep me from buying them. I hope this review is helpful as far as determining what size and style to buy for your child.	2015-08-16

I recently bought the 'Delirium Aviator' & the 'Pallavicini' models of the iSKi sunglasses, & for cheap @ $7.00/pr., & they are decent enough.  Although I do own an older original model of iSki sunglasses bought in CO back around 2000, probably for around $15.  And the older model (no actual model name listed on the sunglass frame) has very nice Rose-Colored Lens in them, tinted more heavily on the top & bottom portion of the lens.  Naturally, the Rose Tinting accentuates and intensifies most colors, which is very pleasant.  Neither the Delirium of Palla frames are exactly the preferred shape of my originals, but fairly close.  My originals had sort of that traditional Aviator lens shape, (in plastic frames) but less tear-dropped shaped, more flattened on the bottom, giving them a slightly smaller frame & lens.  I have loved my original iSKI's & have always been afraid of losing or breaking them, which is why I took a chance and bought these newer models of the ISKI brand.  And the new models do have the Silver/Reflective lens as do the old models,  I like the fact that these iSKI sunglasses don't have those wrap-around frames which gives me the look of a glassy-eyed outer-space alien, one of those Greys.  I prefer the old school RayBan frame styles, which these have.<br /><br />My only complaint about +90% of the sunglasses traditionally found on Sunglass Racks is that they rarely offer any sunglasses with darker tinted lens.  My eyes are sensitive to very bright sunlight, and if I am skiing, the snow is extremely bright at times & hurts my eyes with most models of sunglasses.  Luckily, I have found a couple pairs of truly dark lens sunglasses and revert to using those on blindingly  sunny days.  Right now I just use the iSKI models for driving, if it is not terrifically bright & sunny.<br /><br />I have a pair of sunglasses that I got for free with some product long ago, they are called 'Happy Cat' sunglasses w/smiling cat face on one stem, & the trademark &#34;Twins&#34; on the other ear stem, and these Happy Cat's have the some of the darkest lens I have ever used, but they are truly perfect for sun bleached days.  Although the Happy Cat sunglasses look like kid's sunglasses, one stem bright yellow, the other stem white, the frame red.  These TWIN Happy Cats were made in Taiwan, I wish I could find another pair......<br /><br />I also have a pair of Italian made sunglasses, made by L.G.R. (Freetown model I believe?), that were given to me by a friend who said the lenses (dark greenish tint) were way too dark for him, but they are perfect for me in harsh sunlight.  However, the TWIN 'Happy Cats' actually have an even darker tint, grey.<br /><br />I sort of wish the new owners of ISKI made some models with darker lens tints, and maybe sturdier frames, I know I would be willing to pay more for darker lenses, mirroring not necessary, in mostly traditionally shaped frames.

So I received these sunglasses after ordering in the green color, shown with that cotten candy pink hue.

They were delivered very quickly and in great packaging, the glasses were in a nice high quality sunglass case. I will wear these sunglasses because they seem to be of good quality to. My greatesr disappointment would be the difference in the color of the lenses shown and the color I actuay received. These sunglasses are also VERY VERY dark.	2015-08-16

Heel cup takes getting used-to. Still not zero drop.  Otherwise awesome!	I wear 11-1/2 W Belleville Flight Boots, but the TR103s were too small in size 12W, so I returned them and got 13W.  They are awesome.  The sole is flexible enough to roll it up in your hand, but tough enough to protect your feet from rough ground.  I would only point out two areas for improvement:  As has been commented on, the heel cup is unusually stiff around the achilles tendon.  It is made of several layers of leather, and it feels uncomfortable until you break them in, and even then they feel odd when you first put them on.  I wear Vermont Darn Tough Wool boot socks, so it doesn't bother me, but I haven't tried them for a long ruck.  I wear them everyday for 12 Hours plus, but I'm in an office job.  The second minor gripe is that they have a 2mm heel drop.  Yeah, I know, that's less than 1/10th of an inch, but when I switch from my Minimus running shoes, I notice it.  I will switch to a true zero-drop boot as soon as one is available.  In the meantime, this is my favorite.	2015-08-16

They're actually more comfortable than I expected, though I really wouldn't suggest throwing them on even for errands unless you have little slip socks underneath - the denim rubs up against my toes and creates irritation, otherwise.<br /><br />I normally have pretty narrow feet, and these are more wide than other slip-ons I've ever bought, but overall they're comfortable and a good value. They're great to be on my feet through the whole school day, and match to just about any outfit you could throw together.	2015-08-16

Even though I had never broken them in, they were comfortable right from the start. They were perfect for getting in and out of water and walking on rocky surfaces. I even like the little reflector tags so you can spot them quickly with a flashlight outside your tent at night. You can cinch them up very tightly if walking in muck. My only wish is that they dried a little faster, but really, I can't imagine any shoe of this type would dry any faster than these would. All in all, they seem very well built, and I hope they last me for many river trips to come! They are also nice enough for wearing around town.	2015-08-16

They have held up great to this day, they just don't hold a shine anymore so I decided to get a new pair of duty boots. There was a slight problem with the zipper on one of the boots, it would unzip but if I tied the laces around the top of the boot there was no problem - I just had to tie them instead of using the zippers. This zipper issue started after about two or three years of patrol use in Alaska. No complaints there.<br /><br />I was so pleased with Striker 2's that I bought another pair. I noticed that the zippers on the model had changed. This zipper broke after one or two days.  There has obviously been some cost cutting going on and it is very apparent when you compare the pair of boots I had first to the new ones. When I buy Danner boots I expect to pay a couple hundred dollars and get five years of them.<br /><br />I would not buy another pair of these boots. I will be going with the non-zippers. I don't know if the durability of zipper boots is just not a feasible thing or if these are just cheap, but I would not recommend them.	2015-08-16

I only wear these occasionally, maybe once or twice a week.  Sometimes not even that much.  First and foremost, these are NOT Black, they are a dark brown color, so if you want black boots do not buy these.  Second, I just noticed a large slit lengthwise through the sole of my left boot, halfway up the sole.  This happened on my last pair of Dr. Martens, but only after 3 years of wear.  I don't know if I'm just unlucky or if Dr. Martens quality is just dropping.  However I can no longer wear these for fear of completely ripping the sole lengthwise.<br /><br />I've included a picture so you can see what I'm talking about.	2015-08-16

I usually wear expensive MJ polarized sunglasses, so I was wary of trying these. I got them in and they came in a nice box with a bag for the glasses to be stored in (which doubles as a lens cleaner).  They fit really well on my face and do a great job of blocking out the bright summer sun. I wore these by the pool for a pool party and got lots of complements! They are not heavy and did not hurt the bridge of my nose or my ears. I got the brown ones, and I just love the color of them against my skin. As I began to sweat, the glasses did not slide off of my nose..I have a couple of pairs that I constantly have to push back into place, and there is nothing more aggravating! They made colors more vivid and did not give me a headache like some plastic lenses I have used.  These sunglasses passed my test! Give them a try!

With a latch it doesn't fall out before I clean it out.<br /><br />To satisfy the fit questions asked for this review, I found wearing it rather difficult; particularly with only one, I was trending to walk in circles. I will add that as a shoe, it is hard to keep on the foot, fits poorly, and is not particularly durable.	2015-08-16

I will probably wear socks for the first few weeks until they are fitting more comfortably, but then I know they will go everywhere with me just like the others.

By way of background, I have &#34;funny-shaped&#34; size 12 feet that don't feel comfortable in most shoes. I am also a bit arthritic, which makes tying shoelaces a little difficult. As a result, I wear flip-flops for most of the year, both because they are comfortable and because they are easy to put on and to remove. The biggest drawbacks of my flip-flop habit are that I live in the Northwest (which means my feet get cold or wet in the fall and winter), and that the open toes don't provide any protection against hazards on the ground.  I was amazed to discover that these shoes fit well. They are snug, but not tight. Even better, they are easy to put on by simply putting my foot in and wiggling it a bit. I am able to walk the dogs, go shopping, or other activities that involve being on my feet with no foot discomfort at all. I wore them through airport security and had no problem at all removing them and putting them back on. I'm definitely getting another pair when these ones wear out!	2015-08-16

The color was perfect, the size was just right, and I was thrilled to have a quality handbag that complemented my style. But unfortunately those feelings didn't last long. After about 2 months, the lining began to tear. After about 3 months, the rubber or whatever material that lines the edges of the bag began to come off. Then a couple weeks ago, the straps finally gave in and broke. I attempted to fix them but it was useless. I take excellent care of everything I own, especially handbag and shoes, so I was disappointed to realize that no matter what I did, this bag wasn't going to last. I do not recommend purchasing a product from this company and wish I could be refunded for the purchase price.	2015-08-16

I do.  I bought them in my real size 81/2 wide.  They felt great when I first put them on.  However, in about an hour, the upper edge was hurting across my large toe so I will not wear them more than 3 or 4 hours.  I attribute this problem to my bunions.  If you don't have them, don't worry.  Also if you have a narrow heel you might have a problem.  The strap was large on me.  Fortunately there was one hold to tighten it and that was enough.	2015-08-16

I usually wear a size 7w, but the length and width were perfect. I morning they arrived I threw them on and ran errands all day and my feet felt great. Note: In the picture the red looked pink, but it is red. Only the grommet has a rose color, but the hem of my jeans covers it. Well worth the price!	2015-08-16

I only buy adidas,, Merrell or Timberland shoes as I need extra arch support. Also, those seem to always fit as expected so I can order on-line with confidence. This is my 2nd pair of the Greensider golf shoes. I liked the first pair so much, I bought another par in a different color. I virtually always walk the 18 holes when I play and I find these comfortable to walk in, esp on the hot summer days. I don't wear them when it's wet on the course as I'm not sure hot water tight they'd be.	2015-08-16

US	38400098	R9XB6R6P5DOWP	B00LLYEA1E	555838670	UGG Men's Alamar	Shoes	5	2	2	N	N	All around great!	I bought several Ugg Alamars because they fit great. Two years ago, I destroyed my left heel bone, and even after reconstructive surgery, my left foot is and always will be disfigured. Alamars don't come in half sizes so it's not surprising when buying shoes online that they might be too long or two narrow. When I wear the right shoe, there's definitely some room between the back of my heel and the heel of the shoe. But these are slip-ons and that extra space doesn't bother me at all. The best part is I can fit my much wider left foot into the shoe. The shoes come with two inserts/soles: fleece and leather. The fleece adds extra comfort and is surprisingly cool, even in Arizona's heat.	2015-08-16
