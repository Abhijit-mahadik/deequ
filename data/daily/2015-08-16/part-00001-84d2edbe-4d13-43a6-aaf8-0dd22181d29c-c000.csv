I purchased this Nintendo 2DS to replace a Nintendo DS my child broke.  We already have a blue one and got the red one this time so they can each have a different color.  They enjoy playing with it when they are allowed to play games on it.  I like how they can pretty much put any ds or 3ds game in there to play.  My only complaint would be that you just receive a download code for Mario Kart 7.  You have to download it from the nintendo store.  For some reason, I thought I was getting the actual game.  This would have been better so the other kids can join in and play when they sync their 2DS together.  Also, if they wanted to play the Mario Kart 7 game, they had to play it on this red 2DS where the game was downloaded.  They can't play it on the other 2DS.  They like to use the 2DS, but don't really play with the Mario Kart game because of the not being able to sync problem.	2015-08-16

Not happy with it at all because it does NOT work as advertised. It appears to be full of<br />bugs. It will not connect or synchronize with any of the Saitek Flight Simulator components. I purchased X-Plane 10 (8 discs),<br />Windows 8, 64-bit, with new PC dedicated to setting up a permanent flight simulator. So far, the X-Plane software is a dud. I am<br />a student pilot. I purchased X-Plane and the Saitek components to help me with flight training in a Cessna 172. I am extremely<br />disappointed. Specific issues: X-Plane does not calibrate, connect with, or synchronize with Saitek Flight Simulator yoke,<br />rudder pedals, throttle quadrant or trim wheel. Once operating, the simulated Cessna 172 does not move, does not gain<br />air speed, and again, none of the flight controls will work with this software. The built-in chronograph in the yoke cannot be<br />changed to reflect &#34;real&#34; time. The software (under &#34;Buttons, Basic&#34;) do not work to set the 9 toggle switches on the Cessna-<br />style push/pull throttle-mixture component (they don't accept any X-Plane programming functions). Attempts to contact<br />X-Plane for tech support via phone and email were fruitless -- no response, no help. A check with Sporty's Pilot Shop suggests<br />this is a bargain-basement software system that many folks have had problems with. (I purchased the X-Plane from Amazon).	2015-08-16

The only thing that disappoints me about it, is that I already had rechargeable batteries for my xbox one controllers but I can use it on this charger because it only accepts the battery packs that it came with.

The game is a humorous and pretty action and gore filled fighting game that gives scantily clad fem warriors a whole new meaning. Obviously it's not meant to be taken seriously as it follows a similar way that Bayonneta is played though with this you have a choice between four female characters each with their own unique fighting method and some weaknesses too. The games graphics are alright befitting the higher PS3 quality but not really with any of the more recent PS4 games like The Last Of Us,Tomb Raider:DE and the like but still good for what it is. What's laughable is that you have some naysayers complaining about the near nudity and weird clothing with the female characters and you have to wonder if they even bothered checking into the games background and basic info of the game before buying it. I was able to get the game on PSN for $40 and that's probably what the game is actually worth though again at the end it's the personal choices of the individual gamer who is getting the game so I'd advise trying a demo if possible or at a least check out a few online demo trailers and clips before finalizing your choice.<br /><br />Unlike the 2006 released here in NA this game has both a Japanese and English voice cast for the characters and personally I feel that both the subbed and dubbed actresses did a fantastic job voicing their character roles in the game. So for fans of game like Bayonneta and the like this is one to really think about adding to your PS4 game library.	2015-08-16

Primarily the chord and the analog sticks. but also have noticed issues with the triggers as well. Other issues include my PC not entering into idle state (activating screensaver) when one of these controllers are plugged in to the system. regardless of power settings. This is a problem with all three of the afterglow controllers I own.<br /><br />Lastly, A HUGE CONCERN: The USB plug on this controller will cause physical damage to a PC USB port due to the weight of the plug and of the cord itself. these plugs are designed in the same manner as the ones designed for the Xbox 360. on the 360 you have a piece of plastic about a half of an inch away from the female port that supports the weight of the controllers plug. on 99% of PC's you don't have that. Which can very quickly lead to a loosening of the USB port from the PCB board. which can result in both critical and catastrophic USB issues and hardware failure.<br />If you still intend on purchasing this controller I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you purchase a USB EXTENSION CORD that can be secured in such a way so that this controller does not cause severe and unnecessary physical strain on your USB ports.	2015-08-16

It also comes with different hands,feet, and other things you can put on it to change to the pose you would like it to have. one problem I had with the extra pieces was trying to put the mask you can put in it. it does manage to stay put, but it doesn't feel like it is solid there.

The worst part about this game is how much &#34;grinding&#34; you have to do and then they come out with a new update that completely devalues the weapon and gear you worked so hard for. They can't figure out the premise for destiny so they keep changing it realizing that other companies and other games such as Warframe &#34;get it&#34;. So they constantly try to keep up. But at the end of the day they're far behind. Im sick of all the time I've spent in this game to be wasted because they're still trying to figure out how to game works over a year later. Each time they completely change the game-- like they will again for the Taken King out fall 2016-- it makes me despise this game more. All love has been lost for this company and this game. Lastly the icing on top is their inability to prevent cheating and their lazy way of fixing that which is by banning people for few days rather than fixing the exploits in their game that THEY created that causes the cheating to begin with. Bungie-- you really need to wake up.	2015-08-16

The sound quality is top notch surround and will definitely put you right in the game  (you'll be able to hear bullets flying past you in some shooters). It has even taken over as my go-to earphones when I'm listening to music at home, although it's a little too bulky for on-the-go listening. The microphone comes as an attachment, which allows you to use it in any device you want and has great playback quality and is sensitive while not picking up background noise. The attachment for the Xbox one controller is top notch and has a standard headphone jack plug-in, which means that you can listen to game volume even with just normal ear buds, and it easily hooks up to a computer and Xbox 360 too (although save your manual for the 360 plug-in instructions, it's a bit of a weird set up involving the back usb ports on the console). The only complaints I can say about the product are the aforementioned Xbox 360 adapter and that the actual headset might sit kind of tightly on your head when you first take it out of the box.	2015-08-16

Estimated arrival date: Wednesday, August 19th Actual arrival date: Friday, August 21st  I only include this information for factual reference for other buyers. I did not mind the package having a slightly delayed delivery.   Now, onto the product.  I'm glad I bought these. They're fantastic for grip and a really great price. The different heights and designs of the grips make for plenty of ways to personalize your controller experience and with the ability to remove them easily, you're never more than 10 seconds away from trying a new combination. Some may work for you but not your friend. Some may work better for The Last of Us but not Black Ops III. Experiment with different setups. Find YOUR style, then wreck face.   Note: The original rubber on my controllers had almost completely worn off before I applied these new grips. Anything that was left, I ripped off myself. I've read reviews stating that the KELUX grips come off if pushed too hard with the thumb. I myself have had no such issue. Not sure if this is due to the lack of the stock grip or if I just have weak thumbs :P   Enjoy your purchase. I know I am.	2015-08-16

I'm using it with a touch screen computer, so its function, combined with the touch pad and screen is to add a measure of flexibility.  I surfed around and you can't beat the price.

I started 4 years ago not ever having played any card games--I was such an amateur I had to carry around a cheat sheet to tell me &#34;what beats what.&#34;  That's why I bought MP.  I still use it daily because I continue to learn from it. The advice and rationale MP gives me has taught me how to play to win. I highly recommend this wonderful instructional tool.	2015-08-16
US	8978869	R2S3TWKS7J2XJD	B00007KQC1	281412787	Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter - PlayStation 2	Video Games	1	3	3	N	N	Worst RPG Ever Made	I love video games and I really like the BOF series, this trash is the exception. This game forces you to lose and start new games over & over & over again, each time while carrying stats over, in order to progress through the story. Aside from already being forced into constant new games, when you use one of your powerful special abilities in a fight, it kills you and your forced to start a new game..... think about that for a minute. This last part is minor compared to the other awful aspects, but the footstep sound effects are very annoying. This is literally the worst RPG I've ever played.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Literally none.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Everything!<br /><br />Play any of the other Breath of Fire games instead, especially BOF3 and BOF4. In addition, there are plenty of other amazing PS1 RPG's you can play instead of Dragon Quarter. My favorites are: Legend of Legaia, Legend of Mana, Suikoden 1 & 2, Grandia, Final Fantasy 7, 8, and FF Tactics, Wild Arms, Star Ocean, Guardian's Crusade, Legend of Dragoon, etc.	2015-08-16

Maybe that was a mistake because I've had it for less than a week and I'm already bored with it. The game is very repetitive, and there is very little to do most of the time. You solve the same Mii problems, read the same dialogue, and play the same games everyday. There are daily events, but the events are the same everyday so even those lose their appeal after the first couple of days. While you do have some influence over your Miis, You can tell your Miis what you think of their relationships if they ask, but you can't tell them to go be friends with someone or ask them out if they don't already plan on it in the first place. People compare the game to Animal Crossing or The Sims, but it's much more like watching fish in a tank, if your fish wore clothes and had really weird dreams.<br /><br />Despite my complaints, the game isn't terrible. There's a large amount of clothing, food, and room interiors to unlock, and different Miis will like different ones. The Miis themselves are able to be customized greatly as well. Aside from the regular Mii customization found on the 3DS, you are also able to give them a customized voice and one of 16 different personalities. All of this can be easily changed at any point in the game by just selecting the \\\"Edit Mii\\\\\" option at either the Town Hall or in their rooms. You are also able to dye their hair various other colors not found in the Mii Maker by using a hairspray item given to you by your Miis after helping them out. There are several different things you can give as gifts when your Mii levels up as well, which they will then use in their apartments. Sometimes Miis will use these with their friends when they hang out together. I'll look in a room and see a group of Miis playing with a cat using a rent-a-cat coupon, or they'll be playing the Wii U (if you listen closely you might be able to recognize the games they're playing), or I'll see four Miis standingaround in a circle having a maraca party. There are other areas you can unlock as well, like a park, a cafe, and an amusement park, that Miis may hang out at.<br /><br />Overall, I don't dislike the game, but once you see everything it loses it's appeal. It's a good game if you don't have a lot of time everyday and want something casual, as there is no consequence for not playing like there is in Animal Crossing, but I would recommend getting it at a cheaper price if you can. If you want a game that you can sit down and play for hours everyday, this isn't the game for you."	2015-08-16

Even without this the streaming service works well, with a decent selection of games (but it still needs more games before becoming a pay thing, which is ok since currently that is free.)  For android gaming its a big of an overkill because no games made for android can come close to using its power.  Don't have a 4k TV but plan on buying one this year.

First off, these headphones are decent for the price in terms of sound and features. I enjoy being able to adjust the bass and volume on the fly. They sound good enough and I find them comfortable. However, these headphones will simply not last. I endeavor to take as good of care as possible of my things to ensure that they last, but as you've probably read from other reviews, these will begin to crack along the thin plastic of the adjustable range of the earpiece, most likely within the first six months.<br /><br />I've had mine probably about two years now (consistently taped) and they have just finally broken completely through and duct tape is the ONLY thing keeping my right earpiece attached to the headset right now besides the internal wiring. It still works, but now it's much less comfortable and I'm seeking a new headset. If you're fine with buying a new set of these over and over then these may be for you. If you want something that will last for years with good care, search elsewhere. These Turtle Beaches are notorious for this poor construction quality with weak materials, built to break.<br /><br />For what it's worth, my friends also complained a lot about an electronic buzz noise that these produced when I was using the microphone until I just got a stand alone mic to supplement these.<br /><br />TLDR; They're alright headphones but they'll break even with care. Be warned.	2015-08-16

My son was very excited when I handed him this Turtle Beach headset for his PS4. Most teenagers don’t talk on cell phones anymore because they prefer to text. The only time they do seem to communicate verbally is when playing online video games. So, what better way to encourage them to converse than with this nifty headset! According to my son, the headphones have a very simple plug-and-play setup so there are no complicated instructions to follow. It fits nicely on his ears without too much pressure. It’s also easy to adjust. The clarity is quite impressive for the price point. It has convenient controls for the Mic Mute and Volume. Overall, he loves this headset.	2015-08-16

I ordered this knowing there was no other reviews, so I was not expecting much. This case was actually a bit better than the PSVita Game Traveler Case (PSV122) I got with my Vita for certain things.<br /><br />Compare:<br />They both hold the Vita rather well, I preferred the co2CREA version as it has better shock protection.<br />The PSV122 case holds 8 games and the Vita. co2CREA holds the Vita, 3 games ( Sorta, more on that below. ) and additional accessories such as the charger and headphones. Though if you have the single cartridge cases you can fit more games that way.<br />The PSV122 is slightly bulkier than some of the other cases.<br /><br />The Con(s):<br />Aside only holding 3 games, quality of the spacing between them was somewhat lacking as the spacing was strangely off. You may be able to fit games in them but getting them out is somewhat difficult if you do not have small fingers or nails. That is the only reason I could think of that would knock any stars off.<br /><br />Overall:<br />For $6.99 (At the time of purchase) vs $19.99 (Time of review) you get some and lose some. It is a fairly good starter case for those who want or need a case, but do not want to spend more than $10 on one. Would I recommend this case for those on a budget? Currently yes. Is there better? Yes there is, at a cost!	2015-08-16

Great Gaming	Video Games	4	2	2	N	Y	Nvidia Shield - Windows Media Center is dying - is this the successor?	I bought the Shield as a replacement for my Windows Media Center primarily to watch movies, TV and listen to music. Playing games is low on the list so I have not really assessed this part of the Shield's capabilities.<br /><br />As a media player this device is very accomplished for the range of formats it supports and the sheer speed of the device. I mostly use the Plex app which looks very nice and due to the Shield supporting many video codecs Plex can 'direct play' videos, negating the need to transcode on the fly. I also use Netflix in Ultra HD and this looks brilliant on my 70in UHD TV. I now prefer to watch TV shows available on Netflix in UHD compared to local free TV which in Australia rarely does Full HD, let alone UHD. One example is The Blacklist, watching this on Free Tv vs Netflix via the Shield in UHD is stunning in the difference. Whilst my Sony UHD TV has inbuilt UHD for Netflix, the Shield is simply faster and flawless in playback.<br /><br />UHD on YouTube is growing in the catalog and the voice search works very, very well. This is far more convenient than reaching for a keyboard, which is also supported.<br /><br />The device itself is virtually silent, looks great and the remote control (whilst costing extra) is a nice addition for media duties.<br /><br />Many have commented on the lack of Apps in the Android TV Play Store and whilst I agree, the basic apps are there, an exception for my type of use is TV DVR features, live TV works well in a few different apps using network tuners from Silicon Dust who I understand are working on DVR features for Plex as part of a Kick-starter program.<br /><br />The only feature holding me back from a full recommendation as a media player is the absence of audio bit streaming pass through. This has also been commented in other reviews and I see that Nvidia are planning this support in a future update. I keep checking for the updates everyday as once this bit streaming arrives it will have exceeded my Windows Media Center for day to day use and with the extra capability of flawless UHD, the Shield will be king of our lounge room.	2015-08-16

Could be better.	They're good. The only thing that would make them better is if they were thicker, concave, and shorter bumps. I feel like these will last for about a year max. Meanwhile I purchased these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045BCM38?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) before and they're amazing. Fit well, thick, add some girth to the thumb sticks but give you better control. These are sturdy enough to handle any game I play and I mostly play sports, shooters, and rpg games.	2015-08-16

Except on &#34;hard&#34; the animals drove me a bit nuts...eagles swooping down way too often, never giving up and flying away, and as they dive bomb you, the game stops you from doing anything as the eagle is pretty far away...that is to say, it's diving - you're aiming and at some point way to far from you...you have to wait to be attacked.  I've shot a lot of eagles, but they're just too plentiful.  Same goes for the Wolf - who is much easier to dispense with and more realistic, but when &#34;hunting&#34; some guys with fire arrows, the wild animals and the unflinching accuracy of the distant fighters was just annoying - NOT FUN - at least not to me.  HARD is not hard on many aspects of the game, while HARD is ridiculously specific on other aspects.  I picked it up on Xbox Live for a good price, it is kinda fun, but if I'd rented it I would have saw it's not different enough from FC3 to make the cut.  Oh well, maybe FC5.	2015-08-16

The microphone works well enough.  Also, we don't have to yell to get his attention since one ear is exposed.  If you plug the headset into your iPhone, everything works and you can make calls, hear what people are saying and people can hear you through the microphone.  Probably good for telemarketers and phone-support types, too.	2015-08-16

I was an xbox 360 owner that switched to playstation 4 because it was cheaper and all that stuff that happened when the newer consoles got announced. The game itself is a masterpiece, everything from the story to the music and the gameplay makes it for a great thrill. This is probably one of the best looking ps3 game out there, so 1080p at 60hz is very nice and smooth. There's also an option for 30fps instead of 60fps and a very easy to use photo mode. The story is very emotional although I didn't like how many times the characters said the f* word but I guess we're all used to it. The dialogue is very good, the gameplay is easy to get used to but difficult at times and the multiplayer is very stealthy. The soundtrack is just a pleasure to hear as the game goes on. Hopefully they get Gustavo Santaolalla back if the game gets a squel. If you just bought a ps4, or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about this game, I would highly recommend it.	2015-08-16

It has really helped with my game play which is something I was sceptical about beforehand. You can actually pinpoint directional events using the surround sound presets. Long periods wearing the headset are comfortable and actually forgot I had them on at times. What is also great is the fact I can mute my TV and play games late at night without disturbing the rest of the family.<br /><br />A few things that I think could be improved though, is the fact that your not quite sure which preset( surround sound) your actually using. Although this is a minor point it would be nice to have a reference point or indicator so you can ensure your using your favorite settings. Secondly it took a bit of figuring out how to hook up my Xbox using the optic cable, luckily I was able to plug straight into my TV, an option not everyone may have. Would love a rechargeable battery pack similar to a gaming controller<br /><br />Very happy with this product and would highly recommend this to future purchasers	2015-08-16

Simply amazing! This is one single cart holding two of the best early console RPGs of all time, remastered for the 16 bit SNES. At the prices you can find this for online, there really is no question that you should purchase this, providing you can read Japanese or have some way to patch it with your prefered language. These are, in my opinion, some of the best RPGs of all time. There is not job or class system here; this is just good old fashioned  monster killing at its best. If you enjoy this game, I would also highly recommend ordering the third game for the SNES as well, as all three fit into a single trilogy.<br />Beyond the third, if you are looking to further explore the series, I would simply hunt down copies of 4-6 for the Nintendo DS. 7-8 are reported to be coming to the 3DS by the end of 2016, and 9 was originally released for the Nintendo DS. 10, however, is only available in Japan, as it is an MMO, though a possible offline version of it could reach the west at some point, which has been rumored. Finally, 11 has been announced for PS4, and NX (Nintendo's unnamed next generation console), with a 3DS version that plays similarly to the classic games in the series also being released.	2015-08-16

I generally like small mice and this one was a little too large. I also did not like the LED which can be a serious bother at night when the lights are off.<br /><br />I also had to physically destroy the buttons on the side, because I would randomly press on them while browsing a web page and they would act as pressing the back button. This was extremely aggravating. I used the manufacturer's software to disable the side buttons, but they software sucks and would randomly stop working, so the only option was to physically remove the buttons, which I did soon after getting it.<br /><br />Now, after 8 months, I am looking for a new mouse because the left-click button has started acting erratically. Sometimes a click works, sometimes it doesn't. This can be incredibly distracting.<br /><br />The scroll worked fine at first. But currently it only works when doing a significant scroll. When trying to do an accurate scroll, sometimes scrolling down actually scrolls things up, and sometimes the page I'm on jumps up and down randomly.	2015-08-16

Shame on me if I'm missing something, if not,  shame on Microsoft for not providing a &#34;delete all saved files&#34; function. I've noticed other things about saving and deleting game-files on X-box 360 memory cards that seem harder and more inconvenient than they probably should be, but maybe I am ignorant of how to do these things.

At first, I thought the slow load times were a result of the device not being formatted, so I did that. Things worked just okay for a while, and I was willing to look past the long load times (because there is a lot more on this hard drive than my previous one), until things were at a standstill. In fact, games stopped loading altogether, and I lost some files I'm never going to get back on account of them becoming corrupt.<br /><br />I would appreciate it if these hard drives were tested a little more thoroughly before being made for sale. It could just be that this was a fluke, but it nonetheless severely ruined my week to lose all of that data.	2015-08-16

My hands sweat a lot when I'm playing video games. So much so that sometimes, there is sweat dripping down my hands. It's gross. but because of that I had to try this controller. The air flow definitely helps cool off my hands, but the one drawback is that the fan is fairly loud. It's not loud enough to prevent you from hearing your game, but if you're in an emotional scene, you're going to hear the sound of a fan and, in my opinion, it kind of ruins the feel. Other than that, this controller is great.	2015-08-16

I have to agree it's got horrible manufacturing.  We had ours about 6 months, and the banana plug snapped IN THE MIDDLE.  How can this happen?  I have no idea.  The headphone on this model is the same as the PX12, they just give you an equalizer.  Since the equalizer is such a PITA to lug around and because of all the wires on your desk, the PX12 is a much better buy, we never use the equalizer.  I wish I'd bought the PX12, then I wouldn't have lost so much money so quickly.<br /><br />We also have a Steel Series Siberia V2, which has much better bass, by the way (if you plug in the equalizer you can get this headset to have ALMOST as good a sound BUT NOT QUITE).  The problem with the Siberia is that it has sticky vinyl earcups where this one has cloth which is marginally less sweaty.  Anyway, the build quality of the PX22 is total crap, my son is 13 years old and it broken within 100h of use, making it the most expensive headset that I have ever owned.  RUN AWAY!	2015-08-16

The Kinect picks up my 4 year old and lets her play the game easily.<br /><br />What I can't fully express in a review is my unbridled joy that was on my kid's face as she played this game.

Functions well, looks great, and is much less expensive than the Sony brand controller.  A couple of things to keep in mind: this does not have a charging cord -- instead, it requires batteries.  Also, it will need to be synched with its USB receiver -- you do this by plugging in the receiver, turning on the game system, and holding the &#34;home&#34; button on the controller down until the red lights on the receiver and the controller stop blinking.  This can take a good ten seconds, and you'll have to do this every time you turn on your game console.  Because I will have to buy batteries for this periodically, it remains to be seen whether this is, in fact, a less expensive option than Sony's rechargeable controller when all is said and done.  I do, however, as previously stated, LOVE how it looks.  :)	2015-08-16

This game is deeply flawed, but this one aspect was enough to turn it around into an enjoyable experience for me.<br /><br />The other good thing I can say about it is that, while grinding is required, it isn't nearly that much. If you've ever grinded in a game and not minded that much then you'll probably be okay with its use here.<br /><br />Probably the most disappointment part of this game to me, is the way it discourages exploration. You keep teleporting back to your school at the end of every mission, so you keep seeing the same places. You do get your airship to fly you around to other regions (don't get too excited it's just a cutscene then teleport) but without traveling on the tedious overworld map for far too long you still can't get much of anywhere. And trust me the overworld map is tedious.<br /><br />You walk slow, and the random encounters there are as generic as they come. The chobo's mitigate this issue, but since you have a limited number of them and the last for a limited time, you still won't want to explore. Especially since there are level 99 enemies running around the world map. If they catch you you're screwed. They are fairly easy to avoid but to someone who hasn't seen them before newly exploring and area and getting destroyed for it it feels like an &#34;F you&#34; from the developers.<br /><br />Also you have entirely too much downtime between missions. I get they wanted something else to break up the action, but the missions are by far the best part, yet if you just jump straight to the next one you'll die. Oh and this game lacks polish in a number of small areas as well.	2015-08-16

By the end of this game you'll be asking yourself 3 things. One why would the actors/actresses agree to have their likenesses so poorly portrayed and animated? Two what even happened and what was the point of this poorly written story. Three how did Sega even consider this game a finished game? I gave this game 2 stars because I was able to play as Warmachine and that was cool even with the not-so-great flying mechanics.

A lot of these reviews are bad mostly because people are complaining that Best Buy has it for $300, but... I definitely spent a lot of time looking for the best price down to the dollar, and I don't think people realize that when you add tax, that purchase will be $321. This comes out to just under $319. So it's actually a tiny bit cheaper, and with prime it gets to you super quick and easy with package tracking included.<br /><br />This is amazing because it's the black DELUXE bundle, so it's 32GB, and comes with all of the nice stands for the console and gamepad (even one that charges the gamepad), sensor bar for Wiimotes, etc. And Splatoon is included, which is what makes this the Special Edition; there's no new design or anything, if that's what you're looking for, it's the standard Black Deluxe. However! the great thing about this is if you are already wanting to purchase Splatoon it's absolutely a wonderful deal - it's saving you a whole $60 of buying the game, and even with the slow connection where I was staying, it downloaded very quickly. Just be careful not to lose the special little paper with the code!<br /><br />And if you are on the fence about spending your money on the WiiU... honestly, it's worth it. I wanted it since it was released so I waited forever to save up the money, and when I had it I felt like I was holding blacks of gold. The use of the gamepad is innovative and so much fun, and the motion controls on it work like a dream. It communicates directly with the WiiU so you don't have to worry about juggling the sensor bar. And the graphics!!! Using an HDMI cable, it's all 1080p, and it is absolutely pristine and beautiful, I was completely in awe. (If you don't have that connection you do have the option of using other AV cables, but they don't come included (the HDMI cables do of course) so if you want to start playing right away without the HDMI then you'll need those beforehand.) Miiverse is a super cute little community and it's cool tosee what other players all around the world are saying! There's so many games out for it right now, so you have plenty to play, and you also have the option of moving all your Wii data to the new system - of course it's backwards compatible with the Wii games, but not gamecube I don't think.<br /><br />Now if it's the game you're on the fence about: Splatoon is a game I have been dying to play. it's not a typical action shooter at all - it's incredibly fun and varied and interesting, and I find it can be either intense and exciting or very chill and calming depending on your mindset while playing. The whole game really focuses on positivity, so it's wonderful for all ages. there's a whole lot of buttons but after just a couple matches you'll see how quickly you get the hang of it. It's my favorite game hands down right now. I recommend looking at some gameplay videos on YT if you're unsure how you feel about it just by what you read! (And honestly, if you're buying a WiiU anyway, you should get this one since you're paying the same price as getting a regular one, but you have this game to try out and if you don't like it too much you're not losing anything.)<br /><br />All in all I was not disappointed by this amazing system, and I wholeheartedly give my vote right here for best price and service :)	2015-08-16

It allows you to look around the plane your flying just by looking with the movement of your head like you would if you were in a plane and wanted to look left, up, down, lean in for closer view, sit back for farther back view, you get the idea. There is a program you can run to get the aim and speed of movement just right. One thing I did find out though, is that it is sensitive to bright sources of light, the darker the room the better when you use it. If it picks up too much stray light, like from sun coming in window behind you, it can act eradic. I must say that it took me a little bit to get used to it, and I don't always use it, but don't think you can go wrong with it for the price.	2015-08-16

I bought this one on Groupon thinking I was getting some slamming deal, as I remember them being over $50 when they were first released, and I also needed a new headset to replace my old Logitech one (they do NOT make their products to last like they used to).<br /><br />So out of the box, they look great. Some people here hate the mesh on the phones themselves, but I think they're comfy. The part that's not comfy? The fact that you feel like you're wearing a vice on your head after you put them on. I'm going to echo the other reviewers on here when I say that these things are TIGHT. Tighter than any other headphones I've worn, and the only thing that's adjustable are the phones, not the headpiece they're connected to. So if your head is bigger than a 12 year old's, then these will not be comfortable. I couldn't return them, so I've been slowly stretching the plastic (to the point of hearing it crack) to get these to fit better. Because that's what I bought these for. To manhandle them into fitting.<br /><br />Also it only took about 20-30 minutes of wearing these before I started getting a headache. The other reviewers here aren't kidding or being sissies, this is a common problem because they're so tight.<br /><br />So next up, another huge problem I haven't seen addressed, is the 7.1 sound. Or not really the sound, as the sound quality is great - that's one of the only things this has going for it. No, it's the volume control device. This thing lets out an earth-shattering, you'll-feel-like-Carlos-in-Freddy's-Dead (look it up) BEEEEEEEEP!!!!!! noise that will only add to your discomfort of wearing these if you have to change the volume, or hit the mute button. Even if you're lowering the volume, the actual beep you'll hear in the headset is not going to change and will be as obnoxiously loud as ever. Why that had to be added is beyond me. With any other device, I can tell when I'm lowering or raising the volume because the sound will ACTUALLY get louder or quieter, and if it doesn't, then that's a good indicator something's wrong. I don't need that extra sound to help me.<br /><br />I haven't used the mic, but that thing looks super flimsy so I'm not touching it. I also don't usually talk to people on PSN because most people online annoy the crap out of me. Supposedly the mic goes to mute when you retract it back into the headset, which knowing my luck, I can see that being the first thing to break and then everybody could hear me regardless.<br /><br />So ultimately, for $20-$25, you can certainly do better than these. Look at more Amazon reviews and even plunk down some extra money and buy better phones. I read some excellent reviews of the HyperX Cloud II headphones, maybe start there, but they're also like $70 more. So maybe you get what you pay for. I don't know.	2015-08-16

I really enjoyed this game a lot. It was a stellar mix of action with an amazing movie tied in. The voice acting was top notch as were the graphics, and the pacing was excellent. Additionally, the level design worked well with this game, and some of the levels were just flat out awesome. Additionally, I loved the new IP created for this with the Knight of the Round Table in a steampunk late 1800's setting. I really have nothing bad to say about this game. To me, much like Ryse, this game was panned unfairly in my opinion. I dont think I would have been stoked to pay $60 for this game, but I purchased it for $20 and felt like I got well more than my money's worth out of it. I hope they continue with the series, as this was designed to be the first in what will probably be a trilogy if they continue with the IP.	2015-08-16

I honestly dont know why everyone is hyping this game. I will give you a honest review of my first time playing this game. The game is predictable with the story, honestly halfway the first game I got bored. The shooting mechanics is pretty bad. The story just jumps in without explaining much of Nate or Sully (this is part of the reason where the game gets a low score) you pretty much dont care for anyone in this game. The gameplay is just as about youd expect in a mediocre game. You jump around ledges and stuff then shooting galleries then more jumpinh then again more shooting. even the game makes fun of it in between of how repetitive it is. The first game is crap so thats worth like 5 bucks, 10 tops. Uncharted 2 well its slightly better as accuracy with guns and the melee is a bit intresting. Graphically Uncharted 2 has improved within the few years between 1 and 2. The story is even a little but more intresting but its the same jumping/shootinh crap this game is almost like a carbon copy of Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider its the best description I can put it. Get this game used for like 10 bucks or even 12. I have no idea how this game was even game of the year there is just nothing fascinating about it. Characters you dont care about, mediocre gameplay, boring story. You will reach a point where you will get bored of the game. Its just those games to play to kill time	2015-08-16

The story is awesome and the add ons are even better. This game keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time you play it.<br /><br />I am 27 hours into the game and I haven't even discovered half the locations and I only put a small dent in the quests.<br /><br />I would honestly rate this game a 9.7/10. Only problem with this game is the karma system is a little silly. If you kill a good person even if they attack you, you will lose karma. Say you kill an enemy that a &#34;good&#34; character didn't want you to kill. The &#34;good&#34; character will attack you and well, you have to defend yourself and kill the character but you will lose karma which is silly to me. Another thing is the graphics aren't the best but that is ok because the game was made in 2008 and the gameplay DEFINENTLY makes up for it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get this game. I like to call this game artwork because well it is artwork. This game is honestly a masterpiece and a lot of time and energy went into making it. Bethesda are known for making games with huge maps and rich stories and they really outdid themselves with this game! GET THIS GAME!	2015-08-16

Not a platform game, so with the more open format of walking around where ever in this Bikini Bottom world, doing whatever, hoping to find something interesting to do, it leads my son to get bored quick with this (or do the same thing over and over… which also gets him bored).

That's a pretty accurate description.<br /><br />In ways, it tops the Souls series.  The graphics and presentation are top notch and the story is actually coherent.<br /><br />But in all other ways it falls short of the Souls series' glory.  The single most frustrating aspect to me was that the maps are incredibly easy to get lost in.  The Souls games never provided any type of map for you to view but for the most part the pathways to and from places were pretty intuitive.  Not the case in LotF.  There is no variety in the locales, it's either crumbly castles or snowy peaks, and after a while it all starts to look the same.  This problem is compounded at the end of the game when you have to find 3 levers to access the final boss.  There is nothing that tells you that you need to find levers, no hint at where they are, and the levers themselves tend to blend into the wall textures.  Probably 1/3 of my logged time in the game was just going through the same corridors and hallways I'd been down 100 times just trying to figure out what to do or how to get back to an area I'd already been.<br /><br />I found most of the equipment in the game to be useless.  There are a handful of weapons in the game that stand head and shoulders above the others, rendering all of the others utterly useless.  Sadly there is no option to sell or dismantle weapons, so they just sit in your inventory taking up space.  You'll find a treasure chest and crack it open with excitement only to see that it's a weapon worse than what you already have, and with no way to sell it, it's a paper weight.<br /><br />You can invest XP in either improving attributes like strength, agility, vitality, etc. or you can invest them in learning & improving spells.  The spells are incredibly useful and almost seem to undermine physical combat.  You can learn only 4 spells however, and once you've maxed them out, there is no use in investing XP in magic anymore.  This became frustrating when I found a spell point shard that I couldn't even use because my spells were already maxed out.  Add that shard to the other useless items in my inventory.<br /><br />There were times when actions seemed unresponsive, which became frustrating when trying to evade a boss' attacks.  Not sure WHY my character wouldn't roll when I clearly pressed the X button.  It wasn't an extremely frequent problem but in a game where every dodge and attack can be the difference in winning or dying, yeah, it's pretty frustrating.  (And I don't think it's my controller because I've never had unresponsive buttons before).<br /><br />Camera angles become problematic in cramped corridors.  Not only does it make locking onto an enemy hard, especially if they're very near you, but often times the enemy's health bar would float just above the screen making it impossible to tell if your attacks were effective or if the enemy was one more swing away from dying.<br /><br />All is not bad in the game though.  It does still provide some satisfying Souls style combat, but it lacks Souls'.... well... soul.  I got the game for $24.00 and I'm glad I didn't pay more.  It's probably worth $15-20 depending on your thirst for this type of game..

I love the storyline and the fact that you can skip through different parts of each saga so that it doesn't become boring and monotonous. I also love that you're given characters like SSJ3 Goku and Super Buu (Gohan absorbed) from the beginning. The mini games are also a lot of fun. It's a nice break from the normal storyline. If you're used to the old Playstation 2 games like I am, then it'll take a little while to get used to the controls, but just look over the guide and do some training and it'll come easy. The Graphics are awesome. Occasionally, you'll be backed against a wall and your camera will lose focus, but that is just a minor inconvenience. Finding Dragon Balls isn't the same as the DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi games-- they aren't found by luck or chance, but by completing one of the mini challenges and then fighting and beating a random CPU character in a Dragon Ball Battle. Overall, great graphics, good music, fun gameplay.. it's a great game and I highly recommend it.	2015-08-16

But if you've played through Fable and Fable 2, and you're expecting something similar, you'll be disappointed.  They changed just enough to tick me off.  For starters, there's a lot more story, which is fine if you want to watch a movie, but I was hoping to play a game.  The process by which you go about buying items is cumbersome and limited, as you actually look at items on pedestals in shops, which leaves you with about 4 options (or even one) from each vendor.  So, rather than sorting through a nice list of 30 weapons from a particular weapon trader, you go into a shop and look at 2-4.  And the best weapons are the ones you start with anyway, as they change as your skills increase.  Navigating the options menu isn't a menu at all, but a &#34;room&#34; called the &#34;sanctuary&#34;, where you walk into a door to see your wardrobe options, another door to see your weapons, etc.  It's creative and bold, and I suppose I'm glad someone tried it, but it's no fun.  Fable 2 was probably the best game I've played in a very long time.  Fable 3 was a huge disappointment.  Also, it's short.  I played through the whole main story in about 8 hours.  And, once you've finished the main story, your other options are limited based on the way the game ended, which, as you know, will vary depending on your choices.  So, I played through it a second time.  I made different choices.  It wasn't much more fun.  Bah.  You can decide.	2015-08-16

If you have Cauliflower ear like myself and wear glasses This will be a headset that will hurt like no tomorrow. The product has a tight grip on your head so it doesn't move which is where the pain kicks in from. If it wasn't for that I wouldn't have an issue. I have tried having it sit on objects open so that it could &#34;bend into&#34; the shape for a week and a half, but it didn't change at all.

Well guess what all the old stuff is there, gadgets are almost exactly the same as they've ever been.  So a lot of the combat parts have a familiar and I dare say worn feeling.  But if it was just more of that I think I would have liked it more.  Instead they add the batmobile and you've heard by now it is used to death and it generally NOT fun.  Have fun being outnumbered 40 to 1 by enemy drones and then have fun doing it over and over again.  Add to that more tedious than ever side missions and riddler quests and I just can barely finish this.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviews I actually enjoyed the story and it is the only thing keeping me going.  I am on the last story mission as I write this and I can't wait to finish it and be done.  Won't be going back for any side quests and sure as hell won't be getting any DLC.<br /><br />I also question if I will be buying any more of these games, the combat is fun enough in concept but wow - this series could use a power reboot ie start from the ground up with the gadgets and please go back to a focus on solving crimes/missions!  NO - freeing 25 towers/ blowing up mines that make hundreds of drones come, etc are NOT fun I cannot believe anyone actually has \\\"fun\\\\\" doing that crap.  Compare this to the early games like Arkham City and the Deadshot missions and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />So in conclusion this has a decent story and I did enjoy the partnering up parts of the game so maybe get it on sale if you have to but just know it gets real tedious real fast."	2015-08-16

I have constant messages telling me Destiny is contacting their servers, then the game crashes. Two out of three times I try to go to the tower, my game crashes. When I try to play in the crucible, the game lags, if I am lucky I play a little bit, then the game crashes.  Stupid error codes like &#34;weasal&#34; and &#34;baboon&#34;. I have a great internet connection. I can play CoD and Battlefront.   Other things are: Everything is SLOW. Not counting the lag, expect to wait several minutes to go to travel anywhere.  I don't have 6 friends to play online with so I am unable to complete the best content in the game. There is no match-making for raids.  PVP seems broken to me. It says it is level matched, but people do things I can't do, and seem to have way better weapons. If they wanted it to be fair, it would be more like CoD. Let you have separate classes that you choose from to play with, with everyone using their choice from a list of the same guns and skills	2015-08-16

The left analog stick started going bad recently and was affecting my Call of Duty gameplay. I noticed whenever I pressed down to run, I would run for about a second then start walking. I'd have to pressed down again to start running again only to stop after another 1-2 seconds. This kind of spastic running/walking was irritating me to the point where I could not really play that well.<br /><br />Through the controller out and bought another one. Works like a charm.

There's NO getting around that fact, but that large price tag is MUCH easier to swallow when the product performs as well as these do.  I am the proud owner of a high end 7.1 Klipsch home theater, but unfortunately as a town-home owner that is attached to 2 neighboring houses, I don't get the opportunity to crank the sound to necessary &#34;action&#34; volumes. Sound is such a HUGE part of the immersion experience for both movies and video games, that I felt like I was missing out on the intended experience.<br /><br />Enter the Turtle Beach Ear Force Elite 800x Headset.... these things are AWESOME.  I was slightly concerned that setting up the headset would be difficult with my current audio setup, but it was literally plugging in 3 cables; 1) USB from the included transmitter to the XBOX One, 2) Optical cable from the XBOX to the transmitter, and 3) Optical cable from the transmitter to my amplifier..... that's it.  The setup couldn't have been easier and the results are sheer audio pleasure.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you update the firmware on the included transmitter to fully open up customizable audio options for your headset.  This can easily be done by visiting the Turtle Beach website and following the step-by-step instructions.<br /><br />The audio quality is tight and distortion free even at the higher volumes and comes with various presets depending on what type of movie or game you are using them for. All of these presets can be adjusted on the fly using either the touch sensitive buttons on both of the ear cups, or by using your phone or tablet with the Elite Audio Turtle Beach app.  Personally I prefer the app as it is MUCH easier and slightly more intuitive to use.<br /><br />The ear cups are comfortable for long gaming sessions, but the headset is slightly on the heavy side and can result in a pressure point on the top of your head, but I only really have an issue with this during marathon sessions of 6 hoursor more.  Charge time for the internal battery is quick, and lasts longer than expected.<br /><br />Overall, the best thing that I can say about this headset is that it has replaced my Klipsch home theater setup for the majority of my gaming and solo movie watching needs.  I am FINALLY able to get that fully immersive experience, and it has made my digital media consumption THAT much more enjoyable.  In my eyes, the price is ABSOLUTELY worth the money if you use movies, TV shows or video games to unwind after an exhausting or stressful day.  Treat yourself and get that movie theater experience without ever leaving the comfort of your own home.	2015-08-16

This is my second Ear Force X12 Gaming Headset in just a 2 year period. I spent 50+ U.S dollars for each one and each one broke on me in the &#34;same way&#34;. The part of the headset where the earphone and the upper part that rests on your head connects always breaks because the company that makes them only connects them with plastic that can very easily crack and break leaving wire exposed. Twice I have had to put duck tape on mine which is useless because after putting the tape on the cracked side (which for me is always on the right earphone but I suspect the left side can crack as well) it no longer fits snugly over your right ear. It is basically ruined. When I first bought the first one I thought I was the reason why it broke even though I am very careful handling my property but after buying the second one and seeing that it broke in &#34;the very same place/way&#34; the first one broke I realized this headset is faulty-made. 100$ is a lot of money to be buying for one headset let along 2. Then I find out that a friend of mine has the same headset and his broke in the very same way and he, TOO, ended up having to put duck tape on his. Then we figured that if it breaks in this same way with us who else out there is experiencing the same thing. I mean is it really THAT HARD to use steel instead of plastic? How cheap can a company be. I will never, EVER purchase this particular headset again. Shame too because other than this serious issue this is a really good piece of gaming equipment. smh	2015-08-16

Potentially playing my retro games via HDMI sold me.....so I took a chance. I updated the system firmware to the current version available (August 2015).  Basically, the longer I used this system the more issues I uncovered.  Both the SNES and NES pin connectors were damaged within two or three days of use (not an exaggeration).  Bionic Commando for NES would not load at all and Rocket Knight Adventures for Genesis froze everytime once reaching the same checkpoint.  Both Bionic Commando and Rocket Knight Adventures cartridges have been used on their respective original systems without issue.  The system would also not recognize SNES controllers, which are also confirmed to operate correctly on my SNES and also on my friends Retron 3.  Within four days of purchasing the Reron 5, I made the decision to return the unit for a full refund.  While I expect others will have different experiences with this product, considering the issues I experienced (especially the pin connector damage within two-three days), the longevity of the unit is in serious question.  For the $139.00 I paid for the system, I cant see the Retron 5 withstanding years of use.  I will not discuss the copyright and legal concerns that are likely to plague Hyperkin associated with this product, as others have brought this up, but this also raises questions about whether Hyperkin will have the ability to provide updates to the firmware in the long term.  Save your self the trouble and don't repeat my mistake.	2015-08-16

Me and one of my best friend play this game a lot.  I do not own it, but might get it for WII.  We have not played the multiplayer or done any of the the campaign.  We only do special ops.  And on that, we only do survival and missions mode.  In missions, it's like a mini two player campaign with different things to do.  My friend hates single player campaign, but with this game and Black Ops lll, we will do that campaign.  With this game, there's nothing better than both of us killing the Tangos that have the presidents daughter and I make an impossibal kill right between the guy holding her and the daughter with bot of us yelling &#34;YYYYEEEEESSSSS!&#34;  That is what happens a lot in missions mode.  Same thing on the mission where we kidnap a president and we enter bullite time.  In survival, when ever we get to a certain wave, we both buy and call out Delta Squad and Riot Squad.  Riot Squad has blast shields and are VEEERRY effective.  Delta Squad is ok, but they have weird names, like Taco and Rooster.  What?!?  Delta Squad also dies very fast.  One thing we both hate is that neither squad has been med-kits, meaning they CAN NOT reviev you.  Another thing is that if one player dies all the way, mission over.	2015-08-16

The Vita version is currently the *only* physical release of the game. (Why Ubisoft choose the Vita of all platforms is a mystery.) So, if you are looking for a physical version then this is your only choice. That said, this is just as beautiful a game on the Vita as on any other platform. In fact, this is without doubt one of the best games on the Vita. Although the game has some problems, which is why I did not give it a five-star rating, I nevertheless highly recommend playing this game. Overall, I would rate it at 4.25 out of 5 stars. Let me explain why:<br /><br />GRAPHICS<br />=========<br />First thing you will notice about the game is that it is downright gorgeous. The game looks like a living watercolor painting, which is exactly what the producers were aiming for. If the graphics seem similar to some Japanese games, then again, that is also what they producers were aiming for. Although this was produced in Montreal, it is inspired by Japanese role-playing games (such as Odin Sphere). Regardless, the graphics are spectacular.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />======<br />Next thing you will notice is the music. The music is by Cœur de pirate (B&eacute;atrice Martin) and it is perfect (well, almost)! The music is very piano-centered. It is dreamy, surreal and slightly sad. The exception are some of the boss battle musics which sound like they were taken right out of a Japanese RPG (think Final Fantasy). The boss battle music is beautiful, but personally I feel it is out of place in the game. While the rest of the music makes you feel like you're in a fantasy dreamland, the boss battles make you feel like you're playing most any Japanese RPG. That said, I still love the soundtrack! It really does fit the fairy tale like atmosphere of the game. OK, now for the story...<br /><br />STORY<br />======<br />It's a beautiful story. It really is a fairy tale brought to life. Like most fairy tales the story is fairly simple and generic. You have monsters, a princess, sickness, good and evil. Don't expect the game to change your view on life. However, that said, much like fairy tales the game is a reflection/meditation about life, death, and purpose. It's simple enough that a young child can enjoy, and deep enough for an older individual (such as myself). Now... how fun is the game? Let's talk about gameplay.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br />=========<br />When I first played the game, I expected the game to be an action-RPG based on screenshots I saw. I was surprised to learn that it's turn-based. You &#34;bump&#34; into a monster and you start a battle. It has a real-time bar and you can see when your characters will act and when the monsters will act. If you time things properly, you can stop the monsters from attacking and in essence attack until they are defeated (well, that's the goal). Sometimes you will succeed, sometimes you will fail. If one of your part members falls, no big deal. You can replace him/her with another party member who will join the fight at full health. Sounds like the battles are easy? For the most part they are. They're also fairly repetitive. While certainly not bad, they do get old, which is one reason why I simply can not give this game 5 stars. You will do a lot of fighting. Some of the boss battles are beautiful and quite enjoyable, but for the most part you'll simply be grinding past enemies. Apart from battles what else is there?<br /><br />Side-Quests: The game does have side-quests, and for the most part they are very simple. Defeat these bad guys. Go back to where you were previously and find this or that. Not particularly exciting. That said, it's nice that they added these to the game. Unfortunately, you may find that you spend more time looking for said object simply because you know it's somewhere in the forest, but where? There are NO maps in the game! For the most part it's not a big deal, but it would have beenhelpful to have a map with highlights on it. Another complaint, the voice-acting or lack thereof.<br /><br />Voice-Acting: This game is told in a lyrical style. Everything that is said by any character basically rhymes. It would have been beautiful to hear professional voice actors speak the lines! While not all games have to have voice acting, I think for Child of Light it would really add to the dreamlike fairy tale quality. Besides, it's not hard to add an option to turn voice acting off if one so wanted. However, as it stands, there is almost no voice acting. Remember, this is not a small indie game, it was produced by Ubisoft so it's not as if it was beyond their budget!<br /><br />Linear Game: There are basically almost no choices in the game. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, there is very little character development. There certainly is some, especially for the heroine, Aurora. However, for the most part you just listen to what people have to say and that's about it. I wish there were a few more choices and we would get to learn more about the characters.<br /><br />Crafting: Child of Light has no weapons, no armor, and in fact you can not purchase anything! However, you can find lots of &#34;Oculi&#34; which are basically jewels that you can strengthen and combine to form more powerful jewels that can be equipped to give you certain bonuses. For example, a crude diamond can give the equipped character 5% extra experience. However, a diamond that has been crafted from stronger components will give 10% extra experience, and so on. It's cute. Unfortunately, there is no guide to crafting, and nothing in the manual. Which is to say, no manual. Which leads me to discuss, what exactly are you getting here that you're not getting elsewhere?<br /><br />VITA Features<br />===========<br />Apart from the fact that you are getting a physical version of the game, you are NOT getting anything new. Thus, if you already have a downloaded version of the game, you will find nothing new here. No exclusive characters. No exclusive locations. No bonus anything. In fact, not even a flimsy manual (cheap of you, Ubisoft, cheap). Well, I suppose in this day and age we should be thankful we have a physical copy so that we can loan it to friends or gift it. Still... would it really  hurt to add something exclusive, maybe just a map or manual?<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />============<br />Yes, I do have some complaints as noted above. That said, this is still a game that is worth supporting (tell Ubisoft we want more such games) and certainly worth playing (simple, yet engaging and beautiful game). Perhaps there shall be a sequel, and perhaps some of my complaints will be answered. I do hope there is a sequel, because this really is a wonderful game and it's refreshing to play something that not only has a strong female lead (you go, Aurora!) but is charming.<br /><br />+++Beautiful Graphics<br />+++Beautiful Music (I'm listening to it as I write this review :)<br />+++Simple, yet enjoyable story with a strong heroine.<br />+++Some side-quests, crafting, lots of treasure to find (well, basically potions and jewels).<br />+++The only physical version of the game available!<br /><br />-Overall battles are *very* easy, and repetitive.<br />-Linear game, little character development (apart from Aurora).<br />-NO new material in this physical edition.

I built a rogue with dodge and parry and tried to treat this as an action rpg. It kinda worked for a little bit, but I can't get through the game like this. It's become stale and boring, presumably because I haven't cranked up the difficulty and used tactical mode. My trouble is that doing so yields a game where it can take a while to come up with a good plan of attack, and I don't want to spend several minutes per encounter.<br /><br />It did have some great story moments though.	2015-08-16

While the Mass Effect series is absolutely amazing, this trilogy package is downright AWFUL. Despite buying the discs for the PC, you're forced to use the Origin client. I have had nothing but problems getting my games to work. I don't know how many times I've had to research and fix ME1. Origin and EA customer service is awful. The representative didn't address my concerns/problems, they just asked me to go through a mundane checklist that had nothing to do with my game crashing. The only other solution is to go to their forums dedicated to other players trying to fix the problems. Yeah, it's so bad they want their customers to deal with it amongst themselves. Unfortunately, it's a hit or miss with people genuinely trying to help each other. I don't know how, but I got through ME1 (again, after over a handful of issues) and was at least was able to start ME2 before that game crashed on me too. I'm currently trying to figure out why it won't even open as I write this. My advice, buy the trilogy on PS3 or Xbox or get the original PC games that don't require Origin to play.	2015-08-16

You story line is great, you care about almost all the characters, character development is fantastic, and the gameplay itself is pretty good(ME1= so-so, ME2=Golden, ME3=Good in my opinion).The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because ME3's ending a bit lackluster in the sense that it just barley ties things up and leaves you wanting much more, even with the dlc.	2015-08-16

We use our PS4 quite often for gaming, Netflix, Hulu, etc. It is on a good majority of the time in our household. Although, we haven't had any issues so far with the PS4 over heating we didn't exactly want to take that risk. The fan is small and easy to use and works quite well. We have had it on our PS4 for a couple of days so far and have noticed that it has been running really well and the temperature has been kept down nicely. We have been using the auto setting so it turns on as the temperature rises and I have to say it has been doing a good job of tracking that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who uses their system as much as we do!	2015-08-16

The game is relatively easy if you put in the time to grind, and the grind is pretty easy in this game compared to your typical JPN RPG. When I defeated Diablo, I was at Level 47, and that's with me exploring every map and killing every monster leading up to Diablo. Just started reaper of souls couple nights ago, can't wait to see what my character will be like when I get to Level 70.	2015-08-16

You can use any Video Game Enhancer to cheat games but no pirated software playing at all or playing movies that is burnt on blank media, this will get you caught and a letter will be sent to the individual who is circumventing all video gaming console systems security protections, also all video gaming enhancer's can be used in a legal manner to dump your bios files that comes straight out of your consoles hardware, no matter who manufacture that designs there Video gaming console systems, thank you!!!!

Believe me when I say this but I don't review things that often and when I do it, must be absolutely bad or absolutely good. And by now you can tell which it was by the star rating! This case was exactly what I was looking for in a 3DS XL case. It is slim and looks great. The case feels very sturdy in hand and you can tell it will protect your console within. There are a total of eight game holders, more than other brands which have less like the Hori case. On top of that the holders are a see--through mesh where you can tell what game is in the holder without taking it out and this is a huge plus for me. The console slot holds my New 3DS XL with a Hori case very snugly, exactly how I like it since it keeps the console from jostling around in the case and holds it all around unlike the other cases which have only some rubber band straps to keep it in place. The cost of the case being slim means that you cannot carry the stock brick charger, but I use a USB charger anyways which fits nicely in the top compartment without any bulge in the case. Outside the case, TakeCase sent me three emails, telling me they got my order, that it is shipped, and finally confirming that I got my case. To me this is great customer service and means that they care a lot about the customer. It actually made me want to make a review because of it. Overall, if you have a 3DS XL and are looking for a carry-all case (games, console, usb/earbuds) I would wholeheartedly recommend this case.	2015-08-16

Combat is pretty boring- basically just spam attacks, be ready press the block button, and dodge/stop gun shots. Combat also seemed kind of clunky/slow compared to other AC games. French storyline is okay, but I hate how they didnt take the user outside the Animus in this one. It was like a teaser by having more and more control over Desmond across the original series and then killing him off only to be replaced by a random Animus user. Now your &#34;character&#34; is just some other Animus beta tester who is supposed to relive the adventures of random assassins not at all related to him. They've either thrown out the idea of a character like Desmond who can relive his own ancestors' past lives and then become an assassin himself in the game's real world or they're saving their modern assassin for a much later game (which also sucks since that implies Ubisoft intends to milk the series for as long as possible and draw out the overarching plot for far too long before delivering a conclusion that fans want). To me, the game's redeeming qualities are its ability to allow a player to freely run around a well-constructed open world environment and the fun storyline of reliving the past in order to stop a present day evil organization. Bringing those god-like beings into the story and having them somehow interact with Desmond while he was reliving a memory was odd, but okay. But then they decide to kill off the guy you've been following the entire time and who they've hyped up as being some &#34;chosen one&#34;, too. Since the last pirate expansion, they've slowed the game's modern day plot to a standstill with all the games basically being &#34;oh look you're a beta tester and the templar organization is releasing a random new assassin memory so you should go live it. Maybe you'll see something that these templars didn't somehow already find prior to releasing it that can lead us on a hunt for a golden apple thing. Don't worry withthe real world hunt and evil organization, though. Just spend the whole time in the Animus and when you're all done we'll give you a pat on the back and move on to asking some other random person for help&#34;.

By the time I bought this, though, Ubisoft patched all the really troubling bugs (which would have really pissed me off if I got this at full retail on release day) so at least I got it for cheap.	2015-08-16
