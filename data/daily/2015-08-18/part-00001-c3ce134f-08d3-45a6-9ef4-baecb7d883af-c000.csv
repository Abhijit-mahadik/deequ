There are no &#34;stops&#34; or other indicators of sound level on the mic and receiver from other mics.  when I upgrade to XBOX One, I will upgrade to a different product instead of using the free adaptor that comes with this one.  So, an update - on August 30, 2015 - 13 days after the drop dead date for returns - the headset has a short in it that continually interrupts the hearing in one speaker (Left).  The short is in the wire as it runs into the melee control box from the headset.  I am the only user and I treat it gently.  Still, it is broken.  Lesson learned.  Polk products, in my view, suck.	2015-08-18

The Pro's:  EASY Setup with your xBox1, comfortable fit, mic monitoring (so you hear yourself), Mute, independent volume for game and chat volumes, 4 presets to somewhat change sound profile, quick-charging, long-lasting Li-Ion battery, NOT as Expensive as 800X, COMPLETELY WIRELESS GAMING (again, and finally) without an adapter.  The Con's: sound presets aren't appreciably different, not surround-sound-grade like previous XP500 headset, but also $50 cheaper.  Overall review, good headset for long gaming sessions where sound isolation, comfort, and WIRELESS connectivity are desired.  Setup took less than 3 minutes, worked without intervention and others said my voice was clear and normal sounding, even better than my Polk Audio 4Shot.  I think if you're looking for a headset that is completely wireless and has good sound and are willing to lay out $150, this is the best investment going.  Does it sound like the Stealth 800X?  No.  Does it cost $300?  No.  Is it wireless and sound good?  Yes.  Not audiophile good, but pretty impressive.  You'll hear all the little things you've been missing and you'll enjoy the soundscape. Also connects to phones/portables/tablets and it sounds fine.  Will they last?  Time will tell.	2015-08-18

The buttons(when Pressed) get stuck in that position, or slowly come back up from the adhesive. Constantly having the PS3 menu pop up randomly, cannot play games like this.

Don't register direction consistently, cheap hard to press, get what you pay for.	- Clean looking, new, packaged well<br />- Good shipping time<br />- Borderline unusable. Have to push joystick in the desired direction so hard to get it to register you feel like you might break it (haven't yet, which is possibly a testament to its strength). Mrs. Pack Man, Tennis, Asteroids are HARD to play... Button has a crisp center spot, but unless you are VERY intentionally hitting the center it's also hard to use.<br />- EXTERNAL build quality seems fine, but the button and joystick sensitivity are so low (and thus seem so cheap) that most games are just frustrating to play.<br />- One of 2 joysticks purchased does not consistently send movement signals. For example, while playing Tennis your character will stutter occasionally. If offered a refund I'd take it, but will likely not try to get them replaced. Will probably throw them away once I get something better.	2015-08-18

The hand grip holds the V2000 perfectly.

The grips themselves are a little large for my hands but make the vita significantly easier to use for extended periods. It also makes some games easier to play (Borderlands 2 etc).<br /><br />There is a space for the charging port at the bottom, and a space for your headphones to plug in too.

For reference, I am a long-time fan of the Sims, since the original (I feel the need to mention this since so many negative reviews like to start off by saying they're hardcore fans and if you're &#34;like them&#34; that you should skip this title...). If I had to rank the series, I would rank it as: Sims 4 &#62;  Sims 3 &#62; &#62; Sims &#62; &#62;  Sims 2.<br /><br />Pros (in no particular order)<br />-Art style/UI: Maxis has developed such a lovely and fitting style for the Sims 4. They're achieved a great balance between bright, colorful, fun, mature, simple and nuanced. The sims look good (and unique from one another without needing to have an extreme facial feature..), the world is gorgeous and everything has a nice streamlined look to it. The animations are on point and very well done.<br /><br />-Create a sim: There is so much more customizability for how your sim-bodies and sim-faces look now than ever before. This was a pretty big issue for me in the Sims 3, everyone looked way too similar unless they had some exceptionally strange feature.The hair, the clothes, the accessories and the like have a nice variety, are all really good looking and will actually be used unlike previous base games. Little things like boots fitting to the pair of pants you’re wearing and hats being wearable on every hairstyle are also fantastic upgrades. Making multiple outfits for a given category (i.e. everyday) means the sim will automatically rotate through the outfits by themselves. All of the clothing is maternity enabled.<br /><br />-Building: Building is much easier to do now and quite effortless to adjust as needed during your building. Things like the ability to make objects larger, taller walls, roofing, move stuff freely on the wall, etc. are all great. Not to mention all the bonuses that you get with the new move objects cheat such as moving objects up and down. There are also really great search and filter functions. The filter is nowhere near as slow as the sims 3.<br /><br />-Skills: There are 20 adult skills in total in the base game: Charisma, Comedy, Cooking, Gourmet cooking, fishing, fitness, gardening, guitar, handiness, woodworking, logic, mischief, mixology, painting, piano, programming, rocket science, video gaming, violin, writing. Compare this to 6, 7 and 10 found in Sims, Sims 2 and Sims 3 base games respectively. Needless to say, there is quite a lot to do and explore! Not to mention, there’s quite a lot of collecting to do, too – rocks, gems, fossils, crystals, etc.<br /><br />-The town is alive. I have played through many generations in several saves, and the town remains fully alive, with lots of sims of varying ages all around. Just walking down the sidewalk/paths around your house, doing things when you visit public lots, etc.. there are lots of sims to interact with! They age and die, but there is an automatic repopulating that happens (new families are created and allowed to move in or just be townies automatically). Story progression (even how flawed it was) is an amazing feature of the Sims 3, but it was quite a common occurrence for public places to just be.. barren in the Sims 3.. not so in the Sims 4.<br /><br />-Flushed out life children. Children are no longer as useless as they were in previous games (unless you had the expansion packs to give them more character and such). Children are well developed with a healthy amount of content for them to do.. which is fantastic. I’d rather have well developed children than mediocre-children and mediocre-toddlers that we got in the Sims 3 base game (and even with expansions toddlers were still pretty meh to me – and I’m a family style player, for reference).<br /><br />-Aspirations/Lifetime Rewards: These have changed quite a bit from Sims 3. You are free to switch aspirations as you play (and I’d even recommend that so you can complete them both at the same time) without losing progress. They are broken down into 4 steps with various requirements to fulfill. Finishing a given aspiration will give your sim a new trait. There are a few aspirations exclusive to children and the traits you gain from that will carry on to adulthood.<br /><br />-Multitasking: Need I say more?<br /><br />-Emotions/whims: Another significant change from Sims 3, which was a significant change from the sims 2. Wishes are now replaced by whims – 3 of which exist at once – one that is emotion based, and two that are not. You can pin the two that are not emotion based to prevent them from disappearing. Emotions are quite fun to play with, and being in a particular mood will give benefits to certain sorts of skill building or the like. The emotions are fine (neutral), happy, confident, energized, flirty, focused, inspired, playful, angry, bored, dazed, embarrassed, tense, uncomfortable and sad. The emotions add a lot of character and fun interactions to the sims, and make them seem so much more alive. I’m more connected to my sims than any previous game (though sims 3 is still close, sims and sims 2 are just blown out of the water). Relationships are more complex, and things are more unpredictable now.<br /><br />-Neighborhoods/Worlds: A very nice middle ground between being constricted to a single lot yet still being able to explore the world, albeit not Sims-3-style. There’s plenty of ground to cover and explore, yet not enough to cause too much instability in the game engine/code and make sure the game runs smoothly. A huge plus to the new world system is that you will not run out of space for expansion content. A new expansion? Well, there’s a new world that you can travel to and get all of the expansion content! No need to worry about deleting houses, placing awkward lots, or the like.<br /><br />Gameplay in general: Long story short, I just find myself enjoying the amount of content, the emotions and my sims so much more than in previous iterations of the game, which is quite impressive for a base game and will only beimproved upon with future expansions. Bottom line, the game is fun to play, it’s fun to explore. It’s fun to have specific goals (follow the career, aspirations, etc.) and it’s fun to just roll with the punches and let your sims do their own thing. This game is very different than the Sims 3, just as the Sims 3 is very different than the Sims 2 (and boy did it get a lot of hate for being so, though that’s kind of forgotten nowadays or people are just too young/too new to the series to know any better). I’m personally glad it is different, because I don’t wan’t “more of the same”, I want to see growth and progress in the series, and the Sims 4 has done a wonderful job at doing so.<br /><br />Cons (to some people at least)<br />-No Create-a-style. If the only reason you played the Sims 3 was for the CaSt feature, you'll be disappointed. However, the Sims 4 does have plenty of color choices to choose from, so it’s not that bad of a thing! (I actually prefer just having lots of presets so I don’t feel like I have to use CaSt to have things look nice).<br /><br />-No toddlers. I’m fine with this because toddlers got pretty boring in the Sims 3 after playing it so much. I do hope for a family-themed expansion that gives us *well developed* toddlers, though.<br /><br />-No open world. Still have neighborhoods, which is fine, but it is unfortunate having to load up a lot when you want to visit. Thankfully the loading screens are short and sweet.<br /><br />-Map display. It’s kind of lack luster. It gets the job done, but it’s nothing special.<br /><br />-No grocery stores. It’s not a big deal, but I wish you could just buy a variety of food and store it in the fridge. Instead, you have to pay for each meal as you make it.<br /><br />ADDED IN UPDATES: Pools (which can be built on any floor now), geneology (family tree), influence the gender of a baby via eating certain fruit/listening to certain music, half walls, door locking, an empty world (Newcrest), moveobjects, a couple careers, paid time off for work, family leave, ghosts, ability to &#34;paint from reference&#34; (family portraits, landscapes, etc), new eye colors and basements have all been patched in. To change a sims last name, go to a dresser, plan outfit, then click their name in the upper left corner and you should have the ability to change their name. It’s very easy for people to focus on the negatives, since that is what resonates most with us and that is what the internet is best at delivering. You don’t see people who are satisfied with games (not just the sims) flooding the forums or reviews with tons of positive feedback because they are playing the game and enjoying it. If you enjoy the Sims franchise, this is a solid release and well worth it, don’t let the negativity get to you! 	2015-08-18

After the dissapointment of Batman: Arkham Origins, people were excited for a new entry in the Arkham series by Rocksteady, the developers of the first two games, Asylum and City.  We finally have the game in our hands, is it good?  Yes, without a doubt.  Is it the last chapter the trilogy deserves?  No, it sadly isn't.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to get into the whole PC version debacle.  This is the PS4 version, the one I played and while I'm sure I'd have to knock several points down for performance issues, I never had to deal with those in particular.  Let's talk about the game proper.  First thing to notice is that this game ditches Origins' unnecessary Multiplayer option.  Good riddance, it was out of place and annoying, specially for trophy hunters.  Being the first game in the series to show up in the new generation of consoles, it looks fantastic, quite better than the previous ones, but there's obviously room for improvement (as an exercise, you can compare City with Asylum and you'll see how much better the former one looks compared to the latter, despite both belonging to the same gen).  The game boasts a larger map than the previous games and it's much more detailed.  The city has levels too in some parts, so it looks more realistic.  There are also no artificial or arbitrary limits in the middle like they were before.  You can easily glide in a straight line from any point on the map to its opposite without being stopped by a building you can't grapple to or glide over.<br /><br />And glide you will a lot.  It's still the most fun and versatile way of travelling throughout the map, despite the new addition of the Batmobile.  The developers seemed to have realized this, since they force the use of the batmobile on you A LOT. And here lies one of the major problems with the game.  The Batmobile is useful sometimes, and it can be fun as well, but there are just too many missions, side-quests, challenges and collectibles that require it, and it grows tedious because the Batmobile is just not as versatile as Batman.  You can do dozens of things as Batman, while only a handful of things with the car/tank, and forcing you the less fun part of the game for so much of it makes it turn tedious.<br /><br />Fortunately, Batman is at his most fun when controlling him.  Predator sections are still tons of fun, particularly with the new gadgets.  The combat is at its best here, with many more new kinds of enemies and abilities.  You have new fun takedown techniques that make use of the scenery, a new time-slowing ability or even other characters.  The fact that the combat is so fun makes it more annoying that so many of the combat sections are with the Batmobile, shooting drones.  There's a lot of variation in the Batman combat sections, but the Batmobile ones are all the same, only sometimes with more drones.  The game had yet again an excuse for not having civilians around, which is dissapointing, particularly because if there had been more missions and sidequests about helping civilians or making sure you didn't harm them, the Batmobile parts would have been smaller and better.<br /><br />Now, there are two things the Arkham Series has done that made it stand out between comic book games (or licensed games in general): it made you feel like Batman and it delivered interesting and engaging storylines.  This game fails at both.  You definitely feel like Batman when you're playing as him, but less so when you're controlling the Batmobile, smashing EVERYTHING in your path and killing people.  Oh, the game likes to pretend you don't kill, by changing from live ammo to rubber bullets when you're targeting people, and shooting an electric charge that repels people who get too close to the car's front, but your bullets will smash into other cars and make them crash in ways no one could survive.  Sometimes the people can't get out of the way fast enough, so they will electrocuted AND smashed by the car.  So, either you're killing those people, which is un-Batman-like or you're believing the games &#34;unconscious&#34; labels, which are absolutely unrealistic.<br /><br />Then there's the story.  And it's just bland and derivative.  Even Origins (which like this game was also not written by Paul Dini) had a better story.  I guess it wouldn't be such a bad tale if this is your first introduction to the Batman mythos, but if it isn't (and I don't see why should you start here) then you've seen everything before.  Furthermore, the story can only happen because Batman acts like an idiot sometimes.  And then there's the eponymous Arkham Knight.  Look, if you know anything about Batman, you figured out this guy's identity the moment the character was revealed when the game was announced.  If you don't know about Batman, the game will still make sure you know who he is halfway through it.  Yet then it dares to try to pass it off as a surprise.  And what happens after your confrontation with him is something you can't predict only if you've never seen a work of fiction before, or if half of your brain is in a jar for some reason (if that's the case, I recommend to stop reading right now and go get that checked out).  I'll grant you, the game does something unexpected at the end, but only because I wasn't expecting Batman to do something so profoundly stupid.<br /><br />Worst yet, you can't even see the ending until you complete enough side-quests.  And you can't see the entire thing until you do 100% on the Riddler challenges, of which there are just too many, some of which are so badly designed that you'll swear the developers are trolling you.  I know it was always going to be hard to top my expectations after Arkham City, but what's jarring is that the developers are failing here at something they absolutely excelled before.  There's no &#34;new gen&#34; problems here, and at least Origins had the excuse of being from different developers.  Sure, the game is still tons of fun, and with how long it is there's a lot of value for your money here, but I can't just ignore the problems with the game because they hurt the overall experience.<br /><br />So yeah, I give this game a 7 out of 10, which would be 3.5 stars, but since I can't give it that I give it four, since 3 feels like overkill.  It's still a great game and a must-play, but adjust your expectations accordingly.

COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE!	This skin is amazing! My biggest pet peeve with my ps4 was the how the shiny surface collects dust. I would wipe it off almost daily but that only put streaks in the dust and made it look worse. This skin stops the dust from collecting and looking awful and so much more! My review will be broken into sections for organization.<br /><br />APPLICATION:<br />  CONSOLE:It was pretty easy to put on, I unplugged my ps4 and placed it on the kitchen table so I would have a better view. I would suggest asking someone to help you, I had someone hold one end of the sticker while I made sure it was straight before beginning to stick it to the console. I imagine it could still be done quite easily without help but I am a bit of a perfectionist so I wanted to be sure.<br />  CONTROLLER: Very easy to place on the controller as well, it has a separate piece for the main part of the controller and the touch pad. As with the console I had someone else hold one side while I fit the other side over the buttons. This just made it a bit easier, and as I said above it is most likely not much more difficult without help.<br /><br />FIT:<br />  CONSOLE: Once the skin is on and any air bubbles are flattened out it looks like the Playstation came with the design on it, it fits perfectly and looks amazing. it even has the ps4 logo on the front right side making it look even more official.<br />  CONTROLLER: The fit for the controller surprised me, I was concerned with how it would feel with it surrounding the buttons as well as if I would be constantly fixing the edges where my hands hit it. This was not the case, the openings for the buttons are perfectly sized to give room and not interfere with pressing them at all, and I don't even notice the edges of the sticker while I'm holding the controller. Also the piece for the touch pad extends slightly over the top of the controller following the full shape if the touch pad and it doesn't interfere with the sensitivity of the touch pad at all, which was another concern I had.<br /><br />QUALITY:<br />  CONSOLE: The sticker is surprisingly tough, it is a thicker vinyl instead of a cheap paper sticker. This means that I can easily remove it and replaced it if I choose to do so. I feel it will also provide some protection from scratches because it is so thick.<br />  CONTROLLER: The sticker for the controller is made of the same material as the one for the console so it offers the same benefits.<br /><br />LOOK:<br />  CONSOLE: It looks even better than the picture in my opinion, after buying this I saw a couple others that I thought I would like more and considered canceling my order but I decided against it, and I'm glad I did. When it arrived I was shocked at how vibrant and amazing the colors looked.<br />  CONTROLLER: The design on the controller skins are the same as certain sections of the console skin, the one I used (and is shown in the picture) has more colors in it, while the other looks to be from the darker section of the console skin. This isn't a problem though because I feel as though if both were being used, having the controllers look different would allow you to be able to tell one from the other. I just chose the brighter one for my controller because I thought it was a bit nicer.<br /><br />OVERVIEW: Overall I absolutely love this skin set! It looks and fits amazingly and solves the problem of the dusty ps4, and it really gives the look and feel of a custom console. I completely recommend this to anyone looking to add a little personalization to their gaming system.	2015-08-18

It's a great JRPG, a great SRPG, a great SMT game, and a lovely improvement over the original DS version! Most of the features from Devil Survivor 2 made their way into this upgrade of the first game (except DeSu2's Fate system, sadly) and it really helps. I used to think, before these recent remakes, that DeSu had the better story while DeSu2 had the better gameplay - this remake evens the playing field a bit. As such, this game combines great gameplay with useful features/additions and a great atmosphere-driven story with interesting characters.<br /><br />That said, since this is a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off, be warned: it's difficult. Patience is not only a virtue but a must with these games. Certain monsters can and will one-hit you, and some bosses will need to be repeated until you get your strategy down. That said, the game is really fun once you get over that learning curve, and the story and characters really help push you along in that regard.<br /><br />The game is set in a modern-day Tokyo, where you and your companions have just been trapped in a government lockdown/quarantine of the area. You quickly learn that this has to do with the demons you discover, and in fact acquire through strange portable electronic devices (called &#34;COMPs,&#34; but clearly resemble a Nintendo DS/3DS) that are able to summon them. Communication is severed, demons start causing chaos, people start to panic, and your party finds themselves simply trying to survive day-to-day. This leads you to finding the cause of the lockdown, the origin of the demons, the COMPs, etc. and your decisions ultimately decide how, or even if, you try to fix things and end the lockdown or not. There are quite a few endings as a result that are, again in typical SMT fashion, often alignment-based (e.g. chaos, law/order, neutrality, etc.). You can even get a bad ending, but that's easy to avoid if you pay much attention at all.<br /><br />The gameplay is divided into two parts: non-combant and combat.<br /><br />Non-combat gameplay has a list of areas you can go to in the lockdown, with people you can talk to or events/battles to partake in. This all happens according to a 24-hour clock, meaning certain people can only be talked to at certain times and battles likewise can be time-limited. As such, you can leave characters to die if you know in advance they are in danger at a specific time and refuse to help them out. Your choices in this regard, i.e. who you talk to and such, will help shape and determine the course that your game takes and the final route and ending you get. So a general idea is to talk to plenty of people early on until you have an idea of who you agree with and ultimately want to help achieve their goals the most. And don't worry - you're not locked into a decision or anything until much later in the game, and it's black-and-white when you do finally decide what route you'll take.<br /><br />And also out of combat you get to buy demons (via &#34;Auction&#34; or the compendium of your past/current demons), fuse them (two demons become a third demon, with you losing the two you fused), changing up your teams/skills, etc.<br /><br />Combat gameplay takes place in individual skirmishes or fights that are made up of a local area, overlaid by a grid that determines movement. The flow is turn-based, with each player character (up to 4 at a time) and enemy character taking turns according to their speed. So you don't control all of your characters at once before ending your turn, and you don't get to choose which character of your goes when. This adds a need to strategize, of course. Once your character engages in combat with another, the gameplay momentarily departs from traditional grid-based SRPG games as it opens into a turn-based JRPG combat where you choose the actions for your character and their demons (up to two) and it happens at the same time as the enemy's actions - chronologically carried out by each individual's Agility stat. Theactual fighting involves a very interesting (even if sometimes frustrating) system of elements, resistances, and &#34;extra turns&#34; (i.e. extra actions, usually gained through critical hits or hitting an enemy's elemental weakness). This is something you'll definitely have to get a handle on in order to get through the game without rage-quitting.<br /><br />While it's a game where you absolutely need to have patience and be willing to learn the ins-and-outs of combat, I would recommend it to anyone that likes RPGs, JRPGs, SRPGs, or even other SMT games.actual fighting involves a very interesting (even if sometimes frustrating) system of elements, resistances, and &#34;extra turns&#34; (i.e. extra actions, usually gained through critical hits or hitting an enemy's elemental weakness).

Im a huge fan of zombie games in general but this one got me disappointed.    Disclaimer: I have only played about 3 hours of this game. Im writing the review now because i don't intend to go any further in the game as it got me fed up pretty quickly. Im just gonna list a few things that ruined the gameplay for me    1. Time  Why the hell do you add a time constraint in a game that is (in my opinion) a lot about free roaming. As a result, you miss out on a lot of side mission because you always have to find the damn anti-zombie shot (zombrex) for your daughter before its too late. I don't want to be stressed when i play video games, its about enjoying yourself. There is enough stress in our daily lifes. A game like this should be about shooting s*** up and loosen up.    2. Speed  I was expecting this game to be pretty hectic but its not. First the character runs so slowly. You can't sprint. I looked online and people say you can if you drop all items or whatever but i didn't manage to do it and the game didn't mention sprinting at all. Everything in this game seems slow. The attacks with the different weapons, the time it takes to pick up items, to open and close doors, etc.    3. Weapons durability  Why the hell did the developers thought it was a good idea to have the weapons wear out so quickly. For instance you'll pick up a weapon and, depending on the weapon, it will take about less than 100 kills before you have to throw away the weapon as its ruined. Why? Even if it was a real world apocalypse im pretty sure you could use a sledge hammer more than 50 times before it is ruined.    4. Mission  A lot of the missions are basically the same concept. Go find and help a survivor, bring him back to the safe house. Knowing that you run so slow, it take forever and its really boring to bring all this survivors back to the safe house.    That's it	2015-08-18

Heck of a lot of trouble to go through to make something look real, if you ask me. I'm pretty sure this one is real. Regardless, it works flawlessly.

US	4060702	RBLMU8IP34S6H	B00H01EXM8	692056066	MOGA Power Series iOS Mobile Game Controller (Only Works for iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s and iPod touch (5th generation) with iOS 7 or later)	Video Games	5	8	10	N	Y	Much cheaper than getting it new, and works just as well.	My older brother Gage got a MOGA Game Controller and the second I used it I knew I needed one. I read about it online and watched many videos, saying it was a gamer's best friend and a gamer necessity, so I was extremely excited to get on. Gage bought his used from a different seller on Ebay and it was great quality and worked perfectly. I couldn't afford a new one with my amazon gift card money, so I bought one used. It shipped extremely fast and I got it within days. It came in the box(ripped and taped, but that's expected with used items) so that was a nice bonus. It came with instructions, the charger(which was great because I saw super nervous it wouldn't come with one), a piece of paper saying thanks for buying my product, please leave a nice review, if anything's wrong please contact me and we can work something out, ect, ect(which is also nice to get because I saw the slip today and reminded me to write a review) and lastly, the controller. When I first got out the controller, I had a mini heart attack because it wouldn't fully open, luckily, it was because there was a lock option on the back that I had to switch off. I'm only saying that so no one makes the same mistake I did. I put the controller on my iphone and began to play a few games with it. It was(and still is) awesome to use. The buttons are a little loose, so I have to push harder on the A,X,B, and Y then the other buttons(which is hardly a problem). But other than that, the controller is perfect. Thank you!!	2015-08-18

This game is pegged to be the final installment in the Batman Arkham series. If you have not played the other 2 games, I'd seriously recommend you check them out (though they are by no means necessary in order to play Batman Arkham Knight).<br /><br />I'm not going to provide a full plot overview and character analysis, etc. if you'd like that I'd recommend stumbling over to http://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-knight/xbox-one-20014108. However, I'll say that this game will provide anyone who loves Batman with endless hours of fun. The game has an over-riding &#34;main&#34; plot that takes approximately 15-20 hours to complete.<br /><br />Once the main plot has been completed, the fun by no means stop. If anything, the real fun is about to begin as Batman Arkham Knight (like the other games in the series) is completely open world based. This means that you can go anywhere on the map, at anytime, to do anything you'd like.<br /><br />Batman Arkham Knight provides incredible replay value and is a game that can continuously be played even once it's been &#34;beat&#34;. Games like these are a smart investment for any gamer as you can pick it up and play anytime you'd like just to beat up some bad guys, drive the Batmobile around Gotham, or just enjoy the eye dropping graphics and city renderings. The game is massively impressive on all accounts.<br /><br />If you've never played the Batman Arkham games, do yourself a favor and pick this game up.	2015-08-18

I thought of the ability to have a PORTABLE black ops 1... or so I thought.<br />When I started I was in LOVE with the Call of Duty franchise, ( I even have black ops 1 on the ps3), but when I first started instantly noticed these things:<br /><br />First, the graphics just STINK. Not even stink they SUCK. When I played I don't know what to heck I was seeing. Was it a explosion or just a red circle. They are so horrible I thought to myself to just play the console version. JUST GET THE CONSLE VERSION!!!! Way better.<br /><br />Second, are the controls. It was very hard for me to turn even when my sensitivity was 10! I could not aim at all. Use your stylus its better, but if you don't have one or can't aim well you're screwed. Also, what were Activision thinking trying to fit a ps3 controller into a DS its just impossible to run and sprint. In the Console Version it was better.<br /><br />Third, is the storyline. JUST NO  I WON'T EXPLAIN!!! Basically, if you are a good/great Call of Duty player you'll breeze through this and then you'll have nothing to do.<br /><br />Lastly, are the Zombies. Zombies suck. Just suck. No way at all am I playing a one hit kill without Pack 'a Punch or Perks. The only time you see a zombie is when it is too late. ONE HIT AND YOU'RE OUT! That's like just giving away you're life especially on high rounds. Its just so hard and infuriating. Not fun like the console version.<br /><br />I think the only reason it has such good reviews is because people haven't played the console version. Sorry, but it stinks.	2015-08-18

I love the re-mastered version of the game. it's just a little different in some ways, like entering and exiting vehicles is way faster and the grenades throw out and straight rather than the older up and out. also, I feel like the jumping is less high and floaty. still super great playing the old campaign and at any time while in game you can hit select button and change back to the old graphics. super cool.<br /><br />My copy didn't come with an insert in the case, so I don't have a manual or the code to download the maps for multi player. I am not sure why my copy was missing it's innards. it was a &#34;New&#34; copy, but it was obviously opened and the paperwork removed. kinda lame ;(<br /><br />Also, I see a lot of people complaining about the multiplayer being terrible. but I cant see anyone buying this game to play multiplayer, buy a newer halo reach for that. they remade some of the maps, but not the one people are upset about. for under $20 it's a great buy.	2015-08-18

If you want to get into Kingdom Hearts, this is the way to start, as the original is the most engaging in the series in terms of challenge and content, and I even had fun with its semi-sequel with its unique turn-based combat. The original has been improve to allow cutscene-skipping and additional content in the Japan-only Final Mix, and they add a lot more challenge and replayability than before! The bonus cutscenes for 358/2 Days were good, too, but I think it would have been nice to actually play the game in HD.<br /><br />My only major complaint was from the retailer that sold this game--the disc came loose off the game box when I received it in the mail, which should have been fixed. Thankfully, it was not damaged, or else I would have complained a long time ago.<br /><br /> Pick this up, and you'll know what the fuss is about Kingdom Hearts III...well, for the most part. I recommend this game for JRPG fans who happen to like Disney characters and movies.	2015-08-18

You will need the WiiU GamePad controller, Wii Balance Board, Wii Remote Plus, Wii Nunchuk, and WiiU meter during different activities. I have been having a great time using theWiiU Fit w/Fit meter. The WiiU Fit has enough variety & activities (Yoga, balance games, and dance, aerobic, and strength exercises) to change up the fun. The meter has a strong clip but this is the first pedometer I haven't lost because I can store in a pocket and it still works. The meter tracks your activity (steps taken, calories burned, elevation changes) then you sync it to your WiiU which maintains daily logs.<br />I have been using for over 60 days and the WiiU Fit has added challenges as I get stronger. As I &#34;keep at it&#34; my waist-line is getting smaller, I stand taller and I feel as if I have more energy. LOVE IT!	2015-08-18

Horrible.  I thought all I had to do was plug it into my ps3 usb and it would work like magic...Boy was I wrong!! I had to move the controller around.  I had to reset it.. And that's pretty much what my sons have to do for it to work, each and every time they want to use it.  Now three weeks there's another problem.  When you try playing A game the main character would move on its own..So we reset the controller  and plug it out for hours, the problem persist...Finally we had to buy a new controller.

To be completely honest, after the battery was installed, my Game Boy could run playing Advance Wars for days. Overall, this was an awesome buy, and shows why I really like Amazon.	2015-08-18

Ignoring the fact that this game will crash on you every few hours, it is an excellent game. Other reviewers have gone into the details of why this is, don't feel like repeating them. I will give advice on the order to play the DLCs. I would start with Honest Hearts, as it is the easiest and doesn't directly relate to the other 3 DLCs. Then I would do Old World Blues, followed by Dead Money, then Lonesome Road. The back stories of some characters in Dead Moeny are explained in Old World Blues, and Dead Money is much more difficult. Lonesome Road should 100% come last, due to the story revolving around some sort of final conflict. Also make sure you complete the DLCs (and any other side quests you want to do) before finishing the main questline. You cannot continue to play after.	2015-08-18

I have been playing Metal Gear, since the days of just Metal Gear on NES. I've played through all the existing games, even VR Missions and the PSP turn-based games. Over the years, I have found all of them enjoyable to some degree. I thoroughly enjoyed Raiden's character in MGS4 and when I found out that Metal Gear Rising was starring Raiden in the time after MGS4, I had to give it a look. My fear, was that the departure from MGS-style gameplay might take away from the game, I was incorrect in this assessment. The departure from MGS-Style gameplay is precisely what the franchise needs in terms of development. Raiden's character has developed past his initial appearance in MGS2 and the end result is a very fun, very playable, fast paced, and exciting adventure.<br /><br />My take is the gameplay is very reminiscent of another favorite Kojima project of mine, Zone of the Enders. If you enjoyed ZOE, back in the day, you'll love MGR. If you didn't, you're going to hate this game. If you're expected elements of stealth, or heck even a convoluted storyline that leaves you guessing ala MGS, wrong game, you'll hate it. But fast pace, intense focus, and perfect timing are required in this game. Patience is the real winner in MGS, aggression is the winner in MGR. Right so a bit more about gameplay, levels are exceptionally linear with minimal places to investigate and go, backtracking is virtually non-existent. The environments aren't particularly varied, nor are the levels particularly long. You do get plenty of baddies to chop up, which you're going to want to enjoy Raiden's badass ninja moves. Control is fluid, intuitive, and very well executed, which is a hallmark of the MG-Franchise.<br /><br />The game progresses quickly and even on Hard Difficulty, I am able to beat it in under 3 hours. Which leads me to probably my biggest complaint of the game, lack of depth. It's not difficult after just a few playthroughs to have in essence unlocked all of the weapons, skills, costumes, etc. While replay value is high, because you'll enjoy destroying things and cyborgs, the overall end result of Story Mode is disappointing. The story here is one-dimensional and the critics of Raiden's character have plenty of ammunition to use against him. In addition, components of the plot do not make any sense, until you play the two DLCs through (both of which can be completed quickly). After that things get a bit more clear, but even still, you're left underwhelmed by the character development and story-integration throughout the game. The game relies heavily on Codec-style dialog to convey the story. It gets annoying, quickly, to be consistently interrupted by the damn floating screens. This isn't solely an MGR fault, it is an over-reliance by Kojima on dialogue to convey the plot and move things along in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, at times it feels like you spend more time in endless dialogue messages, than you do enjoying that stellar gameplay. Fortunately, you can fast forward through the dialogue conveyed via Codec and skip cutscenes, but it doesn't stop the pop-ups from occurring regularly and interrupting your flow. Finally, I'll say that the mechanics and control of the game are fluid, but there is a real lack of depth in terms of combinations and weapons. The fact that you spend the entire game staring at a dagger on Raiden's back, that he never once uses, is the point that reinforces the meat that Kojima and Platinum Games left on the bone. Did they forget the stunningly beautiful cut scenes of Raiden in MGS4 that quickly? I wanted nothing more than to integrate some of the very moves Raiden uses against Vamp, but NO - they don't exist in the game. That's a real shame, a huge shame. In addition to the lack of fighting combinations and depth, Raiden's super strength and speed, are not adequately displayed or conveyed. The consistent slowdown to use blade-mode in Zandatsu kills, interrupts the flow of the game. With work you can start to use the environment in your fights, but Raiden's jumping/running/moving abilities feel so &#34;ground&#34; limited. It's a shame they weren't more fully developed and utilized.<br /><br />Final Verdict - I love this game, but I admit to being a proud Raiden fan. I would rate it about 7.5 on a standard scale of 10. Imminently playable and fun, you probably won't regret buying it, as long as you recognize that it isn't Metal Gear Solid. The gameplay is solid, with very few annoying issues, the story and characters are all pretty flat, except perhaps Raiden. The story is typical Kojima, excessively complex and convoluted, with an over-reliance on Deus Ex Machina and standard literary tropes to convey the plot. The real shame though, is not the storyline, it's the lack of depth in terms of fighting and movement in a fluid and otherwise beautifully programmed physics engine that gives you pretty much all that you want. Combine this with the rather boring, generic, and bland environments, and you see the real tragedy of MGR isn't that it isn't MGS, which it never pretends to be, it's that it isn't as good as it could be.	2015-08-18

Those who enjoy fast-paced, hack-n-slash games with RPG elements will love Shadow of Mordor. This game, like the Arkham games, will appeal not only to fans of the LOTR franchise but to all gamers who enjoy action-packed, combat-driven games.<br /><br />Graphics 8/10: The graphics were stunning. However, the scenery was sometimes repetitive. Some of the characters faces were underwhelming for a next gen game, thus the 8/10.<br /><br />Gameplay 10/10: Fluid and fast. The combat was impeccable, other than a minor thing where you can attack your own soldiers. I really enjoyed the combos and being able to massacre orcs Aragorn-style. This was the game play experience I always wanted from a LOTR title but never had until now.<br /><br />Story 7/10: It's hard for a LOTR fan to tell exactly how and where this story diverges from Tolkien lore. Many of the characters and settings are re-used, however certainly Talion's story-line is fictional. My ideal storyline would be one that takes a Middle-Earth character such as Celebrimbor and allows us to play through his life, rather than inventing a fictional character.	2015-08-18

Pros- fun to explore, to discover new secrets, can play again and again without getting bored, not too violent for young kids, love seeing the movie(s) within the game, lots of puzzles to solve, fun changing into different dinosaurs, and literally hours of fun!<br />Cons- glitches....it locks up, freezes, and characters get stuck- especially when building things or jumping on trampoline/ jump pads.. my advice is to save often so if you do get stuck in a glitch it is less annoying.<br />Bottom lie: A great buy, hours of fun, highly recommend to buy!

Game is near perfect but it is seriously lacking in boss fights. Infact there isnt even a final boss fight in this game. I had hopes for the Arkham Knight fight but it is just bad. I dont see how this happens compared to previous batman games. I remember trying to beat slade for over an hour in the last batman game. the fight with him in this game is a joke compared to that. Most boss fights here just consist of spawning an annoying amount of common thugs around you. other than that the game delivers.	2015-08-18

US	2400829	ROLPKQVIBGAU0	B00C1ZBFTW	565256424	Shin Megami Tensei IV - Nintendo 3DS	Video Games	5	0	0	N	Y	Good SMT game and JRPG, while serving as a nice introduction to the franchise for beginners.	Overall it's a great RPG, and would be a nice introduction for beginners to the Shin Megami Tensei franchise and spin-off series. First tip/warning: have patience - it can be difficult, at least in the beginning. It does get easier as the game progresses and as you get the hang of the combat and demon fusion systems, so don't worry too much if the early bosses (I'm looking at you, Minotaur and Medusa) give you trouble.<br /><br />The atmosphere and gameplay are top-notch, although the overworld, which you don't deal with until a little later into the game, admittedly leaves quite a bit to be desired. There's an incredible diversity in demons and skills, so you'll have to play through a couple times or more in order to see them all. Bosses are fun and interesting, even if their difficulty ranges from a cakewalk to having to restart multiple times until you get lucky.<br /><br />The only downside are the characters, in my opinion, which are a bit flat and serve very one-dimensional plot purposes. The three companions each represent different alignment extremes (law/order, chaos, neutrality), and sometimes act more as caricatures than real people, but they do have their enjoyable moments and don't weigh the game down. Through most of the game you go into a battle and one of them will be randomly chosen to assist your party, and they are controlled by the AI. While they don't carry themselves nearly as well as your character or your demons, they can be useful.<br /><br />And the story is entertaining in typical SMT fashion - dealing with themes of law/order, chaos, and neutrality mixed in with references to religion, philosophy, mythology, and sometimes modern issues. The course of the story is ultimately decided by alignment choices you make through dialogue or actions throughout the game, which results in one of a few different endings (three normal endings, and one &#34;bad&#34; ending).<br /><br />I would recommend the game to anyone that likes RPGs, especially JRPGs, that has a little patience. You will certainly need it.	2015-08-18

Bought for my son who was glued to his computer all summer, he did not know glasses like these were available and at first did not want them and told me to return them. I encouraged him to give them a try, explaining to him the other reviews said that they helped with eye strain. He balked at first (he is 16), he gave them a try to make me happy (and probably to shut me up ;-)  Anyhow, after he gave them an honest try, I noticed the next day he had them on without me telling him to, so I asked him if he liked them now. He said they really helped in certain darker screens (twilight looking games), they made seeing everything clearer. They really did help with his gaming and made me happy that possibly it would prevent eye strain and save his eyes a bit. Well worth the price on that alone. Thank you to other gamers for your honest reviews! I would not have given them a try or even known about them without you. Kudos to all! Since I'm not a gamer myself, i rely on your helpful honest reviews.<br /><br />Hope this will encourage other parents to give them a try, good luck!	2015-08-18

I had the older models, which after two years finally gave up the ghost. These are a bit more colorful and feel somehow more durable when held hand in hand against the older models.<br /><br />It's  a niche item for multi console owners but I do prefer these over my PS4/XB1 controller docks; the LEDs are easy to see at a glance to check charge status, and the plastic supports the controllers so they aren't completely supporting their weight on the charging dock. They keep your controllers off the shelf and allow you to charge at the same time, so they're a win in terms of clutter reduction. They can be a bit tough to dust though. Balance is good and there is no risk of them falling over. The power cable is slender and routed through the base so it doesn't sit all askew.	2015-08-18

Good game, to much of a story and not enough game play but I got this on sale for $20 here and it was worth that all day and even a bit more. The graphics look great for a console and the story is awesome, the atmosphere of London in 1886 is very cool. I wish there were more things to pick up and look at, more places to explore and that the game was longer but I am looking forward to thew sequel.	2015-08-18

I had Turtle Beach for my Xbox 360 that I liked until the cable connecting the headset to the controller shorted out about a year later, so purchasing another Turtle Beach headset I was a little wary. I wish I hadn't convinced myself to purchase another one. I haven't had this headset a month yet and the microphone stick that connects to the headset no longer works. It lasted all of 3 weeks. Don't waste your money here, you can find a better headset for less money elsewhere. It's also uncomfortable (and hot) to wear and the sound is actually garbage. The previous Turtle Beach headsets I had, had better sound than this set does.	2015-08-18

You know? For such a cheap mouse it's not half bad. I bought this as a quick and dirty backup when my larger and far more expensive Logitech MX was dying. Obviously you have to lower your expectations a bit for the price. It's not particularly accurate compared to higher end mice. It's small and very lightweight. It's probably not a good choice for production or using for long periods of time, such as at work. But on the flip side of that coin, it's a great general purpose mouse for the casual user. Probably perfect for kids or people with small hands, or for people like me who just needed a cheap mouse in a pinch. This mouse now resides in a drawer, where it will stay until the next pinch. :D	2015-08-18

And the best part is that with this cable I can charge it within the Wii U itself or any USB wall adapter that can support the proper amps. And the best part is? The cable only cost $10 bucks with a warranty! Woo-hoo :) The closest I could find was on ebay for an original cable for $18 and no warranty and of course the suoer thin unreliable cable that it had. Great product and unbeatable price. This one's a keeper.	2015-08-18

With the help of the holy maiden Victoria, the humans fought against the evil beings and sealed them away with the abilities of the libras.  Eventually, the Demon God was sealed away and humans started to rule the land.<br /><br />A  little over one hundred years later, monsters are starting to rise up and wreak havoc among the populace.  Just as Fried Einhard graduated and became a libra, he's quickly dispatched to suppress the monster threats in the nearby caves, forests, and temples.  At first he's on his own to map out dungeons, but he quickly gets help from a couple of attractive females that fawn over his school-boyish looks.<br /><br />The female party members do all of the fighting while Fried seals away the final bosses that lurk in each area.  Other than the sealing, you don't see much of Fried, but you do get to hear from him often while exploring.  I do like the banter and silly conversations that ensue.  While the dialogue is great, I wasn't able to understand it without the English subtitles as it's all voiced in Japanese.<br /><br />The 2D visuals in this game are very anime-like and the females, both friendly and otherwise, have big eyes and breasts that are often shown generously.  To say that there is fan service in this Dungeon Travelers 2 is an understatement.  While there are skeleton and spider enemies, they are portrayed as females with very little clothing. It gets even worse in boss battles when the pretty, yet aggressive female's outfit gets literally torn to shreds.  In the end, they are covering up what very little is left to the imagination.<br /><br />Besides the humanoid enemies, there are aggressive cherries, bananas, oranges, melons, and apples.  As you fight more and more enemies, you can create seal books that will  power up various stats of the party members and allow them to see the monster's stats in battle.  When bosses are stripped and beaten, Fried can make a master seal book that he can equip for extra abilities such as higher critical attacks or more monster (if you really want to call them that) encounters.<br /><br />Up to five party members can accompany Fried in his missions.  Active party members will gain experience from battles, and as they level up, skill points are earned that can unlock new attacks/abilities or increase the power of existing ones.  There are different classes of characters ranging from fighters, magic users, maids, bards, scouts, samurais, and more.  As they level up, their classes can be upgraded and they'll become more powerful.  Their outfits change as well and sometimes get to be more revealing.<br /><br />Later in the game, side quests become available and can unlock new areas, items, and upgrades.  Inventory space is very limited, so you'll have to return to the Royal Library to identify and sell unneeded equipment and items.  Weapons and armor cannot be equipped unless they have been identified first.  Make sure you have enough inventory space before embarking on a mission or a quest or you can lose out on some good loot.  If your bag is full in battle, you won't have a chance to clean it out to make room for any new items and will miss out on the items won in battle.<br /><br />The battles are turn-based and the fighting order is established by the character's weight.  The lighter players are more agile and quicker to attack. If the party's morale is high enough, a combo attack or ability becomes available to use.  Casting spells is not instant and magic users need time to cast it without being attacked as it will slow them down even more.  Be sure to have your strong characters in front and your weaker ones in back to avoid them getting pummeled in battle.  If a player gets knocked out, they will not earn experience again until they are revived by an item, ability,  or by exiting the area.<br /><br />Each area is automatically mapped out as it is explored.  Exits, ladders, treasure chests, pitfalls, and traps are all automatically notated on the map.  Some areas are only visible when you investigate walls for hidden entrances or use a flashlight to reveal them.  If your party is in bad shape and you need to quickly vacate, emergency exits are available as loot and for purchase in the store.  There are random ice cream, ramen, and item merchants roaming around that can sell revitalizing items to your party.<br /><br />The pacing is good and I didn't feel overwhelmed during the battles.  The bosses usually took me a try or two to beat them.  Like many RPGs, some grinding may be necessary if the enemies and bosses are too challenging.  An extra level or two can make a big difference.<br /><br />While Dungeon Travelers 2: The Royal Library & The Monster Seal does a lot of things right as a dungeon crawling RPG game, I cannot recommend it due to the over-sexualization of the female characters and monsters in this game.  If people don't mind the racy artwork they will enjoy the game.

To much milking the consumer for just not enough content. I feel like developers are trying to find this balance of getting the most while doing the least and Destiny went way to far in one direction. It was worth playing to level up and enjoy the experience with my friends but not to keep paying a developer who thinks I am to stupid to know better.	2015-08-18

After years of watching Zaranyzerak play the Dead Space games on youtube, I got a PS3 JUST to play all three games. Very cool. I thought that the controls were a lot better in this second game. DS2 isn't as creepy as the first game, but the gameplay is much improved. And you actually get to hear Issac speak in this game....though I'm not sure that that's a good thing. I liked it when he was silent. DS2 is much harder than the first game, though after you play it through a few times and build up upgraded weapons, nodes, and suit and suit power, it's not so tough.	2015-08-18

US	2710365	R33NV124FDVPYN	B003O6HDHA	132125193	Silent Hill: Downpour	Video Games	3	0	0	N	Y	A decent silent hill game.	I am a silent hill fan that has played every single silent hill, what I can say for downpour I prefer to call it silent hill 8 though... is that its an okay game its worth playing but not great.  Here is a little review for what I think of this game.(don't worry I am not going to spoil anything.)<br /><br />Story: Downpour starts out pretty good it gets you asking what might happen in the game however a quarter of the game doesn't take place in silent hill but just outside it you make your into silent hill though and if you want the games story to be like the old silent hill games you will not find it here there is no cult or anything like that its just about the main character which is okay but it doesn't go very far like silent hill 2. overall the story is just bland its a &#34;been there done that&#34; story which is a shame.<br /><br />Gameplay: Now where on to the important stuff,  the most irritating thing about this game was that your weapons break but thats not the reason why I am writing this down, the reason is that some weapons are specifically required to progress in the game so if your ready to go to the next area and your axe breaks and the only way to move on is to break the wooden boards blocking the door then you are out of luck and have to back track and find another one and axes are not common in this game that is why it is vital to remember where you last saw one or like i did pick a safe area and drop whatever you find there. The fighting in this game is mostly melee and sometimes you do not have a choice but to fight there is a power system in the game its really unclear how it is used until you see that a powerful attack will sometimes show the screen slowing down a little bit. another annoying aspect to the game is there is very little variety of enemies and they are all very annoying one screams in your face another hits and runs you get the gist there are no bosses so you don't have yo worry about that, one thing i will note that will sometimes act like a boss is a red sphincter this is where *real fun is. the sphincter is on multiple levels and is the last thing you ever want to see ever the main character screams constantly and it never stops the levels that it appears in is also one huge labyrinth so most of the time you have no idea where you going and this thing can kill you fast. An Important note is that this silent hill is huge and can be disorienting at times there are also a lot of side quests some of them are cool while others you just hate but want the reward. Lastly is the puzzle sections they are like a calm time where you don't get interrupted which is nice but some of them require a lot of patience.<br /><br />Characters: There are not many characters in this game and are not memorable not even the main character sadly, they are also very stereotypical some will annoy you others are just meh.The only thing I can really say is that I liked the interaction between the main character and the mysterious mailman.<br /><br />Overall: yeah this game is good and has a lot of cameos and unlockable costumes which I personally love but it lacks in so many other areas I hope this review helps in your decision to purchase this game.	2015-08-18

You're in the right place.	This is -- without a doubt -- the best mouse I've ever used. Gone are the days of buying unresponsive, uncomfortable, 3 button mice at Office Depot for $30+. For only $7, you get a 5 button mouse with adjustable sensitivity, and it's fitted to your grip just for kicks, with a place for every finger to rest on. Two of my family members tried this after I got it and had me buy one for them. Also if you're in the market for a keyboard as well then for less than $10 more you can get one with this mouse bundled in (and they share a single usb port!), I bought one of those for my other computer. Unless you're in the market for some uber serious gaming mouse with 20 buttons and liquid cooling to prevent sweaty palms, this is the mouse for you.  Seriously, just get one. (Or two, why not at this price?)	2015-08-18

Honestly!	Update- May 20, 2016- mouse is still working great. There have been zero issues with it. This mouse is my new favorite brand!<br /><br />I am sitting here with a new mouse on my computer. When I purchased it, I was a skeptic, a major skeptic. I am a fan of another brand and that is the only brand mouse I ever purchase.<br /><br />What was wrong with me? I allowed my closed mind to keep me from purchasing an even better quality mouse. This mouse works so much better than the brand I was to which I was loyal! It flies around my computer screen, very responsive. I found it easy to set up and I love the sleep feature.<br /><br />Mice tend to stay awake all the time and eat batteries. My other brand needs batteries replaced every few months if I forget to turn it off. This mouse has a sleep mode. That is very helpful for me to have. Plus, it's a one AA battery mouse, a savings right there!	2015-08-18

Ubisoft, Why...Why...Why do you force me to give my favorite gaming franchise of all time such a low overall rating for one of it's releases?  It's killing me to do so like a wristblade in my neck but I'm hoping that it will prevent this travesty from happening to the next PC release.  This mess had to be the result of outsourcing a strictly console game to a low balled PC conversion facility to make it classifiable and sellable as a PC game. It's unfair and frankly unconscionable that a company would do this to an AAA level title to squeeze out more profit at the expense of killing the quality and reputation of the franchise while screwing over loyal customers. In no real order is a list of some of my grievances regarding the PC release of this title only as I don't game on consoles expressly for the reason that I don't want to be bound by their hardware limitations and thus software limitations that must be programmed for it.  (1) Performance - I struggled for weeks of adjusting the settings to get this thing to run mostly acceptable on my i7-2600K & Nvidia 780 GPU overclocked but it still lags some so I'm waiting to finish the game until after I upgrade my CPU and GPU this black Friday (JUST TO RUN A CONSOLE LEVEL GAME).  (a) The game is so broken for the PC, I spent over a week of troubleshooting crashes and failure to load saves everytime I went online with Ubisoft only to figure/find out that their online save system was given higher precedence than my local copy and everytime they would force upload a copy of my save, it would be corrupted by their servers to where the game wouldn't load their copy thus not start. The solution I devised was to go OFFLINE from Ubisoft to play the game and then it will only use your local saves so I have to do this all the time just to play the game. I told them about it but they don't seem to care and look to be trying to move past this game as fast as possible rather than own up to it shortcomings.  (b) Also, this is imperative to anyone using the DVD copy of the game instead of digital download on 64 bit Windows. Another week of useless Ubi tech support forced me to figure/find out that the game won't update itself from Ubisoft if installed from DVD because it automatically installs to &#34;Program Files&#34; but Ubi digital download installs to &#34;Program Files(x86)&#34; and refuses to or can't update installs to &#34;Program Files&#34;. So you'll find the game doesn't run without the update but for some reason you can't get the update from them. So just input your code into Uplay and digital install and forget using the disks to avoid problems. Also, I told them and again don't seem to care.  (2) IT'S A CONSOLE GAME with unoptimized tweaks for PC - It's an appalling conversion and no less of a travesty and disgusting display of corporate greed to let it be released than was the new Batman release which was honorably pulled from the shelves to save franchise face.  (a) The game menu selection screen starts with a big cursor in the middle of the screen obviously for a controller input because it doesn't respond with a mouse at all making a PC player think the game or mouse is malfunctioning right from the start so a big screw you to mouse users.  (b) Map cursor doesn't respond to mouse or player set movement keys as it's designed for a controller or the forced ported settings of WASD keys so another screw you to mouse users.  (3) IMMERSION KILLING design and limitations (which are likely a result of console limitations not upgraded for PC users because Ubisoft respects your money but not your game system choice.)  (a) Mirrors in game have no reflection in 2015 but was possible in Duke Nukem 3D circa 1996...sad.  (b) Graphic anomolies and tearing in many areas and buildings.  (c) Lag & stuttering in the cutscenes is sometimes worse than the game...how can that be?  (d) You can't open a window not already open so a room full of windows is a prison unless someone opened an escape for you.  (e) 2nd floors of some buildings actually have no stair access to them as if the building was designed for people who regularly climb up the outside of their house to enter it.  (f) Loot chests are placed in some of the most ridiculous places that it feels as immersive as passing a car in the sky of a flight simulator. It would have been better to animate pulling a loose stone out of wall for the loot than seeing a big formal chest in a stupid location.  (g) Parquor abilities and animations are now appallingly apparent to be superheroesque compared to previous versions which fought off the tempations of disbelief. Vertical leaps while climbing up a wall here make Michael Jordan look like an utter joke on his best single floor jump.  (h) No interactions with the animals like previous versions allowed so the theme here is de-Evolution of gaming quality is the future.  (i) The hawk at the pinnacle of the lookouts has been downgraded in quality and focus so again previous games much better.  (j) No Fist Fighting? What? The game makes you stab two people at the beginning who were miffed with you for something you did but instead of beating them up like what would be plausible, YOU HAD TO STAB THEM WITH A SWORD and make the assumption that you were so good that you did it in a way that was mostly harmless and believe the fact that they would attempt to kill you for a minor issue! PREVIOUS GAMES HAD FIST FIGHTING for resolving minor disputes and challenges.  (k) They changed the look of the game and especially the characters and people to look like a friggin DISNEY movie. It looses so much sense of brooding and seriousness to the game and objectives when your expecting everyone to burst out in song and birds to land on your shoulder. Again, this must have been done to placate to a younger generation of kiddy console players thus destroying the proper feel of previous titles.  (l) No Skill backstory or justification! All of a sudden, you are this person with awesome abilities to fight and parquor up the side of buildings with no understanding of how this developed nor allowing the player to develop the skills themselves as if it's normal for someone to be able to do this without reason or training. Previous games didn't make you feel unjustified to have the skills and abilities that you had like this. It would have been easy to set a backstory that he was like the game THIEF where he stole to survive and garnered skills needed to survive from stealing from the rich like a Robin Hood. That's the one I mentally instilled in my own head in order to accept the crap I'm able to do without training.  (m) Game starts out forcing you to fight as a Templar and kill Assassins.  Thank you geniuses.  Great way to bond you to the side that you will be playing in the game by forcing you to kill the side you will be working on. That really instills a sense of loyalty and player focus as to your goals. At least in ACIII, you didn't know he was a Templar till later so it was an awesome twist of fate so again so much better previously.  (n) Low quality NPC textures likely used due to console limitations and almost no interactibility or canned responses with bystander NPC's make the world feel quite stagnant and removed.  (4) Your character is not really likable, respectable, honorable or redeemable in a way that makes you proud or content in playing him with the limited backstory you were given for him nor for his reason's for becoming a full fledged and dedicated Assassin. It's more like life forced him into it so he's just going with the flow or that he must become an Assassin simply because he can read the invisible code. Must you become Superman just because you can fly? It's just not honorable to be something because you had little choice than if you did and you made a difficult choice and that's the problem with this character in that he is doing what he is doing just to basically save his own arse rather than a sense of justice or an epiphany.  So given this list without even having finished the game yet as I want to overload my system with top end hardware to force this unoptimized hunk of crappy coding to run at a stable and enjoyable framerate rather than be annoyed here and there with lagging issues, I must say that it is a huge disappointment!  This feeling is based more on playing it's predecessors that were mostly targeted to PC players and while each of them had their quirks, they were on the whole amazing and enjoyable works of art that respected and used the PC to it's greater abilities. On the other hand, this monstrosity is the reason true PC gamers despise console half breeds as games now are often developed only up to the limitations of a single console and then released to all systems with a few modifications to sell the cheapest produced product possible with the greatest income potential by adding compatibility modifications. The problem with this is seen here with the De-Evolution of PC gaming where it was already proven that it can and was better and they actually had the nerve to sell you something that wasn't fit for PC nor ready for release which felt like they put a Ferrari emblem on a Ford Focus and sold it to you as a Ferrari.  Thus, my two star scoring is based on the fact that the game quality COMPARED to it's predecessors is basically 0 stars but the game still has an essence of AC if you can get it to run decently enough and if you are itching for some more as I was and can look past an endless list of shortcomings then there is some fun and enjoyment to be had here. So, while you may be balled from pulling your hair out at the end of it, a dedicated fan of the franchise may be able to satiate their fix with this until the next release assuming Ubisoft has learned any lesson here or if this really is the death of PC gaming and quality is ruled by the limitations of the current console versions as shown here. Ubisoft's next release will likely answer this question and whether the recall of Batman for PC had any influential impact on a commitment to quality or not for them.  UPDATE: I'm not sure if Ubisoft did any more optimizations to the game but after buying a Geforce 980TI 6GB video card, the majority of graphical problems have disappeared and the game is actually playable and looks good now which shouldn't be a surprise for the 2nd best card available to PC users.  Surprisingly, the game quality has improved from the beginning sequences which is wierd since you usually want to put your best foot forward for a good first impressionl.  So, with those two issues drastically improved I feel like the &#34;meat&#34; of the game deserve an upgrade to an &#34;Okay&#34; 3 Star rating.  It still has the majority of developmental problems/design issues listed above so it doesn't deserve ratings comparable to it's predecessors and I still play &#34;Offline&#34; to avoid problems so that is the best I can give it.	2015-08-18

One of my favorites, for sure.<br />The environment is very open, for the most part, although there are certainly areas where you aren't allowed to go. It would be nice if the entire environment was open (like not having only certain scale-able areas on cliffs where you can climb, for instance). Only a couple of other minor quibbles. But all in all, very well done. I love the perspective, and story line is pretty good. Looking forward to the improvements in the next iteration...	2015-08-18

US	43796190	R33GY4MYJGUDNG	B0076ZQSFI	41375597	Sleeping Dogs	Video Games	5	0	0	N	N	A whole lotta fun!	It's probably impossible to describe Sleeping Dogs without bringing Grand Theft Auto IV into the conversation.  I'll only say this:  I enjoyed Sleeping Dogs way, way, way more than GTA IV.  GTA IV was certainly a good game, but there was just so much about it that was broken - the clunky combat, the poor driving physics, ridiculous check points, etc.  Sleeping Dogs suffers none of these maladies.  After having played it on both PS3 and PC, I think I can safely say it's jumped into my All Time Top 10 (others in the Top 10 include Mass Effect 2, Bad Company 2, Red Dead Redemption, Need 4 Speed: Shift and Hot Pursuit, Uncharted 2, etc).  It's a spectacular game on just about every level.<br /><br />What I like most about Sleeping Dogs is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's a bit pulpy, a bit over-the-top, a bit silly;  there are times when tongue is firmly inserted in cheek.  But it's all presented so perfectly that you totally buy into it.  Sleeping Dogs is full of great characters and takes places in a beautifully rendered Honk Kong.  There's no shortage of things to do be it missions, races, side jobs, collectables, etc.  I would guess it'd take you upwards of 30 hours to complete.  That's pretty good value in my book.  And the voice actor roster is a veritable who's who of great Chinese, American-Chinese, Korean, etc, actors.  Also, Emma Stone.  Seriously, check out IMDB.  Great talent all around.<br /><br />My only concern about the PS3 edition is the motorcycle handling.  It's just bad, bad, bad.  They're nearly impossible to control at high speed.  I also had some issue with unresponsive controls during fight sequences.  The textures on the PS3 are especially good, but that's to be expected.  If you have the opportunity, buy the Definitive Edition for PC or PS4.  Greatly improved textures and vehicle handling.<br /><br />As an  open world game, you really can't do any better than Sleeping Dogs.  It's one heckuva a lot of fun.	2015-08-18

This is a great piece of nostalgia for anyone who has fond memories of football from the late 90s and early 00s who is also into gaming.

It sounds grindy	This game was my first entry in the Monster Hunter series, and what a ride it's been. The central idea of the game is a simple loop: Kill boss monster, use its parts to make gear, use gear to kill stronger monsters and make better gear. It sounds grindy, and it absolutely is, but it manages to make each fight fun and intense. The gameplay, however, is somewhat unorthodox in that it plays as an action game with RPG elements, but is very slow and methodical. Depending on what weapon you use, movement speed ranges from a relaxed jog to a plodding, snail-like waddle. This isn't helped by the fact that before you actually get to battle a boss, you need to complete several quests where you simply collect herbs or smack around cannon fodder enemies. Once you do hit that point, however, the game shifts into high gear. Each boss is full of personality, from the giant raptor that barks orders to its pack to the flame-spewing chicken that runs around wildly to the four-legged shark that encases itself in ice armor. To fight them is an exercise in observation, preparation and patience. Every large monster has a variety of tells before each attack, and you can't take much more than four or five good hits before dropping, making it a fast-paced challenge where you're constantly looking for openings, more Punch-Out!! than Devil May Cry. To make the fight easier, you could bring traps, or craft Flash Bombs to stun the monster. Maybe you should break its horn to get a rare drop, or chop off its tail to throw it off balance. If you're successful, you collect some body parts, and inevitably find out that you need 4 more to upgrade your weapon. Speaking of which, the weapon variety in this game is ridiculous. 11 melee and 3 ranged weapons classes, each with enormous, branching upgrade paths. Perhaps this one deals fire damage, while that one could paralyze... but the other one has better sharpness, letting you pierce tough hides. Armor, meanwhile, carries several innate skills, and making a full set of a given type will give you several passive bonuses based on what armor it is. This allows for an absurd amount of customization, and it really feels great to not only find the perfect set for your playstyle, but then finally complete it after trying for hours to get that one Mantle. Also, the game has excellent Co-op multiplayer. You can join up with other hunters locally or over the internet, and then take down more powerful versions of the monsters as a team. There definitely are some bad eggs out there, but my experience has been great with others. As for story... It's probably the weakest part of the game. It essentially boils down to &#34;Welcome to the traveling caravan. Go hunt this for someone. Now go hunt this for someone. Now hunt this monster on the box of the game that we know simultaneously nothing and everything about. Now go hunt this for someone.&#34; Of course, this game really isn't about story, especially since at least half of the content is in Multiplayer. The graphics are fine for 3DS, and the music is solid. Ultimately, I would say the best way to play is to get it along with one or two friends and then work through solo and multiplayer at roughly the same rate. I definitely recommend this game to RPG fans and Action fans alike, as if you can get past the initial learning cliff, it's easily one of the best games for 3DS.	2015-08-18

This game is totally underrated & better than Terminator Genisys could dream of ever being imo. At it's core this is what Terminator is all about it's Techcom at war with Skynet which I like it's not trying to rehash what worked in the original movies it deals with General John Connor who has been leading Techcom & humans & machines have been at war for over 30 years. They've about got Skynet finished but John Connor has found out that Skynet is going to send an Infiltrator to 1984 which we all know who that is & that he's been sent back to kill Sarah Connor. John wants to stop it so he's going to lead an assault at Crystal Peak CO where 1 of Skynet's main bases are at & they're going blow it up however if a Terminator is sent back then John will send Kyle Reese back to 1984. I know The T 101's don't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger which I guess it was legal issues although Atari who made this game got use Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness in Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines as well as Terminator 3 Redemption. But I'm not going to cry about it & say \\\"H h h h how ca ca can you have T T T Terminator without Arnold Schwarzenegger?\\\\\" Cause this game has in the role of Kyle Reese, Justin Perry & Catherine Luna. It has ideas that I would've liked to seen had Terminator Salvation gotten sequels like defectors people turning on The Resistance. The characters of Alex & Gabriel Stone. Alex lost his Brother Gabriel cause John Connor pulled his men out of this battle & he blames him for his death only Gabriel is still alive & now he's with Skynet he joins his Brother which the ending where they're talking about what happens after the battle left things open for a follow up game but due tothe bad reviews & what not it didn't come to be. The game goes through 10 levels of battling different types of Terminators & droids as well there's HK battles & various objectives. The 1st level is leaving The Resistance Base that is under attack by Skynet you play as Kyle Reese. The 2nd level has you in an old Hotel & you have to protect Connor's Men you play as Kyle Reese. The 3rd level you get to play as Justin Perry & you help this guy rig the place to blow it up. The 4th level has you in The Federal Reserve. The 5th level has you in these sewers going to this factory & you battle this Skynet Loader. Level 5  you're back in the role of Kyle Reese you encounter a new type of enemy Human Hybrids. Then you go to this old Asylum. Level 7 you play as Catherine Luna & have to rescue Reese who has been captured by Alex Stone. Level 8 you battle an Infiltrator which is a fun fight. Level 9 you go to N O R A D where you fight your way into Skynet to get to The Time Displacement Chamber in the role of Perry. Level 10 you play as Reese where you have have to rig Skynet with C4 & get to The Time Displacement Chamber. Also this game has a great soundtrack it reminds me of Brad Fidel's score from T1. Plus the song Fear Factory uses at the end of the game is good. The tone of the game is dark. The look of the game is great. The graphics aren't anything great today but back then they were top of the line. I wish there would've been a follow up but I'm glad I have this game being a fan of this franchise I'm glad there's people that like the future war aspect of this franchise. Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in Terminator 1 & Terminator 2 however I'd wish he'd stay away from the series & we could have movies like this."	2015-08-18

Want some headphones that blow Beats out of the water? Grab these. I had an issue with the bluetooth volume button, it was my fault, I called Turtle Beach and was expecting a machine first thing.

Before Sunset Overdrive, before Ratchet and Clank, there was the purple dragon. This is practically half of the reason why Insomniac is as popular as they are today, the first of their true succession in the game developing industry, Spyro is right next to Crash Bandicoot in Playstation 1 mascots, and this is the game that started it all. Not only that, but this is one of the first games to bring the visualization of graphics from a further distance, where as before the view further ahead of the player would purposefully be blackened or given the effect of fog to hide the graphics. Also known as LOD (level of detail) this is one of the grandfathers of what we see now in every modern video game. A bold leap that helped launch off games we know and play today. This game is still a fun and fresh take on the 3D platformer genre, even if it was made back in 1998. Personally, I believe that this game is not recognized by enough people, and definitely deserves higher praise than it already had for its time. Not to mention, this game as well as the 3 other sequels of it had their music composed by Copeland, the drummer for the police.	2015-08-18

Once I recieved the product though, I found that it was cheaply made. The vertical stand depth is very shallow but it fits nice and tight. The fans have very low power, and aren't wuiet but aren't too loud. One major problem is the charging station. There is literally one way to fit them in, and the way that they're just standing up sucks. You will easily break your controller port or snap off the micro usb's. I definitely do not recommend this product to anyone looking. Your best bet is the SmAcc Vertical Stand with the charging dock. There are walla around the PS4 to better protect it from falling over and you charge your controllers not by the micro usb but the accesory side. Plus it has a better fan system.

Each game runs flawlessly, with no issues of lag or stuttering what so ever. Every game also looks absolutely gorgeous. Nothing was upscaled or aliased (with the exception of the original PS1 title) meaning that every model looks as smooth and clean as ever. This is one of the few HD collections in which the games themselves were actually IMPROVED, and not just ported and stretched to play on a larger screen. An absolutely outstanding collection of games, both literally, as well as technically.	2015-08-18

I constantly heard &#34;Hey Mommy, wanna play?&#34; to which my response usually was &#34;Only if you promise not to keep killing my character!!!&#34;  We spent IDK how many hours playing this, me collecting &#34;studs&#34; and him trying his best to kill me, LOL!  The point of the game  is not in fact to kill the other player, but to work together to collect all the &#34;studs&#34; and unlock all the characters and their vehicles but since the little guy is 8 I guess I have to cut him some slack ;-)  If you have a little LEGO lover then you probably need this game :-)	2015-08-18

The price for these however were a bit high, but I'm too lazy to actually hunt, so I ordered and I do not regret it.

At this point, I'd go so far as to call it my favorite RPG series, surpassing Final Fantasy and the Tales series, among others. When I saw that EO2 was getting a remake like the original did, I was thrilled but also curious just how well Atlus would do with it.<br /><br />I've never been a fan of dubbed games (say what you will, but that's my preference), and many games use the same recycled voice actors over and over. While that is true as well in EO2U (especially regarding the main character, Flavio, and Bertrand), the voice actress playing Chloe totally threw me for a loop. She's a perfect fit for the role, and I can't even imagine how the original Japanese VA would have been better. She makes me want to like dubs just a little bit more.<br /><br />In terms of the story, I was pleased to see that EO2U makes several references to the story portion of its predecessor, [[ASIN:B00DZIX39E EOU: The Millennium Girl]]. Both feature exploration teams from the Midgard Library, and the story makes other allusions to events in the previous story. However, it isn't necessary to have played EOU to understand the events of EO2U.<br /><br />The exploration system has been upgraded (quite significantly) in EO2U over both EO2 (the original version this one extends on) and even EOU. For the first time, maps now contain drawbridges, which work similarly to a combination of doors and shortcuts, but have their own quirks. For instance, they can be raised or lowered from one side only. The mapping system also provides many more colors for floor painting than before, similar to those available in [[ASIN:B00KVRK3EU Persona Q]]. Otherwise, most of the mapping features veterans of the series have come to know and love remain unchanged.<br /><br />Battles are mostly unchanged. There are a multitude of classes -- more than I've ever seen in a single EO game before. Many of them have a lot of overlap, like Survivalist and Dark Hunter. Even the Highlander class (the special class from EOU) is available with the installation of a DLC. Combat is turn-based team combat, where the player inputs commands for the entire team before beginning a round. The default character classes (in Story Mode) are: main character (Fafnir Knight), Flavio (Survivalist), Arianna (Sovereign), Chloe (War Magus), Bertrand (Protector). However, if the player wishes to change any of these, they can do so at any time with the exception of the main character, who must be a Fafnir Knight in Story Mode. My recommendation is to change as soon as a character joins your party. Changing classes will lower the character by 5 levels, but if the character is at level 1, they can change with no penalty.<br /><br />Over time I've come to really enjoy these characters more than the characters of EOU in fact. Even the NPCs are more charming in many ways than the NPCs of EOU. Whether helping Quona in the inn, chatting with Cass in the bar, or testing recipes and advertising for Regina in the restaurant, the characters feel more human than I remember them feeling in EOU, EOIV, or really most other RPGs.<br /><br />Regarding the difficulty of the game, Atlus has really toned it down for EO2U. What would previously be called &#34;Picnic&#34; is now more like Standard. The &#34;Picnic&#34; difficulty in this game is really very, very easy, and is recommended only for those very new to the series or RPGs at all. I can't comment on the Expert setting, as I have yet to try it.<br /><br />To wrap up, any fan of RPGs, of memorable characters, and of fantastical scenarios would do well to play EO2U. Having played (at least part) of all the games in the series, this one is clearly my favorite.(the special class from EOU) is available with the installation of a DLC.

Immersive and engaging.	pre-ordered this a year ago, it kept getting delayed. finally just canceled and then didn't buy it for a while after it came out. Very impressed with the game, worth the wait. The world is so detailed, I kicked this little miner's helmet that was on the ground and thought what amazing sense of detail and completion in the game. It feels real. There are some glitches, some characters (including batman) get stuck running in mid-air or inside walls. Overall, the story is good and love the Joker twist. I plaid the previous game and I like that it picks up the same story.<br /><br />I don't like that games are starting to go towards these &#34;season pass&#34; models. It would be one thing if games were cheaper and you are paying for expanded stories, but the games are going up in price, not down, and they expect you to keep paying for more. I won't be doing the season pass, but probably will buy the Batgirl story.	2015-08-18

There aren't a lot of reviews, but it works fine enough for me. It was cheap, came with one screen for the top of the 3DS, one for the bottom, and a little wipe. Didn't leave any gunk or residue, and was easy enough to apply (even though I botched it, there were little instruction tabs that I didn't pay attention too and they ended up getting a bit dirty. The top one didn't fit, but that's because I have a skin on my 3DS which interfered with applying it. All in all, I can't see any real difference between this one and the $8 ones, because there were no real problems with this one.	2015-08-18

It feels like the speakers are too close to my ears and the start to press on them. Mostly though, it feels fine, it's just after a while it can get a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />The headset (as far as I could tell) did not come with a windscreen so I needed to order one.<br /><br />The range on the transmitter/receiver could be a little better. It's fine when I'm in the same room as my playstation and most often in the next room, but if I go a couple rooms over it can start to lose signal.<br /><br />Now for the good:<br />The sound is fantastic!  This is my first surround sound headset so for me it is a real treat. Absolutely love the sound quality and he ability to tell where enemies are at by listening.<br /><br />Mic is pretty decent. Absolutely needed the windscreen however.<br /><br />I love the mic mute button and the separate audio controls for chat and game.<br /><br />Also I love not being tethered by wires.  This is absolutely a great headset int this price range, and I'm not about to go spending $300 on a headset.<br /><br />One thing that would have made this headset really cool was if I could detach one of the ear cups.  Often times my GF or somebody else is in the room and I want to be able to hear them as well.  It's an odd build request, but that probably would have made this my ideal headset. Slightly uncovering one ear never feels right.<br /><br />Otherwise, quality headset for the price :)	2015-08-18

The tracking on the lazer is a bit finicky. I'm used to have an immediate response from a slight movement (I'm a moba player), and honestly, after using it for a few hours, I miss my old mouse. Slight movements will either fail to track entirely, or track the wrong direction.<br /><br />The lightning is insufficient to cover the left buttons. As a result, they're mostly just a semi-transparent white. The product's picture is either photoshopped or I have a defective item, as the lighting is no where near that strength. The lights on the mouse are not at all pure, and seem to be picking colors at random. One half of the mouse will be red, another will be blue, creating a muddy-colored appearance.<br /><br />It came with only onboard drivers, which is fine I guess. The instruction manual that came with the unit reeks of poor translation. For example: &#34;Easy to get to the key, allow you to start attack efficiencely .&#34;  And yes, the poor grammar and typos are included. Another gem, &#34;Absolutely free driver, conquered without obstruction. side key can realize forward and back function.&#34;<br /><br />I noticed in the diagram, the left and right mouse buttons were reversed, and the buttons themselves are labeled on the mouse itself. I kid you not! One button is labeled &#34;double-click.&#34;<br /><br />I'm not an engineer, but I'm fairly certain the product features are almost entirely nonsense and lies.<br /><br />If you can get past all that, the mouse is acceptable for day to day use, but I'll be returning it as soon as I have the time.	2015-08-18

Even when compared to The Show 14/15.  I have played the newer on ps4 and there are some advantages. However, this review is simply for a baseball fan who only has a PS3. Get this game. It's pretty affordable and the gameplay is great. Great simulation of MLB with  physics, sounds, cut scenes, all-star break with home run derby. Sadly the online servers no longer run but if that's not important to you (like me) nothing is lost.<br /><br />What else can I say? Sony when compared to EA wins fairly easily in my opinion. And I like some of EA's games too. The amount of customization and simulation is really top notch. I consider this my favorite sports game ever. Baseball for Nintendo was good for its time. Jaleco, Bases Loaded was great too. RBI Baseball, MLB series in mid 2000s.  I highly recommend MLB the show 2013 for PS3.	2015-08-18

First off, Yes if you are buying this to use for the XboxOne (Like I did) you have to contact Polk so they can send you an adapter for the XboxOne controller.  It takes about two weeks to get, and they wont give you any update on it unless you call.  With that said, the headphones are freaking awesome.  I have an entry level set of bose on the ear headphones and a entry level set of klipsch in ear head phones and these blow both of those away.  Really great headphones for the price.

Setup wasn't difficult at all and didn't take too long. It took longest waiting on the built-in, optional YouTube app to update.<br /><br />Old Wii games work just fine, although the LEGO games look a little worse now. Their non-HD format used to be a little fuzzed out on my HD screen because I was using the standard red, white, and yellow cords. It looked fine. But now that the system is using a proper HDMI cord, the old non-HD Wii game resolution is much sharper... which ironically makes the blocky outlines much more noticeable.<br /><br />But Wii U games look fabulous. We have Jurassic World, and it's really nice. No more split screen! I'm enjoying having an entire TV screen to myself as Player 2 (using the old Wii remote) while my daughter hogs the Player 1 gamepad. She's welcome to the new set of control buttons. I'll stick with the old Wii remote buttons.	2015-08-18

Dungeon Travelers 2 is a Dungeon crawling RPG from Japanese game developer STING. Often known for their great games like Tears to Tiara 2, Yggdra Union, Evolution, and others, the developer has quite a solid reputation in Japan for delivering great games with excellent gameplay. This game is no exception.<br /><br />The Dungeon crawling in Dungeon Travelers 2 is some of the best you'll ever see on the vita let alone any other console, and the complex class system and customization will leave you tinkering and trying to find and create your preferred team for days. Another bright spot in the game is the dungeons themselves. Some dungeon crawlers tend to keep there maps quite simple which often leads to exploration being a drag (cough Mind Zero cough) which in turn makes the game become repetitive. Dungeon Crawlers 2 fortunately has some elaborate, well created mazes that make exploring maps fun rather than a mundane task. Enemies of course are anime style monster girls, with an abundant amount of them having amazing designs. The story is not anything too crazy or complex, but the characters and dialogue shared between both the MC (who at times can be a complete tool) and characters is great and interesting enough to want to see which direction the game and its story goes.<br /><br />The most controversial (and the one that may turn others away from it, understandably so) aspect of this title is the localization decision by Atlus USA to censor 4 cgs in the game. While these CGs were only slightly modified to be &#34;suitable for a M release&#34; the fact that there is censorship in the title is still something that is not acceptable. Admittedly, the censorship isn't anything too bad, and the CGs themselves were left in the game thankfully (take notes NISAmerica). As someone who hates censorship of any kind I still find it very unfortunate that such an excellent title will immediately be tossed aside by many because of the censorship since the game is so great.. While I completely understand anyone who doesn't support censorship, this game is too good to pass up, even if buying  it may deliver the wrong message that censorship is acceptable. I believe AtlusUSA has taken note of the response from the community of people who actually bought this game (if that means anything) and will hopefully see the message that censorship ruins a product . Again whether you pick up the title is up 2 you, but if you choose not to because of the censorship, its completely understandable. I myself was far too addicted after the demo to not play the game.<br /><br />  Regardless, if you can get past the fact that it has 4 small CGs censored, and decide to pick up this game, I can assure you that you will not regret it. DT2 is not only the best dungeon crawler on the vita, it may be one of the best titles released on it period. In a time where Vita releases seem to be dying down in the west, hidden gems like Dungeon Travelers 2 are a blessing to vita owners across the west.and anyone who doesn't support censorship, this game is too good to pass up, even if buying  it may deliver the wrong message that censorship is acceptable.

And I've been dealing with its problems for just as long. First of all, the way the headset comes together makes it very tight on your head. You may think this is fine, but wearing them for about an hour will start to cause discomfort because they are so tight. I have had to take them off for a few minutes occasionally because the area around my ears would start to hurt.<br /><br />Now on to the much more major problems. I am using them on PC by the way. I have had so many different problems over the years but I'll try and remember them all. One of the most common issues is that they constantly lose connection to the wireless transmitter. It will happen multiple times throughout the day that i'm using it. Every time it only disconnects for a second before reconnecting, but it often does it multiple times over the course of a few seconds before going back to normal. I am usually only 3 feet away from the transmitter when it does this too, so it is not an issue of being too far away. Now, sometimes there is an even more annoying way that it will lose and regain connection. Rather than the single or multiple quick &#34;beeps&#34; that it does when disconnecting, it will occasionally stop playing audio then a second later will start a long beep that lasts about 3-4 seconds then it will beep and make the sound it makes when it turns on. This doesn't happen as often as the previous issue, but it still is the second most common issue I have with the headset and happens sometimes once or twice a day.<br /><br />The least common, but most severe product breaking issues I have with the headset is that it will just stop working altogether. It may make some clicking sounds from the speakers, it may make a single tone beep sound that wont stop or it will just be completely silent. The lights on it will be dim when any of these issues occur. The worst part is that the logical solution is to turn it off and back on again. However when it has this problem, the button on the headset will not work. The usual way to turn off the headset is to hold the button on the headset down for a couple seconds, but when the light dims and it doesn't work like this, the button does not work and the headset will not turn off. The only solution is to either wait for the battery to drain or to take off the pad, unscrew a few screws and disconnect the battery then put it back together again. Once it loses power, it will turn on fine and work again for a few weeks before it does it again. And if you wait for the battery to drain, one of the few good things about this headset will be one of the worst. The battery can last hours meaning hours before you can use it again unless you want to disassemble the headset. This would not be so much of an issue if they included a reset button on the headset. But they didn't so its a major issue that completely ruins the product.<br /><br />To recap, The afterglow universal headset is uncomfortable, it has constant connection issues to the transmitter even if you're right in front of the transmitter, and occasionally just stops working mid use and wont be usable again until the battery drains. I do not recommend the afterglow headset and suggest finding another surround sound product that is more reliable and more comfortable.	2015-08-18

Great Product!<br /><br />I really liked the game. It was so fun and I personally think this was one of the greatest Call Of Duty game.<br /><br />The product was very special because I ordered it from a Third Party Seller on here. I received it used but it worked well and it in-fact came with the Revolution map pack!<br /><br />I would like to point out the fact that the game does Freeze at times...<br />which happens every hour or so... but it depends on how full your systems memory is, according to my testing.<br /><br />If you're looking to buy a Call Of Duty Game, but not spend a fortune, then buy this one... you should even consider buying it used, like me!<br /><br />Overall, it was a great buy, and I would definitely recommend the item for many others.<br /><br />Thanks!	2015-08-18

Prior to purchasing this game I had never actually played minecraft, I had heard of it and always figured it would be boring for someone like myself who doesn't have internet service for my console. While I imagine it is more fun to be able to play with other people online I still find it incredibly enjoyable to just play by myself and let my creative mind go crazy! I have mostly played on creative mode because I have enjoyed just wandering around and building whatever comes to mind, but survival mode is also very fun, I feel it plays kind of like a survival horror, you have to quickly build a shelter before dark and cautiously use your time and materials to improve your base and to expand and get more powerful weapons and armor. So this game is really perfect for all types of gamers as well as all ages, I am currently in a competition of sorts with my 2 younger cousins who are 10 and 16 and I am 22, so don't make the same mistake as I did and hesitate to buy this game its very fun and well worth the money.	2015-08-18

After growing frustrated with the interference from my old Turtle Beach headset, I decided rather than spend another $300 on top-of the line model, I'd give these a shot. I am so glad I did. With a few incredibly minor quibbles, this is without a doubt the best headset I've used on my PS4. First, it sounds great. I've used it to play games, listen to music, and both at the same time, and I've been very happy with the results; everything sounds rich without strain, tinny-ness, or fuzz. As for the simulated surround, it sounds at least as surround-y as my PX5. While I would always prefer to play through my actual surround system, family life means that is not always an option. These are immersive enough to really get into the game, but allow in just enough sound that I can hear when my wife is trying to tell me something or when our son wakes up and is making his way downstairs, and my wife has yet to complain about being able to hear the sound from the headphones while I'm playing. Despite the absence of a book mike, chat is clear, without echo or static, and my friends have said that my voice quality on their end has improved astronomically. On a couple of occasions (literally two) in the eight months I've had the headset, all sound has just vanished, but switching the headset off and then back on immediately fixed the issue.<br /><br />  With about eight feet between me and the television, wireless is essential, and I appreciate not having to be tethered to my controller. Connection is a breeze: plug in the USB adapter (more on that later), it automatically switches all sound to the headset, and you're good to go; so much better than all the cable swapping and output settings mess with the PX5. Done with the headset but want to keep playing? Switch it off and the sound will come through your regular speakers. I've never heard even the slightest crackle of wireless interference from where I sit on my couch (my consoles and Roku are wired, so maybe that helps), withconnection starting to break up after about forty feet or two walls, which ever comes first. I haven't tried using them wired to my Vita or phone.<br /><br />  Comfort is well above acceptable, but not quite into spectacular. I have a normal to large-ish head, and find it fits comfortably around it for two-three hours at a time (might be longer; I don't play much beyond 2-3 hrs, if that), and while I'd prefer a slightly more breathable ear cup material, I'm noticing uncomfortable levels of sweat. A lot of the reviews mention the cheap, plastic-y feel of the headset, and I will agree. So far, though, it's only a feel. I doubt these could handle much abuse, but I've traveled with them a couple of times and they have held up. They fold oddly (you'll want to fold the cups symmetrically into the headband, but that's not how it works) so they can be folded and charged at the same time, and the bag is nice for keeping the parts together, but not much protection. Speaking of parts, that USB dongle is both very small and very black. It looks pleasantly unobtrusive in the PS4 (I keep mine plugged in all the time) but it's only a matter of time before that thing disappears into the vortex of essential tiny parts. On the plus side, the blue flashy light on the adapter shuts off after a little while if the headphones are not connected. It would be great if the adapter slid into a slot on the headband or one of the earpieces for storage, but like the materials and the bag, they opted to keep a low price point and focus on sound quality. Ultimately, I think they made the right choice.<br /><br />Battery life is decent, 5-7 hours, and I don't know if they will run and charge at the same time. The battery level is indicated on the screen when it turns on, as are volume adjustments, muting status, etc, which is nice. The app is decent enough; I haven't played with the custom equalizer (don't feel I need to). I set the Destiny specific profile a while ago and have used it for everything. I'd encourage playing with the profiles a little, as I've found they sound better than the default. It's frustrating that the headset can only store one profile aside from default, and that you have to plug the headset into the PS4 to swap apps, so there's no real way to quickly compare profiles. The ability to transmit profiles wirelessly, or at least hold multiple profiles on the headset would be nice. Again, I suspect cost was the issue.<br /><br />So yeah, you should buy this if you're considering a headset, even if wireless isn't essential. It would be a great headset on its own, but for the price it's amazing.	2015-08-18

There is a ton of potential in this game. It definitely resonates with the 70s and 80s kids. At the present time there are a lot of bugs in the game. Ubisoft is aware and are working on the problems. The game itself uses a combination of RTS and FPS. So if you're a huge fan of those genres then by all means don't pass this up!! This game can be expanded upon with all of Hasbro Toys if Ubisoft was smart about this and start working on DLC content for upcoming releases. For example Transformers, more into Specialized Forces like Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes for Cobrah and GI Joe. or Even Skeletor for He-Man's adversary. The skies the limit when it comes to putting ideas on the board literally. I for one love this game and hope to see it grow into a long and prosperous game.	2015-08-18

US	12731723	R2MEVD2UXZ1S4	B00D2ZK2MQ	375459505	Dying Light	Video Games	5	1	1	N	Y	Familiar, yet fresh and a blast to play.	City environment – check, Zombies…or rather, Infected – check, Open world – check, co-op story – check, weapon crafting – check, developed by Techland – check; Must be time for another Dead Island game! No?! Techland passed on making the next Dead Island, this is Dying Light. The question is – can Techland make two very similar games and differentiate them enough to make each stand on their own?<br /><br />In Dying Light, the player is cast as an undercover operative, Kyle Crane, who is deployed on a mission in the fictional quarantined city of Harran. He gains the trust of the survivors that have sought refuge in a fortified high rise apartment complex while attempting to locate and recover a file that was stolen by a rogue political figure. The narrative aside, the basic game follows the same core concepts that are found in Dead Island. A focus on traversing an open environment, salvaging what valuables that can be found to build and augment make-shift weaponry while completing a variety of fetch, kill, deliver and defend style missions. Where this game pulls away from it’s Dead Island roots is with parkour styled free running mechanics for traversing the environment and a heavy focus on the day / night cycle.<br /><br />When in doubt, climb!<br />Taking cues from the Assassin’s Creed series, the player can be aimed at a nearby building or vehicle roof, canopy, boulder, utility pole or other similar object to climb out of reach of the majority of enemies or easily move from building tot building. Awnings, window frames, fixtures allow continued free running and climbing. Smaller obstacles, and even the infected, can be vaulted over and holes can be slid through. Later one can unlock the use of a grappling hook to accelerate climbing. I have found a useful oddity of the grappling hook is to be able to grapple the ground or objects close to it from a building to allow quick access to the ground without risking a substantial fall. For the most part the free running elements are well executed, although it can occasionally be cumbersome to aim when launching between distant handholds. The game excels at providing a good sense of scale; from the sheer size of the map to the details of the character attempting to maintain balance in windy high-altitude locations.<br /><br />Hack, slash, kick, shoot!<br />The majority of combat is melee using picks, cleavers, hammers, wrenches, knives, bats, swords and just about anything else that can be wielded. Don’t get too attached to any weapon you find though, they all have durability that deteriorates with use. Broken weapons can be repaired, but only a limited number of times. You will eventually have to discard or disassemble the weapon when it is exhausted. I like this characteristic as it adds to the overall feel of the game, that you are scavenging to maintain yourself. Firearms are available, but the typical player won’t find any until a significant way into the story. Guns don’t deteriorate over time any gun you find, could be used through the entire game without need to replace it, however you will need to locate ammunition. I have read of others noting a lack of ammunition in the game, while ammo is a commodity, I have not found it to be scarce. Many vendors sell ammo and anyone using a gun will have ammunition that can be scavenged from their corpse. I prioritize my firearms only for use against enemies also using guns. This avoids running out of ammo and attracting unnecessary attention from infected.<br /><br />Your mission…<br />Initially you are tasked with being a runner for the survivors, the lifeline between settlements and collector of supplies. During the day, the player focuses on claiming air drops of supplies to return to the survivors enclave, collecting resources for crafting and rescuing or escorting the random survivor. During the night, the player has to exercise caution as the standard infected have heightened senses, are more aggressive and can run and climb in pursuit of the player. Traps around the city can be utilized to distract or harm infected pursuers and UV lights are used to slow them. Missions can be carried out day or night although some require a certain time of day to complete. The player can be further hampered by dynamic wind, rain and fog. I find that Dying Light, while something of a more matured story than Dead Island, suffers from being rather obvious and doesn’t do much to make me actually care about people I’m helping or the tasks I’m completing. The missions, while they attempt to be varied, tend to lean far too much on fetch quests and the story campaign is rigidly linear. I find myself often times more interested in general exploration and advancing my skills over actually working on missions. The night cycle does provide a great sense of urgency and stark contrast to the concerns of the day.<br /><br />Keys to survival!<br />Free running, combat and general player abilities can be expanded or enhanced through levelling the survivor skills; Survival, Agility and Power. Skill points for Survival are earned through mission completion, Agility by climbing and Power by defeating enemies. There are 24/25 levels to earn for each of the 3 skill trees, each level earns one point to choose a new skill from the respective tree. Unfortunately, there is no need to be too picky on what skills to choose, since there will be just enough points to distribute to gain all the skills on each tree which leaves little variety between characters.<br /><br />Zombie apocalypse? Bring a friend!<br />You and up to 3 friends can cooperate in completing your mission in the same drop-in/out co-op that was available in Dead Island. The competitive multiplayer mode “Be the Zombie” I have found to just be tedious. When I first heard about the mode, I envisioned invading other players campaign and relentlessly stalking them over distances to throw a wrench into their progress at the worst possible moment. The reality is a single Special Infected vs Survivors game, where the special infected has to defend feeding grounds (nests) from the survivors while attempting to defeat them. While the powers of the special infected are fun to wield, the mode suffers as just didn’t find it interesting – at all. The necessity to focus on defense of nests I find silly – what reason would I have as an infected to care about anything but perusing my prey?<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />Dying Light follows, so very closely, the model established in Techland’s other make-shift weapon crafting, co-op, open-world Zombie outbreak slaughter fest, Dead Island. The addition of free running and emphasis on the day / night cycle are what make Dying Light truly stand out from Dead Island, and it is a welcome distinction. Overall I have found Dying Light an enjoyable experience and would recommend it to others with interest in the genre. I believe those that enjoyed Dead Island will find comfortable familiarity here, but also an interesting expansion on the of the concepts.	2015-08-18

After some researching, I came across this fightstick. For an afforadable price that matches the quality of more expensive fightsticks, it's a no brainer to pick this up.<br /><br />While I learned that using a fightstick is not suited to my tastes unfortunately, that doesn't excuse the fact of how great this one is. It feels comfortable on your lap, the buttons make a smacking noise when you hit them and feel good, the joystick uses a square portal but maneuvers very well, and a lot more that make it great. Switching over from PS3, PS4, and PC is really easy, which is nice. I would highly recommend this fighstick, but a warning to all pad players: if you are decent with a game pad, stick with it. A fighstick will be a steep learning curve for you, which caused me to shelf the fightstick.	2015-08-18

I just started playing this and am really enjoying it. I wanted a game that didn't require me to fight, kill, shoot, etc. and where I can just explore, this is the game. It's beautiful and the background music is very calming. I don't know if there is a goal or anything like that but so far its just exploring and gaining abilities like flying or 'shouting' to ring bells. I love playing Skyrim especially the exploring aspect but got really tired of having to fight dragons or bad guys & I especially disliked waiting for the upload of a new screen whenever I went somewhere. Journey doesn't do that, its very fluid and easy on they eyes. This package was a great deal it came with two other games and some bonus games, which I haven't checked out yet but I'm sure they are great.	2015-08-18

I've never been so unhappy with a purchase. Just sat at a loading screen for 7 minutes and then got disconnected from live so I couldn't play anyway. What I did play was awful. There was such a delay between steering commands and the vehicle actually turning, and i tried my racing wheel and two different controllers. The font on the screen was also very blocky so I couldn't read the small print. Basically you get a more realistic car game feel from twisted metal than from this waste of time and money.	2015-08-18

The definitive presentation of the anime epic classic. The movie itself is fantastic full of drama, action, and different themes. If you grew up with Robotech or simply like Mecha action, this is a must have movie. In addition, this is one of those movies that MUST BE OWNED by anime collectors. It's like owning The Godfather for the gangster movie collector. The only downside is there are NO SUBTITLES. I've seen this a million times so I know the script by heart, but a noob may have problems.<br />So what is the big deal? #1 hand drawn. Gorgeous animation with all the love transmited through the cells. Japan meant this one to be epic and it still holds up well to this day. One slight downside is the dust on the cells are visible in dark scenes. However, this gives it a certain charm like bluescreens on Superman The Movie. #2 Well written drama contrasted by awesome action with memorable characters. #3 a classic given the respect it deserves. Thanks to Harmony Gold; MACROSS is not well known here in America. Now is your chance to see the original tale in all it's glory.<br />The movie is censored for 1 second where there is a a cheap looking decapitation of a civilian during the final battle. After watching both versions of the film, I can tell you this new version is better because that scene was always a cheap gimmick. Another instance is a part where a female soldiers steps on the head of a fallen enemy soldier. This is &#34;blurred&#34; like the old Fist of the North Star mossaics for 1/2 a second, but the footage is still there. Barely even noticable.<br />The bluray also comes with a PS3 game that is alright. Yes it does play in a regular Bluray player.<br />One of my favorite movies ever up there with classics. This movie is a must own and I'm elated to finally have a proper copy of one of the best movies from Japan. Timeless, fantastic, and beautiful. Buy with confidence.	2015-08-18

The Bundle would be much better if it included 2 controllers instead of the type pad. So for example if this bundle included 2 controllers, the console, the game and the charger. Then maybe it would be worth it.	2015-08-18

US	41846103	R2GI52CMGNZC1O	B00E3667XQ	43786483	NVIDIA Shield Portable Starter Pack	Video Games	5	4	4	N	Y	Nvidia Shield Portable is the future of all Handheld Gaming Systems	Overview:  The Nvidia Shield has a high-quality build with comfortable responsive buttons, and a sharp and bright touch screen. Expandable storage and HDMI output sweeten the pot. Sound quality through the speakers is excellent, and gaming performance is incredible, especially if you are looking for the perfect emulator that play NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, Gameboy, Gameboy DS, Nintendo64, PSX, PSP, Dreamcast, Gamecube and many many more console systems games flawlessly!<br /><br />Pros:<br />•  Excellent build quality.<br />•  Comfortable gamepad with powerful Gamepad Mapper feature.<br />•  Download Emulators from the play store to flawlessly play 1000's and 1000's of old console games.<br />•  Very fast for an Android device (it is a full tablet as well as a gaming device).<br />•  Lots of connection and storage options (microSD slot that can read up to 64gig and a micro USB port you can connect a HD to + a mini HDMI port).<br />•  It can stream games from a locally networked PC to the Shield Portable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />•  Battery takes a long time to charge and only lasts around 4-5 hours.<br />•  Clam Shell design makes using the touch screen a bit of a pain to use comfortably.<br /><br />Final Analysis:  Nvidia has spared no expense on build quality, using thick matte, glossy, and metallic plastic on the chassis and rubberized grips underneath. The 5-inch 720p IPS touchscreen display is one of the best I’ve seen on a portable, producing stunningly vibrant colors, sharp detail, and wide viewing angles.  The Shield's heft is due, in large part, to its full sized controls. While other handhelds use scaled down buttons and thumbsticks, the Shield affords players the same suite and size of controls you can find on a console controller. The thumbsticks have the same surface area and range of motion as the DualShock 3 or Xbox 360, while the action buttons, d-pad, and triggers are springy and responsive. The system has a pair of stereo speakers that deliver surprisingly loud and tonally rich audio, though in many on-the-go cases, owners are more likely to use headphones.  This is the most powerful Android handheld console on the market today and is in my opinion the future of all Handheld Gaming Systems.  At $200.00 out of the box, I believe this is well worth the price.<br /><br />Final Note:  I don't get paid to review products and bought this device with my personal finances.  I hope this review is helpful and would be glad to answer any questions regarding my experience with this or any other produces I have purchased on Amazon.gly loud and tonally rich audio, though in many on-the-go cases, owners are more likely to use headphones.

The game arrived in a soft CD case with no instructions or liner notes at all. Inside the case was a white label with the key code on it. The liner does not resemble any UBISOFT game I've purchased before. The notes were printed on the cd, probably with a HP computer. The game began freezing after the second level and the Seller refused to refund or make any adjustments, so he knows what he's selling.<br />The photo above is NOT what you receive.	2015-08-18

Basically, the mic is VERY sensitive. I had to get a replacement because of this. But the one I have now works great!	2015-08-18
