The first 4 chapters start off great but after that I must say that I stopped playing for a few months. The fighting style is interesting and the characters are good but the story absolutely kills this game for me. I won't write any spoilers here but if you just do a quick search online and find out why I'm saying this. I'm surprised that the reviews are so good for this game because of of it. I belong to a JRPG community online and after hitting chapter 5 I started doing some reading. A good amount of people ended up just giving up on the game. Not because of the difficulty, but because of the second half of the game. I have my characters at max level and a good amount of their jobs maxed out as well and am currently on chapter 8. I feel like I should finish it because I bought it but its going to be very reluctantly.	2015-08-23

It's starts off pretty scary but eventually leads into this RE5 type of shooter where all the enemies are shooting guns and just have red glowing eyes like they're just upset instead of demons or something actually acary.<br />The game is tough/challenging but it's just not the true horror genre it was cracked up to be. It's pretty much an action 3rd person shooter.<br />Not terrible but not scary or amazing by any means.	2015-08-23

Excellent service from my seller, complete and in perfect condition, and received in two days!<br />The original Xbox is still an amazing system, long after it's discontinuation, with many exclusive games never found anywhere else. The first limited edition version being a clear green Halo special edition, which some say, was built with more durable elements than the mass produced black version. Common failure point on the original Xbox is the DVD drive, which is repairable both cheaply and fairly easily. Modding of the original Xbox is also common as it is very easy to do and has support of many emulators, making it a perfect candidate for MAME cabinet hardware or for an all in one retro console. Under a half million Halo editions were built, so finding a good operating one complete in the original box is a retro collectors dream find.	2015-08-23

Well the answer is YES! The reasons are very simple from a gaming and entertainment stand point. Here are some things about the PS4<br /><br />1. The PS4 (basic system without camera) Comes with one Controller with charging cable (Micro USB cord so if you lose it you can just use your phone cord if you have android phone) Manuals on how to setup system. And A stock headset (cheap but works) and all power cords for system.<br /><br />2. Games- right now PS4 has lot's of games out right now that each home user has a game type you each can enjoy.  Also you can rent games through the PS Now program like old PS3 games and so on. &#34;But wait can't I just play my PS3 games o. The system? &#34; No No No you will have to buy them again on the PS4 and also your content will not transfer over<br /><br />3. Recording- now not a lot of people do this but if you do the PS4 had built in recording features so that the Twitch/YouTube peeps can integrate their game play with the system.<br /><br />4- What about movies and stuff and Netflix?<br />Yes you can still use that stuff and much more the entertainment package for the PS4 is quite large from Netflix to Vudu to youtube to Hulu they have an App for it.<br /><br />All in all yes get a PS4.	2015-08-23

I never write reviews but I felt this game needs one seeing as no one reviewed it yet.<br />LBX is Gundam meets Pokemon or as close to that as you can get. You play as a 13 year old boy who is trying to become the best LBX player. LBX are small robots people use for battles.<br />The battles take place in real time in a boxed in landscape. Landscapes vary from volcanic, wooded, towns, docks, factories, arctic, ect. You can customize your robot with thousands of combinations from heads, legs, body, both arms, CPU, batteries, aux units, chips, the list goes on and on. Various types of swords, shields, hammers, axes, daggers, one handed guns, rifles, rocket launchers, pole arms, fist weapons, ect are what you do combat with. You can take battle items into a duel with you as well. These range from grenades, mines, healing items, stat protection, defense speed and attack buffs and many others. I'm about 16 hours in and am loving it. You can follow the main story or go off completing quests or just run around battling people in the streets, at school, in arcades, and many other places. I have yet to play any multiplayer so I can't comment on it. I do know I am enjoying every minute of this game. If you enjoy RPGs and Pokemon but want a faster paced battle system in real time, I think you'll like this game a lot. Well worth the price in my opinion.	2015-08-23

There's not much story, so it feels like playing a side quest. If you're a die hard Ratchet & Clank fan I strongly encourage you to play.

Overall they fit nice, and sound good.  My biggest complaint though is that these automatically turn on with your xbox. Problem with this is if you have the mic plugged in then everyone can hear what you are saying. Better functionality would be for them to be off until the power button on them is pressed to turn them on. Hopefully they fix this with a future firmware update, or at least give you an option to set it up like this. Right now we just keep the mic unplugged until we are ready to use them.  Its also too bad for the price of these that they don't include bluetooth, and that you have to use a cable on a &#34;wireless&#34; headset to get phone functionality, that would have made these near perfect had that been included.	2015-08-23

I do enjoy how 343 has combined 4 games in 1, the Menu, for example, highlights how easy it is to explore the features it offers. However, Multiplayer Matchmaking could be better. For one you can't quite the Lobby once the teams are made. But what if none of the three game-types offered interest you? You should be allowed to leave. Secondly, it sucks the game does not continue with the team you played previously, thus necessitating you to re-start matchmaking. Thirdly, there are few game-types for the amount of Halo's available. A Big Team Battle should be available for each halo, for example, as each game has it's perks. All in all, the fun thins out very fast from having to re-start matchmaking over and over again, with a limited amount of maps and games for each individual Halo. In the end, it was well worth it, as playing  the original Halo online was priceless. I am nervous about Halo 5, as the expectations of Halo MCC were high and the delivery was borderline.	2015-08-23

Our heroes are caught in between a prison break of a dangerous criminal and have to decide what's the right thing to do?

Here there will be these worm puzzles that can be both difficult and annoying, but with trial and error anyone can figure them out. There's also a Battle Arena area that comes in handy for weapons upgrades. If you're a Ratchet & Clank fan than you have to check out this game.	2015-08-23

It glows in the dark, so I can switch off all the lights and plays games in a dark room.  But you know that already.  So I am gonna tell you about my experience with the customer service and warranty.<br /><br />I think the warranty period  for this controller is 90 days or something.  (Most game controllers and mice have  three to six month warranty.)  I think I bought this controller in May 2014, and its A-button broke in November 2014.  The internal spring of the A-button had lost its elasticity.  When I pressed the A-button, it would stay down and not bounce back up promptly.  That is a very common problem with the A-button because it is the one that is repeatedly pressed and abused the most.  So I called up the manufacturer, knowing that the warranty period had expired.  I had to call a few times because no one picked up the phone during the first few calls.  When I finally got to speak to a customer service rep, he told me not to worry about the warranty.  He told me to send the controller back, and they would send me a new one when they received the broken one.  I did not have to include the original box or packaging, a printout of the receipt or invoice, or anything else that originally came with the controller.  I just had to put the broken controller in an envelop and send it back.  I sent it back in its original packaging with all the original materials and a printout of my receipt from Amazon.  Then they send a new one to me within a week.  (P.S. Their office is located near where I live.)	2015-08-23

There's a little give to the buttons, but everything feels spectacular and solid in the hand. It works as expected, and I've been using this as my main remote on my Nvidia Shield TV even though I'm a gamer - it's so convenient, it replaced the gamepad in a heartbeat. The coolest bit? Sue me, but it's the glowing microphone button. It just looks so damn cool. Being able to plug your headphones into the bottom is a close second.<br /><br />I do have a few minor gripes with the controller. None of them bother me too much, but your mileage may vary.<br />1. Plastic parts get micro scratches easily, as does all plastic<br />2. I can't confidently grip this remote as I'm watching stuff on my TV, since the volume control is touch sensitive. Grip it too hard and your volume will start changing.<br />3. When I plug in my headphones to the port, it comes out relatively easily. There's no &#34;click&#34; or light lock to keep it in there.<br />4. No dedicated media control buttons. The layout is nice and as an artist who can appreciate simplicity and design, I get why they omitted it. But still, having forward/backward/play buttons would be much more convenient. Fast-forward and rewind is easily one of the biggest inconveniences on Android TV. The difference between using a touch screen to drag a slider vs holding a button to FF (or worse, select 4x speed like on DVD)players) is night and day.<br /><br />Overall it's a solid remote. The complains I have are mostly informative, so you know exactly what you're getting into. My experience with it has been great, and with the $25 promotion I would say it's a necessity to complement your Shield TV.	2015-08-23

The game is captivating and always changing as it jumps along your story line throughout play.  Paying $16 for this was a decent price and I'm OK with that, but what makes this 5 stars for me is that it's the most vivid, graphically stunning PS3 game I've ever played.  May sound exaggerated, but there are scenes where you watch it and wonder if you magically just got a PS4.  This game is coming out for PS4, but doesn't need to b/c the graphics are already comparable.  The level of detail in faces & environments will have you wanting more and shaking your head at some moments when you wonder how this game is so beautiful!<br /><br />If you can rent this game instead, do it, but keep in mind that you can always play this again and take a different story line based on your in-game decisions.  Definitely a replayable game, and stunningly beautiful.	2015-08-23

Graphics id give a 7.5 of 10.<br /><br />Cons: like most other games there was a lack of importance to what you were doing, fedi campaign was much slower than the latter(in my opinion) maps were ok at best, Would have liked enviromental destrucability incorporated.<br /><br />Im a huge fan of the series and i highly recommend this game if you are to.

Literally the worst screen protector I have ever used on any portable gaming system since I started using them for every system back when the Game Boy Advance came out. I blindly bought this due to the fact that it has good ratings, no idea how it got them, literally every screen protector made by every legitimate and bogus company has worked better than this, guaranteed no bubbles? Can I get my money back? Because there are 30-40 tiny bubbles (impossible to avoid due to how the directions themselves -seem- to attempt to direct you to put the protector on) all over the protectors. Very disappointed at the high cost of this protector and the very low quality of the product. If they charged 2$ for this it would be too much. DO NOT BUY!!!	2015-08-23
US	25099208	R7Z042UL9J8OO	B00DHF39HQ	32807762	The Elder Scrolls Online	Video Games	3	3	6	N	N	Elder Scrolls Fan Fiction in MMO form	I'm going to start off by saying that this is by no means a bad game; in fact, it's quite excellent for an MMO and as taken at face value. Where it goes wrong, I feel, is the Elder Scrolls part of it.  Notice that the game is made by Zenimax and not Bethesa Game Studios (Bethseda Softworks own both). They did as good of a job as they could, but it comes off almost as a fan fiction rendering of the series. I can't help but think while playing it that there's no way that this game will be considered part of the Elder Scrolls canon when they make the next single player ES RPG. Keep in mind while reading my review, that a lot of what I'm talking about was *not* explained in-game and that I figured out a lot of this based upon googling and just playing. It made the experience a little more frustrating than it had to be.  I started as a Nord in the Ebonheart Pact. Just like the other games, you have a choice of the various races (except Imperial class which you have to unlock) and you have a choice between the three alliances. The latter choice will set you in one world until you hit level 50 (in my case, so far, I have access to Dark Elf settlements, argonian areas, and nord areas as well as bits of skyrim here and there) and after that you have to clear the other two in order to complete the game. Once you hit level 10 you have access to the PvP section in Cyrodil, which I haven't much explored yet, but it seems you can become Emperor if you have the highest score on the winning team, which opens up a unique emperor skill tree. The premise, which is not intuitive at all, has you begin in ColdHarbour, the realm of the Daedric prince, Molag Baal. You learn that you are dead, that your soul removed was from your body, and that your goal, effectively, is to stop Molag Baal from breaking through into this world and to get your soul back. Back in Nirn, 1,000 years before the events of Skyrim, there is civil war brewing and the races are forming alliances that are competing for the throne as well as for control over all Tamriel.  THE GOOD: - It's addicting. Though my &#34;bad&#34; section seems to override the good, the only reason for that is because they chose to call this an Elder Scrolls game when they could have easily used the same exact system to create another MMO. It gets better as you play it.  - The main storyline, thus far (I'm at lvl 15), is pretty good. Not up to par with the previous titles but very good for the MMO genre. The main story, the guild storylines, and the overarching war lines are all good. It's the billions of random other ones that are a bit boring and come off pointless. I don't really care about most of the characters because they don't have any distinguishing characteristics or quirks that would make them interesting; all are cookie-cutter versions of each other and each race is a bit of a caricature. Despite that, still enjoyable overall.  - I like that the best way to level up is to complete quests. It just works well for this game.  - The multi-player integration is great too. I thought I'd hate it, but it was a bit fun to pair up with randoms for multiple person dungeons. It can be annoying at times when another player or players beat the boss just as you get there. You get credit for beating the boss without even throwing a punch. When that happens you have to be careful because sometimes when picking up whatever it is you needed from the boss, it respawns and starts hitting you. Hope they fix that. There are annoying sorts - children playing loud music, squeaky mics, domestic disputes - but you can always just leave the chat channel or the chat area. It's pretty much impossible for someone to ruin the experience for you, which is a nice touch.  THE BAD: -It's technically not free. You have to pay for a playstation plus subscription. I just paid for 3 months for $18, and given that, you get game discounts and free game downloads; it's really not that bad price-wise, but it is important to state thatdespite removing their subscription fee, it's still not free to play on consoles.  - The game is all in real time, so there is no saving or pausing. The no pausing drives me crazy because even when you're looking at your inventory or map, things/people can hurt and kill you. When you die, you have a choice to go to the nearest wayshrine or respawn using a full soul gem corresponding to your level. Also, the game logs you out after 20 minutes of inactivity.  - As mentioned, the fast travel system needs a bit of work. It's not intuitive and the PvP and PvE are not mutually compatible for fast travel, which is understandable, but there is no real instruction on how to travel to Cyrodil once you hit level 10 and it's a bit tricky to get back to the PvE engine from Cyrodil (I had to google this and look at multiple places before I figured it out).  - The leveling system, though I've heard that they've fix a few issues, is still ridiculous. What I dislike most about it is that there is no way really to get ahead with super cool armor or a cool rare weapon - every object is given a 'level' and you cannot use, equip, eat or drink anything that is above your level. I've gone ahead and completed quests that were way out of my skill range, received the rewards, only to just drop them off at the bank for storage until I hit that level. This also gives us no incentive to keep or store lower-ranked objects no matter what they are. I just destroy the objects below my ranking because there's no point.  - I feel no incentive to learn enchanting as you can easily find enchanted objects throughout the world. All the other skills such as provisioning, alchemy, woodwork, blacksmithing, leatherwork, etc are pretty boring, unnecessarily complicated, and it seems like everything is made at a much lower level than I'm at (since each of these traits have their own levels/skill trees). It makes it feel pointless, but then again, I haven't really been spending my precious skill points on any of these skills because as a non-subscriber, you don't get them very often.  - Every time you level up, complete a major quest, or collect 3 skyshards you get 1 skill point to spend. Those skills points can be used to purchase special moves, 'ultimate' abilities, or passive traits. There are a ton of skill trees, but when you don't have a subscription it takes a bit longer to level up, which makes it feel incredible slow and monotonous at times. When purchasing special moves for a weapon type (they have bow (all have infinity arrows), 1 hand/shield, dual wielding, two handed, and staff), you assign each move to a button on your controller. The fighting system is a little boring at times because you cannot do what i like to do, which is sneak around and pick people off, not only because of the system but because it seems like enemies respawn in the exact area within a minute (sometimes out of thin air which is annoying). As a lvl 15, I've unlocked weapon swapping but i haven't really utilized this yet.  - Graphics are cartoonish and disappointing in the context of next-gen tech.   - Both jumping and interacting are through the X button, meaning that if there is an interactable object in front of you, you will interact with the object instead of jumping. This was irritating when my character would get stuck between solid objects and I couldn't jump away because there was a damn crate in front of me.   - One of my favorite things about the ES games was that everything was interactable and the stories/characterization were always consistent. In this game, they've simplified its interactiveness. An example would be that you can only read one book from each bookshelf, each container if not empty has one random item in it, potions are just simply marked &#34;alchemy bottle&#34; or &#34;drink,&#34; you cannot see the stats for the weapons/armor laying around the world  without picking it up, and most items/dead people are non-interactable. There is literally no way to tell which items you can pick up or not unless you get close to them. As for the inconsistent characterizations/stories, it feels like a fanfiction. Playing in Ebonheart pact, I've noticed they've just pretty much thrown in flora/fauna from other games haphazardly. There is scathcrow all over the place (instead of just being near the volcanic/dark elf areas), there are the large Telvanni mushrooms all over the place (even though the lore states that they're special to that house of dark elves), every Argonian has a hypenated name, and every Nord is a boisterous drunk. Sounds a bit nitpicky,I know, but its those attention to details that really made me fall in love with the previous titles.  OVERALL:  NOT A BAD GAME. It is enjoyable for what it is and the ES title is what is going to get people to buy it. If you are an MMO fan, you will love this. If you are an Elder Scrolls fan, it could go either way. I play video games for storyline and immersion, so my gripes will not be the same as other people's gripes. I'd suggest people at least try it. I didn't like it at all at first, but as I'm cheap, I kept on playing and it sort of grew on me.	2015-08-23

This charging solution was the only one on the market that actually looked somewhat nice (and much more presentable than having USB cables hanging off the front of the PS4).  Inserting the DS4 into the cradle is hit or miss, and it usually takes me a good minute or two to get one seated correctly if the lighting is dim (which I can live with).  Other than that, it looks nice and works perfectly on 120V US power as shipped.  EDIT: just realized that a DS4 will actually drop itself gently onto the charger's connector when placed in the cradle, which seems to work much better than trying to line up the connectors and pushing the controller into place.	2015-08-23

The brake pedal doesn't work. The rubber grips began to wear away. There was a rattling noise until 30 seconds ago, and the flappy paddles don't act like gear shifters, they are the analog controls. It's annoying and there are no games that have the correct controls for the flappy paddles to be gear shifters. The great thing about the brake pedal is that I can use it as a clutch. Also I just discovered that the gear for the brake pedal to work broke completely so the brakes don't work. But on the plus side it works pretty much flawlessly. I like it and I use it all the time on my PS2.	2015-08-23

In 2015 I would hope we would no longer need to point a remote directly at a console for it to function, but I guess Microsoft disagrees.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Looks nice<br />* Functions<br />* Volume controls work with TV, which is nice<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />* IR, not bluetooth/wireles. In my case, while I can see the xbone there is a table in front of it that often blocks this remote from functioning half the time.<br />* Very heavy - I'd guess 3x as heavy as the fire stick remote<br />* Very thick - Again, easily 3x as thick as the fire stick remote<br /><br />Conclusion: For an extra ~$10, get a fire stick. Don't bother with this thing.	2015-08-23

I've been playing for 2 weeks now, and just got to 98% on Arkham Knight, which was a fun game even if I disliked the game's ending .I bought this bundle because I got it on a day where Amazon gave me $20 in credit on top of me using a bunch of saved up bonus points making it almost free. Really, the only reason I was getting a PS4 was to play Fallout 4 and Star Wars Battlefront, but they don't come out till November. The deal made me bite early. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Close to the first thing I did was swap out the hard drive for a SSHD 1 TB drive as I knew the space on 500 GB would run out fast (trust me, Arkham Knight itself, even playing off a disk, requires a 50 GB install - so, 8 games and the drive would be full). The swap out was so painless and easy I couldn't believe it. granted, I have some experience with such things, but honestly, it was so easy anyone could do it.<br /><br />The drive came 1 day after the system, and I couldn't resist, so I spent the first day playing games on the stock hard drive. There were updates that needed installed, and then there were my save files. Transferring these to the new hard drive was effortless as well. On a USB 3.0 thumbstick (128 GB) it took me 35 minutes to copy 75 GB off the stock drive, and then after the new drive was installed and initialized, about 45 minutes to copy it back onto the system. I did it in between mowing the lawn and doing laundry and it was click and forget it for each step. set up the process, go mow the lawn, come back and it was done. perfect.	2015-08-23

The graphics are pretty nice and the animations are far from bad, too, but after awhile the gameplay gets repetitive. The story is bare-bones, the puzzles can hardly be called such, and it's difficult to play even an entire level before getting bored.

I'm a big fan of giant robot anime and a love Saturn games that combine 2D and 3D. This game is a perfect blend. While your ship/robot is 2D sprites the enemies and level are in 3D. There's horrible draw-in but I don't mind a bit because there's a super helpful radar, perfectly designed levels, and absolutely gorgeous high-speed graphics.<br /><br />The game has it's main menu in English but the controls and mission briefings are in Japanese. This isn't a problem because the objectives are straightforward and the controls can be figured out in a minute or three.<br /><br />I've played a lot of games like this over the years (robot war-machines fighting in cities) but this is the most anime-like of any of them, with the best controls, the best graphics, and the most fun gameplay by far.<br /><br />If you love Saturn action games and especially if you love giant robot anime you are going to love this game. It is worth the high price.	2015-08-23

LEGO Marvel fit the bill, and was just what the doctor ordered.<br /><br />Combat -- Well, the type of combat really hinges on who you're playing as. Guys like Iron Man (easily my favorite hero to play with in the game) are better suited to use ranged attacks. However, if you're playing as Hulk or Thing, melee combat is pretty much your only option. If I can be honest, the combat isn't really fun, regardless of who you're playing as. It's a LEGO game, so I wasn't expecting much anyway. As for dodging or blocking incoming attacks; again, it depends on who you're playing as. If you're Captain America, you can use your shield to send projectiles flying back at the enemy. There's not a button dedicated to dodging, so if you're not playing as a character that has a shield, you'll be S.O.L. in some cases. Not to worry though, I pretty much went through the entire game without dying. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure you -can- die...<br /><br />Weaponry -- I know I sound like a broken record, but it depends on which character you're playing as. I'm not super familiar with the Marvel characters, so I'm not going to attempt to name all of these guys and their powers. If you're a Marvel fan, I'm pretty sure they have the same powers that they have in the comic books and movies. Captain America has his shield, Thor has his hammer, Storm uses her tornado, etc. I didn't play as too many different characters, so I only know of a couple of guys that can use the environment as a weapon, and that would be Hulk and Thing. I wish more characters could make use of the environment, such as the gameplay in Ultimate Alliance II. Oh my, I can't believe I just said something good about that game. I must not be feeling well...<br /><br />Enemies -- None of the enemies are difficult, and they're not very diverse. There are a few that use projectiles, but most of them just run at you and hit you. The heck with it, I'm just going to come out and say it. You can probably beat most of the enemies with your eyes closed. I found most of the boss battles to be pretty lame, except for the one against my favorite villain :-) Alright, here's how most of the boss battles go:<br />1) Destroy a fixture of LEGOs.<br />2) Use the scattered LEGOs to build a new LEGO fixture.<br />3) Use said fixture of LEGOs as a weapon against the boss, and he'll lose 1 heart of health.<br />4) Repeat steps 1-3 until you deplete all of their hearts.<br />This process is actually more lame than it sounds...<br /><br />Miscellaneous -- If you decide to play through the story mode and skip all of side-missions, it's probably a 15 hour game, at the most. There are a ton of side-missions, but I can't really speak to how much fun they are, because I only completed 2 of them. After completing a level, you'll automatically unlock free-play, which means you can replay the level and use any of the unlocked characters. Although this game is lacking in a lot of areas, it excels in providing challenging puzzles. I hate to admit this, but I relied on YouTube to aid me in a couple of puzzles, so beware. The main hub is in NYC, and I enjoyed driving around town, trolling some of the LEGO residents :-) I chose to only spend 15 hours on it, but there's definitely at least 50 hours of gameplay awaiting anyone that's interested.<br /><br />LEGO Marvel was just a filler game for me, and it served its purpose. I was very impressed with how complex some of the puzzles were, but the game as a whole was kind of meh at times (especially when I was unable to play as Iron Man). Although LEGO Marvel wasn't a great game, it was the perfect game to followup a brutal 88 hour slugfest like Bloodborne. I needed something light and vanilla, and that combination rarely results in 5 star game, so I think 3 stars is appropriate. Mad Max; you're up next!them just run at you and hit you.

Ever since I received it, there has been a steady flow of new content released which keeps it &#34;fresh&#34; (&#34;Stay fresh!&#34;). Everything in the game is a clever sea related word play. The story and premise is clever and original. Gameplay is smooth and fairly easy to learn but difficult to master, which makes it easy to keep interest. Matches are quick, so you don't have to commit an hour just to play a match - 3 minutes for standard play, 5 minutes or less on the more competitive ranked play. Matchmaking ensures you aren't playing against people way above your skill level, and doesn't let it get boring as you get better by giving you harder opponents as you advance. The bright colors are fun and make it interesting for kids/spouses.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish there was local multiplayer so my wife could play on my team. Instead we just take turns every other match.<br />There is occasional lag which provides an unexpected death, but that's forgivable every once in a while.<br /><br />Overall, while this is a shooter game, it doesn't feel that way. It feels more like a friendly game of paintball or laser tag. It's family friendly and ridiculously fun.	2015-08-23

The game can get frustrating and requires you to rebeat older levels but the great part is they always regenerate so youll get a different play through, and even though you got up to 20 sumthing zones the game will never end as you.

I purchased this system back in 2006 for use with my Playstation Portable. I found this unit at a local Best Buy for a total of $50.00 and I was pretty impressed.

But I'll be honest, these little cheap Chinese speakers... Are pure Gold when it comes to amazing audio... If you can find this little system today, you better buy them, I've abused the hell out this little speaker system for nearly 8 years and they still work... In fact they still sound incredible even in comparison to to my amazing Audio Engine A2+'s and my A5+'s this company may have disappeared but they left behind a legacy to those who happened to luckily stumble upon them.

(Sometimes mom and dad pays and sometimes they pay.)<br /><br />As far as ear buds what I've purchased about 10x is Panasonics cheap little $6 dollar product.  Here's an ASIN -- B003EM6AOG -- they come in a bunch of colors and price can vary a little with color. We haven't discovered any quality difference with the different colors.  They are cheap and good enough to enjoy most music and gaming sounds.<br /><br />WHAT I was looking for here is the Headset equivalent.  Something to be used for Skyping in particular as that seems to be the thing these days. My kids can't game without chatting with friends. This headset is not good enough though for this price.<br /><br />WHAT I FOUND<br />-- plug and play works fine.  No problem using them.<br />-- sound quality was not even $6 dollar good.<br />-- uncomfortable to wear.  With only 1 ear pad you would think comfort would be easy to accomplish. Not so. Granted, daughter child and I have big heads.  If you have a big head, avoid.<br />-- cord feels cheap.  Of course it doesn't really matter as long as the cord holds up, but it feels cheap.<br />-- I like the L-shaped plug<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />Too pricey for you get.

I may just be a different kind of fan of video game genre or may have totally missed the mark on this one and souley purchased this because bungie was attached to the name but this game is NOTHING compared to ANY of the Halo franchise games. There is no storyline, or great video clips to get you excited about the next mission. It is the same brainless mission over and over again and when you do see others playing alongside you, no one is willing to join your party, play with you and half the missions are so difficult you get lost in it all. There are some areas that require a higher level to enter and actually defeat the opponents but the game never specifies or explains any of this.<br /><br />I personally am a fan of halo, mass effect, tomb raider, assassins creed, and uncharted... Not one of these games are even similar to this one. I absolutely hated every mission and felt empty after completing any quest.<br /><br />If you also were looking for games I mentioned.. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game at all cost. I really did try to like this game. I would leave it for days,weeks, and even a month and came back to play hoping it was just my mood at the time, but I ended up not even finishing or caring.	2015-08-23

Good story (though the ending does get kinda weird).  A lot of fun, many different ways to clear each situation. Some of the QTEs can be a bit annoying after multiple fails and does break the fluidity of the story a bit. Overall a great game that deserves it's praise. I did however experience a bug towards the end where a certain action did not happen and I was stuck. Luckily with the help of google I was able to glitch( READ NOT CHEAT) my way through it which allowed me to continue (search youtube for Ps3 tomb raider bug).	2015-08-23

If you play station is like mine, it stays dusty. This product is not put together. When you get it you will need to assemble the screen and the two plastic pieces. Make sure you look at the sides as they are different. One side of the screen and plastic is diagonal and the other side is straight.  It was a little hard to get the pieces together. One they are together and you are going to put them on the machine you will need to look at the sides as the diagonal side goes to the front.  The instructions are not that great but it's easy to figure out. It also comes with port covers so if you are using a USB port you can cover it so dust stays out. So far it looks like it might work. And if the screens become too dusty they give you two more screens as replacements.	2015-08-23

Multiplayer is terrible--TERRIBLE!!! Before I start this review I have 10+ Years of computer networking experience, I have already configured my router to every possible combination, I.E port forwarding, NAT open, DMZ ETC!!! So it is NOT my network connection. Also all my other multiplayer games work flawlessly except for this turd. well were shall I begin, 1: It laggy you will glitch and get a so called &#34;rubber band effect&#34; 2. good luck finding more than 10 servers when doing server browser. Quick match works but it will stick you in a map by yourself with no other players 99.9% of the time. You have to constantly refresh. 3. Most of the servers you DO find are full and you will have to keep trying in the hopes that someone will disconnect . 4. All the other stuff is tolerable but THIS!!! is a deal-breaker. I WILL NOT!!!! stay connected to a server. So it takes 20 min to join a server then I start playing and after about 10 minutes I disconnect with some bogus error. this happens 9 times out of 10.  This game has been out for a few years for the xbox one now and it is still SEVERELY BROKEN!!!! EA/WHQ doesn't care don't waste your time with their customer support as they are about as worthless as this game is. I didn't even bother getting Hardline because this one was so terrible. Do yourself a favor, if you want to play this game do it on PC...At least there it works. I have the premium pack and all I can say it is a poor investment (EVEN USED)  maybe some day EA and the powers that be will step up and fix this with a patch  but i wouldn't hold your breath.	2015-08-23

My boys have the Mario & Luigi remotes, so my step-daughter needed a fun one to play the Wii with too!  It works perfectly with the Wii U, you just need to sync it before use.  I'm so glad that a silicone cover comes with it.  Normally if you buy a Wii remote, you have to purchase those separately.  With kids ranging from 3-10 in our house, that silicone cover has come in SO handy -- their hands grip the remote better when it's on so it doesn't go flying through the air on certain games they play.  If you have a Wii gamer in your house, BUY this.  They'll feel special having their own remote to play with!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  Wish I could give it more stars!	2015-08-23

I admit, I have the WII edition of this game and it's better yes, but this one has some cool things in it.  I will start with a pros and cons list, pros first.<br />PROS<br />-Call of Duty Black Ops for the DS!<br />-Lots of missions and mini game to help you keep playing.<br />-Zombies is the best, but hard!  More of a challenge.<br />-The guns feel and look great on a piklelated screen.<br />-This games campaign is not the same on the console one, but they are both about two of the guys (Sgt. Michale Shaw and Capt. Alex Massion.) as the story will say stuff for each of the characters.<br />CONS<br />-The story, while decent, ends after the last missions with no one &#34;After Mission Debrifing&#34;.  It makes me wonder what happened and why there isn't a Call of Duty Black Ops ll for the 3ds.<br />-Zombies have an unfair advantage on you, one hit and your dead.  You also have a one hit kill weapon till wave eight then you need to get the power ups.<br />-I have not been able to try the multiplayer yet as DS has shut down the online servers and there are no bots for local.  My sister has a DS, but won't get this game.<br /><br />Over all, this is possibly the best DS game ever.  Save your money and get this game AND a console version and have a load of fun!	2015-08-23

Originally I only needed them because the left analog stick on my DS4 was wearing through and had a rip in it, which was annoying for gaming. I didn't want the rip to get larger so I searched for some grips, and at the time this is the best I could find. They're extremely grippy, and after hours of use they are still grippy which I see as a plus. Definitely makes using the DS4 controller a better experience and I don't have to worry about the analog sticks getting worse. These have lasted me a great while and have not noticed any wearing through, like I've seen mentioned in a few reviews. I use my DS4 heavily daily also, so it's not a lack of use. I would recommend these based off durability and prolonged use - especially to make your DS4 analog sticks last longer.	2015-08-23

My husband and two children and I play altogether, and we have a BLAST!  Easy to understand the directions, fun games, and you can even 'unlock,' more games to play!  This game can be played by one player or four. With the one player feature, of course you play against the computer characters. The more the merrier though!!!  Great characters, fun games.  A PLUS, for anyone new to Crash Bandicoot, or those familiar.	2015-08-23

You can buy this game through the XBox marketplace for $19.99, or through GameStop for the same price. The game is basically just an update to the '14 edition with small changes, hence the lower price. That this is being listed here for $50 is nothing more or less then somebody trying to make a dollar at your expense.<br /><br />As for the game, it's terrible. Honestly it's a waste of money even at $20. There are numerous reviews around the internet of this game, and it's all pretty much the same, the gameplay is poor, the cars handle terribly, there is no realism in the AI, the career mode is poorly thought out, it's filled with bugs and glitches that are so obvious that they either didn't test it or just didn't care enough to fix what are some very glaring issues. It's basically a (standalone) update to NASCAR 14, but there are many things which they did nothing to update. For example, the NASCAR All-Star race in this game used a format that was used once - in 2012. I haven't played any installment of this game prior to this one, but that's a pretty glaring mistake, shows that the developers of this game either don't care about NASCAR, don't know what's in their game, or just don't care. It's a pathetic offering that is put to shame by other racing games.	2015-08-23

A challenging, unique, and absorbing twist on the high fantasy RPG formula, The Witcher 2 revels in both rich world-building and inventive gameplay encounters.<br /><br />As Geralt of Rivia, a seasoned monster hunter with a case of amnesia and nasty habit of falling in with dangerous company, players are thrust into a riveting story of their own choosing: shades of revenge-drama, political thriller, and good ol' fashion mythical questing flesh out Geralt's search for his past and redemption. Cut into four distinctive and diverging chapters based off players' choices in-game, Geralt's journey stretches from lushly detailed forests to war ravaged wastelands, each of which hold beasts waiting to be felled and hugely entertaining side-quests to be completed.<br /><br />Combat is tactical and quite rewarding given patience and strategy. Slicing and dicing baddies, then breaking out a combo with magic runes and gadgets makes for massive fun. The game's visuals are beautiful on the 360, as well, particularly the great array of environments. Unfortunately, the game relies heavily on invisible fencing and has some awkward environmental navigation issues, often leading to frustrating situations that detract from the fun. Likewise, the game has a tough learning curve, so casual players may feel less compelled to stick with the lengthy campaign even on easier settings. Still, Assassins of Kings is a compelling, brutal ride to the dark side of fantasy no RPG fan should miss!	2015-08-23

While the spring loaded docking system is nice in some aspects, it makes things a bit difficult when the spring either fails to stay locked down or when a controller is removed without &#34;unlatching&#34; the spring. When this occurs it's almost impossible for me to get the controller redocked without picking up the charging station and finicking with lining the ports up. That being said, when the springs are in the &#34;unlatched&#34; position it's very easy to line them up and start charging.	2015-08-23

I was kind of hesitant to buy these because I read a few reviews saying that one of the sides went out after a couple weeks of use.

Nice to have one final Gran Turismo on the PS3 as a swansong before the expected move to the PS4. For trophy hunters, this game won't be the grueling grind like it was on Gran Turismo 5, and the trophies can be all acquired within a month's time if you work at it. Only gripe I might have about the game is that the &#34;damage&#34; to cars is still unrealistic and the competition title Forza on the XBox systems trounces GT in that aspect. I mean, if I hit a wall head-on at 120mph, I shouldn't be able to just steer on like nothing happened but I guess Polyphony Digital doesn't want the fun of the game to be removed on that. Still, a solid game with lots of cars, good number of tracks, and a lot of variety in what you can do in the game!	2015-08-23

WIRELESS<br /><br />Meaning... it does not plug into your controller OR the xbox with wires. Let that sink in, because that is the exceptional feature, IMHO.<br /><br />This feature has taken on increased importance for me as Windows 10 allows for game streaming from the Xbox One. My headset isn't pulling from my controller's batteries any longer. Is that a ground breaking feature? No. But some users might specifically desire it.<br /><br />The mic is rubbish.

Do not buy.<br /><br />Controls badly done, graphics muddy and PS2-like, slow long load times.<br /><br />Long:<br /><br />I get the impression the PC version of this game was good. This review is for the PS3 version, which is clearly an outsourced, probably offshore port, and horribly, horribly done. Do not buy the PS3 version. The game's gameplay is very confused - you use X to attack, pick stuff up, and talk to your fellow party members.<br /><br />That's a problem, because your party members are constantly around you, ready to talk, even when you're doing stuff. If you make the mistake of turning their way and hitting that one universal button, the game freezes while it loads up the conversation screen, and the character asks what you'd like to talk about. There is no Cancel button so you must then carefully navigate the conversation to get out of it.<br /><br />It also disarms traps, and anyone can try to disarm one at any time, even though only Rogues have a shot at succeeding. So, as an enemy beats the hell out of you, you'll hit X over and over to attack, and your character stands still with the message, &#34;Disarm trap failed&#34; flooding the screen, until you're beaten to death.<br /><br />The graphics are muddy and look worse than some PS2 games I've played. Heck I've played better looking Super Nintendo games.<br /><br />The game is insanely slow to load given how little it accomplishes. Starting it involves watching brand cutscene after cutscene, and any mode that's even slightly different involves a freeze and load time - for example moving from indoors to outdoors, between places, around a city, walking to conversation.<br /><br />Probably the worst scene in the game is one where a large puzzle must be solved by shifting tiles around, that would be very easy using a mouse or, if they'd written special controls for it, even easier on the D-Pad on the gamepad. They did not, and instead you have to very carefully walk yourcharacter around the board nudging things.<br /><br />It's too bad because there are some good plot twists and fun things to do like becoming a mage who can freeze somebody into an ice statue, then shapeshift into a golem and smash them in one hit. I bet that'd look really cool if they'd ported this game with any real developers whatsoever.	2015-08-23

This game has a consistently improving single player experience as content is expanded and improved through free updates. The PS4 version has decent enough graphics, but at times the frame rate drops and the game has long loading times in certain instances. Also, the real-time cutscenes fail once in a while.<br /><br />The game is long, but long enough - not long like a Skyrim - and the Death March difficulty is only difficult for about the first 10 or 12 levels of your character (the game's difficulty is unbalanced, with the beginning of the game significantly more difficult).<br /><br />The inventory system is slow and bothersome, but not enough so to impact the score.<br /><br />This is definitely a PC purchase, because the consoles are an afterthought. If you have a PC power enough to play this game, get it on that platform.	2015-08-23

I really wanted to like this,  but it is not for me. First, let me tell that I've been putting screen protectors and skins for years, for different smartphones, tablets, and gaming device such as gameboy, 3ds, 3ds XL, and now New 3ds Xl.I have always used dry installation, but decided to try the wet installation.<br /><br />Well, it's been 5 days since I put this, and I still can see few bubbles and smudges. I did exactly what they recommended, but it was very frustrating experience.it took me almost 2 hours to finish the whole thing. I consider myself a pro on screen protectors, but just could not get this thing right.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The screen protector is extremely shiny, and is a fingerprint and smudge magnet, it looks dirty all the time, you need to wipe the thing all the time. it attracts much more dirt than without the screen<br />- It is really hard to get the film to move freely on the device (to find the right fit), no matter how much solution you spray. It sticks right away, and it is frustrating, you have to peel some back and spray more solution and try again. It is not like they show on the video, that is for sure<br />- Even though most of bubbles and smudges have disappeared, there are some &#34;stretched&#34; film where larger bubbles were, even though the water was reabsorbed. It's been 5 days and still there, I don't think is getting much better from now on<br />- some smudges even when I know for sure I did not touch the adhesive side.<br />- within 3 days, without doing anything on my new 3ds (I have not played or taken out of its case) there was a noticeable scratch on the top of the film (outside). I though this was supposed to be scratch resistant? This never happened to my hori one.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Amazon gave me 100% refund after I complained.<br /><br />Bottom line: unless you are very experienced with wet application, and does not get bothered with an extremely shiny device (gets much worse than without the film, fingerprint and dirty magnet), I would pass. It is expensive for what it is. I am removing the film and trying other brand.	2015-08-23

The one I received was not cleaned; it had evidence of a soda spill. I was planning to do a tear-down cleaning anyway, so I did. Thankfully there was no evidence that any soda got down to the motherboard or any of the electronic parts. The joystick is loose (which happens with use), but nowhere near as loose as I have played with. Still probably going to replace. I disassembled the joystick housing, and cleaned out the plastic powder from the lower &#34;bowl&#34; (again, this is known wear with these controllers). I also cleaned the joystick as it also had soda residue on it. When the controller arrived, I heard a rattle when I shook it. When I disassembled it, I discovered that the controller was evidently dropped on the front leading edge (above where the Nintendo logo is). I discovered that both the L and R buttons had broken hinge pins, and that the L button had a crack that was visible from outside the controller shell. I found two pieces of plastic that came off of the L and R buttons, both had the hinge pins and a bit of the surrounding plastic. I also discovered three pieces of plastic that match the shell that I am not sure where they broke off of, and also a broken tab off of the &#34;Up&#34; C-button. Once all of these plastic pieces were removed, the controller stopped rattling. When the broken pieces don't seem to affect the buttons, however, and I can't feel any difference between how the buttons press in the &#34;broken&#34; controller and in an intact controller I have. I have not yet tested the controller, but I will update when I do.	2015-08-23

Arcania for PS4, if you give this epic open world RPG the chance it deserves, is an impressive game with some of the most beautiful scenic nature locals in gaming, ranging from islands, forests, jungles, beaches, cliffs, rocks, mountains, expansive caves, farm land, fields and more. This game is a lot larger than it it would first have you believe.<br />What makes this stand out is the power of the PS4 and the fact that what looks like millions of details are on the screen at one time. You get to freely explore this magnificent world with each new section unlocked through questing, defeating monsters and more. The armor, weapon, costume, magic upgrades are always interesting to see what and how your character will respond in battle.<br />If you want an up close camera view, sheath your weapons. For a distant action view, draw your weapons. You have a wide range of real time combat against lizards, fire breathing monsters, raptors, trolls, goblins, dragon flies, skeleton warriors, bandits, orcs, golems made of rock (think Witcher 3), wolves, shelled beach monsters, and many more challenging creatures. If you want to use stealth, you'll earn it as well as upgrades to your character through a charted upgrade system.<br />The controls on foot are responsive most of the time and easy to get the hang of despite some occasional misdirection with the right analog camera. Also, a lot of options to adjust as you like like sound, music, HUD icons, etc.<br />The story is amusing (or you can skip through the spoke dialog) however the characters tend to resemble the same several faces throughout the game, as if they ran out of time or people to scan into the computer. The hero character's voice actor does a solid job in his role.<br />What really draws me in is the day/night cycle which is gradual, and gives the game another sense of depth in addition to some of the best natural setting graphics I've seen on PS4 believe it or not, having played the beautiful Witcher 3 and it's lush world. While this can't compare in other graphics departments like the ocean, lighting and character designs and detail, Arcania's landscapes are truly breathtaking and went beyond what I was expecting.

Way to expensive $50 you have got to be kidding me!<br /> 2.  Very small.  It is physically painful to hold this remote.  Because it is so thin you have to hold it from the top and bottom which makes it difficult in the extreme to press the buttons.  It isn't long before your finders begin to cramp.  They probably made it this small simply because they technically could but they should not have done so.  While being beautiful to look at the texture of the remote is very slick.  Again making it hard to hold.<br />Conclusion:  The shield remote is pretty much required in order to use the machine for things like YouTube.  I put up with it because the shield is the only 4k media machine at this time.  Note that you can in many cases use your TV remote via HDMI instead for basic navigation.	2015-08-23

Things I like:<br />It will fit a big head, I have a large head, and this is one of the few wireless headsets that fit my head with room to spare.  So you got a bog noggin like me, this will fit you.<br />It comes paired and ready to go out of the box.  You charge it up for a few hours, stick the usb dongle into the Xbox one, turn on the headphones, and they link automatically.  No weird setup or linking to do.<br />The microphone is retractable.  You can slide it in or out, depending on what whether you need to use it or not.<br />The sound is good for both the mic and the headphones, really good sound actually I was impressed, for a Bluetooth wireless headset very good audio.<br />It is over the ear style meaning it covers up your ears, which provides good sound isolation, you donât hear a lot of normal outside noise with these on.<br /><br />Things I donât like:<br />The holes for your ears are not super big, so if you have extra-large adult size ears, they may not quite fit, or it may be a little uncomfortable.<br />The bright lights on the ears stay on the whole time, and while they donât get in your eyes, if you are in a dark room, as you move your head you light up the walls of the room with this green light and it can be distracting. To get rid of this you have to turn on the blackout mode.  The lights just seem bright and unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall:<br />The favorite wireless headset I have tried.  A few drawbacks but they have gotten a lot of things right on this one.  Any questions feel free to ask below or leave a comment.	2015-08-23

I myself own the Wii U deluxe edition which came with the Super Mario 3D World and Nintendoland games pre-installed. However, this product right here is overly priced due to the fact that you can get the deluxe edition for $299 and get Super Mario 3D World and Nintendoland and plus about $50 to $60 for Mario Kart 8. We are talking about $359 with the addition that you would have an extra game. This bundle is not a limited edition so the price is too high for a bundle so simple like this one. I wouldn't recommend you buying it. In addition the gamepad's battery life can be jeopardized when the battery is not recharged every six months. This bundle came out quit a long time ago and has not been in the market transit for a while, which in turn means that you are taking the risk of getting a gamepad that is more than six months old. I would suggest you look for a better offer since there is nothing special about this bundle and the price is too high.<br /><br />CONSOLE REVIEW:<br />  For those of you who are looking for a review on the console itself: well the console is a great hit of innovation. It is fun to integrate your gamepad with some of the games like Nintendoland and Mario Kart 8, etc. However, the gamepad itself is a dust magnet, so try to already have in hand a screen protector and a jacket for your gamepad before you open the box. It is not necessary though, unless you are kind of OCD like I am. The battery life is a bit lacking for it doesn't last more than 4 - 4.5 hours of game play. There are additional larger batteries that you can buy that'll last a bit longer, but it can become hard to find them cheap. Next, the console is durable when it comes to the hardware inside and the software. I've had mine for a while and there haven't been any problems with the system. However, the console is a finger stain magnet, so right out the box you will experience this by leaving your finger prints in the console. A little damp and dry microfiber cloth will do for the cleaning of your finger prints. I would bring up the specs of the CPU and GPU speeds, but it is too much of a problem since these consoles are not given too much pressure unlike PCs where this does matter a lot. I am not giving biased opinions, for I play almost all platforms of gaming systems like PCs, XBox One, Play Station 4, and the Wii U. My opinion comes merely from the experience I've had with the system I currently have. The game titles you can buy are good. I love the new Smash Bros, Mario Kart 8, Bayonetta 2 and the old Nintendo games that you can play like The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. I wouldn't recommend Bayonetta 2 for very young children though. Parents be aware what you buy for your children. I give the Wii U system a solid 4 stars since there are still some areas from which Nintendo should bring more the use of the gamepad, and the battery life is lacking in power. However, I give only one star to this particularly over priced system which has nothing special from the current deluxe edition you can buy for $299.	2015-08-23

It's not labeled very well, and mine doesn't look exactly like the picture (see my attached picture); however, it gets the job done at a no-brainer price, and the difference in quality from the standard AV/composite is definitely noticeable.<br /><br />I like how the cable matches the style of the Nintendo-official cables - it looks cohesive with my current system.<br /><br />The colored plugs on my version are a little bulky, which makes plugging them in a bit more difficult. However, it shouldn't cause any problems.<br /><br />This component cable should be as good as any - I wouldn't recommend spending significantly more for a &#34;higher-quality&#34; cable. You'll notice the difference between composite and component, but it's unlikely you'll notice any picture-quality difference between different component cables.	2015-08-23

Quick and Dirty, &#34;TL;DR&#34;) Version:<br /><br />In a nutshell, the reviews do not lie. You can gain several hours OR DAYS on a single charge, and a charge is a reasonable ~4 or so hours. Yes, it adds heft and weight, but it isn't overwhelming (though if you have weak wrists or fingers it could pose a problem). You will NEED a Phillips #00 screwdriver for both the 3DS screws and the new battery screws. I played for several hours straight on a 3DS game, plus some hours in sleep mode, WiFi and 3D on the WHOLE TIME with brightness at 3 (for comfort) - lost one bar by the end of the day. Very well worth the money.<br /><br />Full Review with Back Story:<br /><br />I bought a used 3DS from a guy on eBay. The description said &#34;Adult Owned&#34; and that it came with a charger and stylus. It looked good in pictures.<br /><br />Upon receiving it, it was in good overall condition but even after charging it fully, it would start flashing red and die within SECONDS, after only a couple hours of play, and even though 3D was off. It didn't leave me any time to save.<br /><br />I was perplexed because no one else seemed to have as awful luck with the battery as I was having. Most of what I read said that the 3DS battery was good for only about 3 hours, but it seemed that the light was supposed to turn red for awhile, THEN flash and even then, should've at least allowed for a few minutes of time to save and get it on a charger. The best I managed was with Power Save - On, Brightness - 1, 3D off, WiFi off, playing a regular DS game. I think I got about 3-4 hours max before it shut off with only 1 or 2 flashes (almost instantaneous).<br /><br />After dealing with that, I decided that the battery must have been going and so I needed to replace it if I wanted to get any portability (I mostly played on the charger).<br /><br />I was instantly attracted to this battery for the long life between charges (based on reviews). I wasn't leery about &#34;voiding my warranty&#34; since I don't have one, and the reviews put me at ease about the possibility of the battery overcharging and killing the 3DS. I didn't want to blow a comparable amount of money on a regular, OEM replacement, affording me only the regular 3DS lifespan (considering most people in the forums complained about it only lasting a few hours). I didn't even want to get a &#34;double the battery life&#34; product, when the reviews for this promised MANY hours, and even DAYS. I figured worst case scenario, I would just get better time than what I was getting, best case - tons of extra time.<br /><br />I bought mine from MPF (on Amazon), because it was cheaper than the one with free Prime shipping and they said that they provided a screwdriver tool.<br /><br />They did, but it did not work. I don't say that to deter you from buying from them but rather because you will still need a #00 Phillips. This is a pretty specific screwdriver and the cheapo jeweler/eyeglass sets generally do NOT appear to contain them (I'd bought one, but ended up taking it back). I found mine at Ace Hardware, but I would suggest just finding one on Amazon or eBay and ordering it at the same time as you order the battery. The only #00 Philips I found were parts of sets that cost over $10, but I saw singles online for $4.<br /><br />Once I finally got the back off, I discovered why my battery life was so terrible and why the flashing was so abrupt (with no regular red light to warn you). The eBay seller had completely neglected to mention that the battery was some cheap knockoff! I was worried while considering my purchase of this battery about using a non-Nintendo product - and here there was already one installed. It didn't even fit properly in the 3DS as there were folded pieces of paper keeping it snug.<br /><br />On the other hand, the new battery fit perfectly, but since it is so much more capacity, it's also so much more battery. It covers the whole back, hence it comes with its own cover and screws (shiny dark gray/black). The screws are TINY - literally about the size of ants. Again, you will NEED a Phillips #00.<br /><br />Once I got it installed, I kept the 3DS off and put it on the charger. I left it charging for several hours After around 3 hours, I tried what other reviewers have done and unplugged it and plugged it back in. Light stayed orange. (My boyfriend actually remarked that the charge light appeared to glow brighter with the new battery.) I plugged it back in and checked again (same method) after another hour. This time, the orange light went off a moment after plugging it back in.<br /><br />I took it off the charger and started playing. The weight difference was noticeable immediately, and the grasp was a little different. I turned the brightness up to 3, and turned the 3D up all the way. Kept WiFi on, volume up about halfway (no headphones). I did keep power saver on, but only for the apparent blue light reduction. Played from 5:20pm to 6:45pm.  Put it in sleep mode with WiFi on.<br /><br />Came back to it around 8pm. Played until about 11pm using the same settings as above. Still had full battery when I went to bed.<br /><br />I went to sleep and put it on the charger overnight. When I woke up, the orange light had gone off automatically, as it has all subsequent nights. I am guessing that the orange light just takes longer to go off on this battery?<br /><br />I decided to test the battery more, and I was still amazed at the new portability. I took it off the charger around 11:30am. I played off and on several hours throughout the day (WiFi on,  volume up, 3D up at times but not the entire time). Had it in sleep mode in between. Decided to even watch a 1.5 hour movie on it on Netflix. By the end of the day, I had finally managed to lose 1 bar.<br /><br />Overall, this is an incredible buy. I have always charged it at night, but I could see it easily lasting several days - particularly if you aren't playing for several hours at a time.<br /><br />The weight and added thickness *are* noticeable, but unless you are playing for hours and hours on end, I don't think it would be too much. My wrists would give out before this battery would, but I think my desire to play would give out before my wrists would.<br /><br />I also was worried that after all the time playing, it might get hot (as some reviewers mentioned with other 3rd party batteries). It did not. It barely felt warm at all, so I don't feel like I'm going to damage my 3DS with it in any way.<br /><br />Please see my photos, which include a picture of the original 3DS, the height (using a 3DS game for reference) without the battery, height with the new battery, the size of the screws against the font and next to an actual ant, the screwdriver that you'll receive if you buy it from MPF, and the screwdriver you'll actually need. My 3DS is black so the back being black doesn't matter but I would think the aesthetic difference would be worth the additional play time.<br /><br />If you own a 3DS, even if you have a real Nintendo battery in there, you can't go wrong with this. Not only could you manage full length flights, it could go on camping trips and probably survive several days on a full charge with moderate play. I almost regretted buying the 3DS (not knowing it was a knockoff battery) but this changed my mind!ny dark gray/black). The screws are TINY - literally about the size of ants.

I've been playing the app of PAD and have had tons of fun! I wasn't sure if I wanted to purchase this since I do have a great time on the free app but I went ahead and purchased it because, I am enjoying the free version so let's see what I get with this one. The game is fun and addictive! I love the contrast in the original / regular PAD and the Mario edition. Super fun and entertaining and there are so many options and monsters to choose from. Very relaxing, even though sometimes it's frustrating to beat certain levels.	2015-08-23

Itâs not too expensive, and it brings some nice additional features to the GBA.<br /><br />The Revo K101 comes with itâs own GBA flash card called a âK-cardâ. This uses Micro SD for storage, which is where you would put all of your (ahem) homebrew games. The system software appears to be contained either directly on the K-card, or on the K101 itself.<br /><br />I wrote a much more detailed review with more photos of the K101 Plus over on my blog here: https://blog.omgmog.net/post/review-the-revo-k101-plus/	2015-08-23

Ratchet is locked up for a crime he supposedly did not commit. Now Clank has to save the day and free his friend. There are alot of Clank puzzles. The graphics quality is not as good as today's games, but I'm fine with it since I grew up with 8-bit gaming. I really enjoyed the adventure. However, I think it's something about the colors, but if I play this game over an hour it makes my head hurt. Otherwise, I recommend this game to any Ratchet & Clank fans.	2015-08-23

Frame rate sucks - even on my ps4!!!  Not something I expected from a console game. Stutters a lot while playing and doesn't feel responsive. Several times it's crashed mid game and I have to kill the app and re-run. I've downloaded all updates avail for it and fully expected any issues would be fixed since this isn't a just released title. No joy. Very disappointed.<br /><br />Game play wise it suffers from the typical issues AC games have - I end up running up buildings and posts when I don't want to. Trying to move outside of cover mode means I have to stand up fully making it so that I often get spotted.  They no longer reveal all items in an area when you synchronize a viewpoint. Lots more random wandering around if I want to complete all tasks.<br /><br />I loved AC black flag - this one is pathetic compared to that.	2015-08-23

When my hands get sweaty from hot weather or extended game play they are just so slippery I have to stop and wipe my hands and the thumbstick dry.<br /><br />So if you don't have sweaty hands these are fantastic, if you do suffer from sweaty hands buy something else.	2015-08-23

I've had this for some time, I purchased it simply as an amplifier. And I must say it has done it's  job impeccably giving new life  to my gaming headset. I have the Logitech G230's  and while I think they are fantastic sounding, they are not the most efficient headset around. However upon using this with them it now makes all the sounds incredibly crisp, loud, and the bass, well it is smooth, deep, and Rich!	2015-08-23

The game itself is excellent and should not reflect upon his review but the seller who sold me a NEW copy which I paid extra for did a great job lying. Inside the secured box (which showed very little damage) it appeared that it was torn apart by a 3 year old and then put back together in hopes no one would notice. The steel game case damaged, the statue of Molag Bal damaged, the collectors art book shows signs that it was read before, the only thing that seemed new and untouched was the map and DLC codes. I intentionally waited to write this review because of how angry I was at discovering that I was hoodwinked but apparently time does not heal all wounds. Note to seller, if it's been opened, even though never played, it's no longer NEW!	2015-08-23
