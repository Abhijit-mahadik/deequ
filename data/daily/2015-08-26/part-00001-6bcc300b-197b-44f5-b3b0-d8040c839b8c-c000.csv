I agree with most reviews on here as this headset is the &#34;Casual&#34; gaming headset. It's definitely comfortable around the ear with great sound quality. In the beginning you'll have to do a controller update which updates the controller sync correctly with the adapter that comes with this.<br />The buttons are super easy to control for game/chat volume and mute/unmute buttons.<br /><br />If you want something even better, you can grab the Astro A50's.	2015-08-26

But sound quality is better elsewhere	This headset is very nice for the price...However, if your big on sound quality/audiophile type of person you will want to look elsewhere.<br />The headset fits nicely and is fairly comfortable.  The material on the ear pads doesn't breath the best so the headphones can get quite hot.<br /><br />Virtual Surround Sound -<br />The Virtual Surround Sound feature is disappointing.  Compared to a Turtle Beach or other headset with DTS 7.1 Headphone Surround Sound the sound on these headphones leaves a lot to be desired.  So the VSS is better than nothing, but if your looking to enjoy high quality sound I would look elsewhere.<br /><br />Whats in the Box -<br />Headphones, Carrying Bag, 3.5 mm cable to connect to cell phone, wireless usb dongle, Micro-USB charging cable.<br /><br />Summary -<br />If you can get them for 60 and your not looking for the most features/best sound then I would recommend picking them up.  Also the Wireless dongle works in a PC to allow wireless use.  Finally check out the Playstation App which allows you to upload game specific sound profiles to the headphones through your PS4.	2015-08-26

I purchased this game from the store, but I'm posting this review for people that are interested in buying it. Another reason is because there's a bunch of fanboys posting false reviews. Basically, I tried campaign for a few hours and some multiplayer. Both played really smooth. The graphics are really clean, it's one of the best looking games on Xbox one. For people that like the gears series, I'd say it's well worth the 40 dollar price tag. It's basically a brand new game for 20 dollars less than the usual price of a brand new game. For new comers to the series, if you like third person shooters with intense action, check it out. It's an excellent value for the price. Plus you'll get all of the other Xbox 360 versions of gears of war once those games become available for Xbox one, but I believe you need to play at least one online game within a certain time span to unlock them. I have a ps4 as well. I just like fun games. I enjoy both consoles. Don't believe the fanboys.	2015-08-26

I have played every gears including Judgment which most people skipped. Personally I was hoping for a Gears 3 remaster since that would have all the improvements and modes people have demanded over the years, but they choose Gears 1. For the price I feel like if you still have interest in this game I would definitely buy again. If you have never played a gears game and you wanted to start this is a great place. Especially since in the next come months you will be able to play Gear 2 and 3 for free (Xbox 360 versions on Xbox one) this game gives you the opportunity to play the whole franchise for $40 or less depending on where you buy it. Definitely missing Horde mode right now.<br /><br />Multiplayer has felt fluid and of course you always have your pros who dominate, but that is every multiplayer game. Shooting characters in MP and having nothing happen is one of my favorite GOW memories (sarcasm). I would say the remaster and dedicated servers have improved greatly on that. Hopefully you enjoy Gears as much as I do. Great place to start before jumping into MP is the story for practice. This game has been out for years so there are some crazy good players.	2015-08-26

I purchased these headphones so that I could play PS4 while my wife slept at night.  I work until late at night and my wife is usually sleeping by the time I get home.  This headset fits the bill perfectly.  It's a little small and the ear cups could be a little bigger (hence the 4 star rating), but what I love is that the headset plugs directly into the PS4 controller and not directly into the PS4 (unlike the Turtle Beach counterparts).  This basically makes it a semi-wireless headset.<br /><br />I haven't had any issues with other people hearing my voice and the microphone has seemed to have help up over the past couple months of use.  Another drawback would be the microphone doesn't disconnect so it's just kinda there as you play.  Overall, the sound is great, and for the price, I couldn't have asked for more.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great Sound<br />- Semi-Wireless<br />- Cheap Price<br /><br />Cons<br />- Fit is a little tight<br />- Ear cups could be bigger<br />- Microphone doesn't detatch	2015-08-26

I've been excited for it for a very long time, and I finally got it yesterday.<br />First of all, let me just tell you that I got scared. This is an intense, terrifying game!! I screamed a few times!! It was so crazy!! Choices you make really make a difference. They can hurt you, your friends, and can change your entire experience. One wrong move, and the lives of every character can be twisted around. They're scary, they're intense, and they are powerful.<br />Second, I don't want to say it's perfect. There are parts where the characters don't seem realistic. Their reactions are too over-the-top or too &#34;meh&#34; sometimes. Like, someone got mutilated. You shouldn't just go back to your stuff. Other times, it's something small making a character cry. Calm down, please!!!! Also, the walking mechanics are a bit boring and clumsy at times. The environments are too dark at times, too. I have gotten completely lost, too. One time I walked alllllll the way down a tunnel before noticing that it was the wrong way because they looked the same.<br />The bad parts are very minor, but I wanted to tell you them. This review was very quick, but I need to get back to the game. I've almost beat it!!!! And you bet your last dollar that I'll do it again!!!!	2015-08-26

In today's world, a lot of people like to look at review sites to influence their purchasing decisions. When researching Until Dawn, you'll read about how no one playthrough will be the same as another because of the deep butterfly system that can alter the plot based on the most minor of choices. In fact, one professional review mentions hundreds of different endings and thousands of branching points. Sadly, this is not the case.  The interesting part is that first time players will be captivated by Until Dawn. The story draws you in at the beginning and it makes you feel like your choices actually DO matter. However, once you reach the end, it becomes clear that much more of the plot is set in stone regardless of your decisions than was previously advertised. It's hard to go into detail without mentioning spoilers, but the ending with a playthrough where everyone survives versus one where everyone dies are actually incredibly similar. As a result, this game has stunted replayability. Furthermore, the playthroughs that were originally said to take around ten hours or so clock out closer to six or seven hours.  Is Until Dawn a bad game? No, not at all. If you enjoy the Telltale series, you'll definitely get a kick out of it. However, the devs and a lot of reviewers seem to have blown a lot of aspects of this game out of proportion, thus creating expectations based on a work of fiction.	2015-08-26

US	44605942	R3MLEGOWMUNQ5W	B00JUHZBRG	540741509	Dragon Age Inquisition	Video Games	4	2	3	N	Y	Played through six times so far	I've played this through six times now, and feel as if I can share my thoughts on it fairly well at this point.  Initially I had trouble.  I had a brand new computer, specifically for gaming, but when I tried to play this, it kept saying I didn't meet the requirements.  It seems some sort of security feature was blocking the game.  A clean boot fixed the issue and the game worked great after that.  So, if you have trouble getting started, I recommend googling how to do this.  The graphics are absolutely gorgeous.  I had to stop and show my husband at one point when my party was in a desert setting, looking at their shadows across the sand.  It is stunning.  The graphics are so amazing that they gave me pretty bad motion sickness at first.  It took me a few times playing to realize that was what was making me sick.  Unfortunately the only thing for it was to take breaks.  The good news is it got better.  Dramamine helps!  I've heard that maybe a tenth of people have this issue, so chances are good you will not be one of them.  The controls are very different than the previous two Dragon Age games.  I'm not sure why this decision was made.  If you go straight from Dragon Age 2 to this one, you're going to feel very awkward at first, until you get used to it.  If you happen to play Dungeons and Dragons Online, the controls are ALMOST identical to those in that game, so you'll find this very easy to get used to.  I don't care much for the tactical camera, so I can't tell you a lot about it, but the similarity to DDO was helpful to me.  One thing I did like is that you can hit the letter &#34;R&#34; to do a basic attack, and holding it down will keep you repeating that.  And the letter &#34;F&#34; is your &#34;use&#34; button.  It all means fewer mouse clicks, which makes things go smoother, in my opinion.  In the past two games, you had six NPCs to choose from.  Two warriors, two rogues, and two mages.  In Inquisition, you have nine.  They are all very &#34;human&#34; (even if they're not), well developed, complex characters.  But in my opinion nine is too many and it's impossible to get the most you can out of all of them in a single game.  Multiple play-throughs is the only answer.  I've played through several of the romances, but not all of them yet.  I have yet to romance Josephine or Cassandra, but I will probably get around to it eventually.  All of the romances are interesting and provide a lot of extra insight into the NPC you are romancing, with one exception.  The Solas romance has barely any content.  Four scenes, to be specific.  There is much more there with everyone else.  I found it a major letdown.  That said, there are many people online who are quite fond of that romance, so if you find yourself quite taken with him, and if he seems into your character, enjoy.  One other thing I'm less thrilled with, regarding the romances, is that some characters do have limitations regarding who they will be with.  There are some characters who will only romance a particular gender, or certain races, much like in the first Dragon Age game, although I realize that one didn't limit you based on race.  In my first play-through, which I did while avoiding spoilers, I was disappointed to realize the person I most wanted to romance was unavailable to the gender I was playing.  While there is a great deal of criticism of Dragon Age 2, one of the things I had really liked about it was the fact that you could romance whoever you wanted, regardless of your character's gender.  Something I do think is an improvement, however, over the past games, is that it makes very clear when you have an option of beginning a romance with a character, and you can choose not to do so without getting into an awkward situation that makes them get upset with you.  In that first game, I found it impossible to turn down Zevran and Leliana without earning a great deal of disapproval, and chances were good that eventually you would have to either do that or just be with them.  I was not thrilled with the Inquisitor specializations.  Every one of them was already being used by one of your NPCs.  In the past games there were options that were not necessarily already being used by an NPC, allowing you to avoid redundance, even if it is a matter of flavor.  The specializations are fun, but you're going to match some NPC's path no matter what you choose.  Except that it will be harder for you to get your specialization than it is for your NPC, so chances are good that whatever you have, there's an NPC who is better at it than you, unless you specifically avoid advancing your NPCs in their specializations.  Something else I liked about Inquisition is that you can feel free to move the plot forward, and you will still have access to all of your previous quests.  The exception being the end of the game.  It tells you that you can continue to play after you've done the final plotline, and this is true, but there will be no more dialogue between yourself and the NPCs, and it really feels as if it doesn't count.  Just save the final plot point for last, which seems rather obvious.  Well, that is everything I can think of!	2015-08-26

Sounds like the quality is still junk grade as the gamepads I had quit registering because they are prone invisible wire breaks and also buttons going out.

You now can throw outside shoulder fades and actually complete a pass!<br /><br />The new receiving controls are impressive and give a much needed overhaul to the passing game. Still, EA fails to make simple overhauls Madden fans have been clamoring for the last few years. The in game commentary is the same old song and dance, relocating a team is not as fun as you'd think as they didn't change any name choices and hardly any uniform options from '15, and running the financial side of a team feels hollow and unsatisfying. The new scouting system is fresh but at the same time does not really help you effectively identify the best players in a draft class.<br /><br />The in game experience is fun, though defensively it doesn't really feel like you have any control over the game. Running the ball is great, speedy backs feel quick and hard to catch, power backs bust through tackles regularly, and you don't get tripped up/tackled by your own linemen.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun in game experience, Madden 16 is great. If you're expecting Madden 16 to finally deliver fans from the stagnation that has plagued this series for the last few years, you will be disappointed. It's the same old Madden with a couple of new tricks and a new coat of paint.	2015-08-26

From new catching system to the new mode, Draft Champions, Madden has definitely improved from the last cycle. Presentation wise, Madden delivers from the opening with my Steelers vs the Cardinals in what could be a potential SuperBowl 50 matchup. (Don’t believe me? Ray Lewis who had an intro in Madden 13 went to the Superbowl and last year with the Seahawks who went to the Superbowl).<br /><br />Modes wise, I am a huge CFM guy and was pleased with the new UI and commissioner features. Although there are a few things missing to make the mode great, CFM fans will be satisfied with the mode. The new mode “Draft Champions” is awesome for a casual Madden player. You get to draft 15 rounds and battle it out either online or with the CPU.<br /><br />WR/DB interactions has FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY made it into Madden. Word of advice, don’t think that you will intercept every pass or catch every aggressive deep ball you throw because you will be sadly mistaken and disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, if you haven’t played Madden in a while or you’ve decided to hang up your sticks, give Madden NFL 16 a try.	2015-08-26

The &#34;boss&#34; in sequence 7, memory 3 was the last straw for me. They had you mash the circle button over and over, and I could not defeat the stupid Bellec. I don't mind a challenge when I play a game, but I want to have fun. I have played all the Assassins Creed games, and this is the first one that I do not recommend.	2015-08-26

US	27111413	R1J5KNPMZNQXEC	B002I092MM	976442722	Super Mario 3D Land	Video Games	3	0	1	N	N	easy game made annoying by awful camera	My save file has 5 sparkling stars, so I can't claim this isn't a fun game considering all the time I've sunk into it....<br />However, it has major flaws.<br />1. First, the forced &#34;2.5-D&#34; perspective or whatever the technical term is. I HATE the camera in this game. This game is very easy. The challenge exists solely in how much you're not allowed to see from moment to moment. The camera swings around to different distances and angles constantly and arbitrarily, preconfigured on a track made by the game designers. Most often, it only moves when Mario moves, so if you're in an area and there's a enemy just offscreen, the camera won't back up to allow you to see the enemy until you walk to where the enemy IS! Did it kill or hurt you from offscreen in your moronic quest to get permission from the camera to see it? Screw you, love - the game makers. There's a boss battle at the end of the game with a boss trolling the far wall and a boss trolling the near wall. If you inch forward at all, the camera zooms past the near enemy to focus on the far wall. You have to hit one boss then the other until both are dead. Not really hard at all. Except the camera will not allow you to see the near wall enemy unless you move Mario all the way from the far wall to the near wall. This is beyond annoying because trying to attack the near boss when the game won't allow you to locate it is not hard, it's stupid. The camera pulls back far enough to find the boss only after you moved close enough to be in it's attack range. Infuriating. Not to mention the camera zooms to the left or right side of the room depending on where you are, so you never know why you still can't see the near enemy. Do I need to move toward the center or closer to the camera?...oh I died.<br />Another common instance is often the in-level shift from &#34;3d&#34; to &#34;2d&#34;. You'll be humming along in a level with the camera showing you depth, then randomly it'll pan to show the classic 2d perspective.Having removed your ability to perceive depth, the game then kills you because while navigating obstacles you pushed Mario too near or far from the camera and fell off the platform. There's no way to know this is happening until you're watching the death animation. The camera stinks.<br />2. Lousy bosses. There are two bosses in this game. Bowser and the spinning/boomerang twins. That's it. Them over and over and over.<br />3. The death system. I don't get this. If I start a level with a suit and then die, I'm immediately put back at the start of the level without the suit. For the impatient, you can try the level that just killed you except in a weaker state. If you wanted retry the level with your suit back, you had to quit to the main menu and reload your save. Huge waste of time. I did this every time I died. The game rewards this behavior btw. I was never offered the super tanooki suit because the game never knew I died on a level 5+ times. If you use the super suit even once, you can't get shiny stars on your save file. I understand being precious with suits to reward good players in NES Mario because there's no save file. Except this is a level based game. If I want to play a given level with a specific suit, I shouldn't have to play another level, retrieve the suit I want, take that suit in the overworld so I can try the other level suited up. That's not rewarding anything.<br /><br />Playing this, I kept reminiscing &#34;remember all those super fun times you died in NES SMB or SM64 because the camera wouldn't let you see where you were going? Ah the memori...wait, that never happened! Those games were actually good!&#34;	2015-08-26

Play the original	Gears Of War the original was the reason I purchased an Xbox 360. I can still remember my first time seeing the Mad World commercial, turning off the tv and proceeding to the nearest Target. This remaster is a complete let down. As much as I have heard complaints about the Halo Master Chief Collection (Multiplayer, XBox Live, etc), the gameplay itself was solid. Which brings me to Gears. I could hardly play through the first 10 mins of this game. I looks like they just cobbled a bunch of higher resolution textures together and scripted it along with a few sound effects. This remaster is amateur at best.<br /><br />Sound.<br />Horrible. Everything is level, the explosions, the voices and other effects have no depth. Its as if you are listening to the game through some tin cans. There is even  a slight echo in the character voices as if they are in a sound booth... smh<br /><br />Effects.<br />Amateur. Here is an example of how poorly done the effects in the game are. I noticed that while shooting that the bullets seem to have the same travel and collision effect no matter how far the object I was shooting was. I shot a wall next to me and turned and shot a wall, a car, and even the ground distances ranging from near to far and it looks like the bullets go about 10ft and collide and disappear. The game also has poor depth perception between the characters. I would compare this to playing one of those poorly made javascript games online in your browser.<br /><br />Graphics.<br />This is where the game stands out. While you are standing still the game looks beautiful. The visuals and imagery looks great, but moving around ruins this effect.<br /><br />Overall this game looks and feel last minute and rushed. As I type this, i cant help but have the feeling that the developers did not care to remake the actual campaign portion of the game and opted to dedicate all or their resources to the online multiplayer. This sucks because I can care less for the multiplayer aspect of the game.	2015-08-26

Starting with completing an easy installation I immediately put on rubber grips in attempt to decrease ware for the thumb sticks.  Then proceeded to jump into playing a game, immediately finding that the hollow centers of the analog sticks did not have a proper depth resulting in a massive amount of friction from the underside of the rubber grip against the controller.  I then tried to pull the thumb sticks a bit out only to find they went to the same position after clicking the thumb stick down multiple times and if I pulled the thumb sticks out to far there would be friction from another part of the inside of the controller rubbing against the spherical part of the analog stick.  End result, removing the rubber grips. 2) Play time and level of wear - (Short answer)  Will wear quick if you play a ton, but have no reason to believe they will if used casually.   I began using these twenty days prior to this post.  I cannot give a proper number estimate in which I have used these, being that It would cause mental anguish realizing the number of hours I have spent these past twenty days playing video games.  However, I can paint a quick picture.  I am a full time college student who is a massive introvert and on a summer break free of obligation.  Spending a day (7-9 hours) on video games feels like a blink and I more often than not plan on waking up the next day and starting again.  This level of milage took the rubber part of the thumb sticks straight off the plastic center stiff portion of the thumb sticks.  They still work, but the rubbery portions fold down when shifting/moving the weight of your thumbs to dictate the movements of your in game avatar.  In conclusion, these thumb sticks are great for their price, but may not be the best fit for you if you put in an excessive amount of hours in video games and want a thumb stick that will last a long time.	2015-08-26

She is 84 and they keep her busy and satisfied - she loves them.  This particular game, however, did not work right at all.  There were times it would just lock up and we could not go any further.  We looked on line and saw that several other people had those same issues.  Something is definitely not programmed properly in this game so I would steer away from this particular one.	2015-08-26

US	51165959	R1ET4BICLKMO5M	B00J48MUS4	928566066	Assassin's Creed Unity	Video Games	4	2	2	N	N	Not so bad if you didn't buy the game at its initial release	I bought and played this game some 6+ months after its initial release and actually found it very enjoyable with most of the major glitches now patched.  Obviously, Ubisoft is still a money-grubbing corporation that should be ashamed of releasing an incomplete game.  But for people that got the game upon its release and gave up due to the glitches, I would suggest giving the game a second shot.<br /><br />So here are the pros and cons in easy to read bullet point:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Lots of different things to do: Like most of the Assassin's Creed games, there are lots of side quests and little things to occupy your time between story missions.  I actually thought the murder mysteries and the Nostradamus puzzles a fun departure from the regular beat-them-up side quests.<br />* Eagle Vision becomes more useful: Up until this game, I've never really had to use much Eagle Vision asides from finding Glyphs and because the games told me to.  With more enemies and the ability to go inside buildings and underground, Eagle Vision becomes more important in knowing where enemies are.<br />* Multi-player missions are a challenge: I confess that I played all the multiplayer missions as a single player (I don't play well with others).  And yes, single player is an option that you can access through the world map.  The ones where you have to remain undetected for highest level of reward can be frustratingly fun.<br />* Graphics are an improvement: The city of Paris looks beautiful here.  The cut scenes are also vast improvements over previous games where the characters just look plain terrible and their lip movements often don't match the sound.<br />* Better economy system: The game does a good job of not giving you too much money too fast.  I thought that was actually an issue with previous games where you have so much money that you can buy all the gear you want plus all of Rome halfway through the game.  With the different level treasure chests, there are actuallya good amount of money that you won't have access to initially so it forces you to make trade offs between improving your theater (which will slowly give you more money) or buying gear.  It also helps that the top level gears are very expensive.  Even at the end of the game, I cannot afford all the available gears and their upgrades.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring story: The major players in the plot are all so interchangeable.  One old white French guy look like all the other old white French guys.  **spoiler** And at some point in the story, Arno is kicked out of the Assassin order but then it seems like it was never brought up again and he went on being an Assassin **end spoiler**  Even though I recently finished this game, I can't tell you what the story actually was about.  Something about helping his Templar childhood best friend avenge her father?<br />* Terrible character movements: Upon first playing Arno, I felt his movements to be incredibly clumsy when compared with Altair, Ezio, or even Connor.  The controls felt unresponsive and trying to get Arno through a window can be super frustrating while trying to be stealthy.  For a game where probably 95% of getting around is by climbing and jumping, having unresponsive controls makes the gameplay pretty unenjoyable.<br />* Messy, complicated menus: It was difficult for me to figure out how to navigate the in-game menus.  During the Nostradamus puzzles, it would be nice if the clue stayed somewhere on screen or is easily accessible some way.  To this day, I don't have a clear idea of how to access those clues except by looking through several screens of menus.  Same goes for any option to quit a mission.  I had to look that up online.<br /><br />So my conclusion is that this is a pretty fun game.  The missions and side quests are enjoyable and the graphics look nice.  The most frustrating thing about it is probably Arno's movements and how unresponsive the controls are.  I typically don't care a lot forstories, so having a boring story doesn't hurt my opinion of the game too much.  I just wished I knew who I was killing and why.	2015-08-26

How many times have we bought this game, at least for me and been instantly disappointed ? Let's see, everytime !  I immediately sell it and wait for the basketball g9ames.<br /><br />If you are super hardcore Madden guy that plays annually looking for full breakdowns maybe try another review.<br /><br />From the jump, nice cover choice.  However wasn 't this kid a rookie last season ? Quite an Ode to Odell I'd say he's gotta be geeked to see himself on the cover and with three different moving animations on the title screen.  Last year that Seattle title screen was cut and pasted by a child.<br /><br />Probably the best news to me is the new Draft Champions mode.  You draft a 15 round  draft and fill your team up that already has 50-70 rated players.  These players range from high 70's to high 80's, and close off the 15th round with a legend.  It's really nice that each round gives you deptch chart beneath each player, very slick ! If you win three games you go to SB.  If you lose more than one game you're done.  You can play offline or online.  Here's the best part, it replaces MUT, and the craziness of building legend teams that gets so outta hand.  I will still play MUT but this is a way better idea to me, cuz I'm not about to pay out of my pocket towards chasing legends.  Also, why buy the deluxe or super deluxe editions unless you are a MUT freak.  Thanks Draft Champions !<br /><br />The opening game sequence is very cool, with different endings that gets you hyped to play.  However your mom could suceed in its format it's more like a cutscene button push.<br /><br />Gameplay is exciting again with playmaker ability for catching and defending.  That alone is a huge improvement on stale gameplay of the past.<br /><br />I started and ended my connected franchise because I'm really too busy this week, didn't want to take simmed losses.<br /><br />Graphics are almost too good with camera panning in and out at well choreographed times is great but dang so much movement on the screen at times it's a eyeball meltdown.<br /><br />I usually play on all pro, but I went back to pro so I can basically start over.  I have really missed out on many years of changes to controls. It's a bit overwhelming honestly if you haven't played in a while full force.  Basic gameplay is easy to recall, but it's all the micro adjustments at the line of scrimmage that have me a little overwhelmed.<br /><br />Wrapping up.  It plays well.  It's fun again.  It looks great.  This is the first year I didn't have instant buyers remorse.  This is a year you might want to consider downloading the game.  Clearly I was impressed.  I gave it 5 stars, maybe if you were a annual Madden big shot you could give it a 4 cuz other than Draft Champions and playmaker it's the same game, but there's so much polish and the gameplay gets such a big boost.  All of you waiting for a legit Madden to jump back in, this is the year.  Trust me I'm a Madden pessimist.  Jump back in !n all pro, but I went back to pro so I can basically start over.

Madden 16 is the same as Madden 15 and Madden 25, besides new players, the voice of Den Roethlisberger when you play for the first time, Draft Champions, more passing options, and U.S. Bank Stadium. I wasn't going to buy it until I heard a great review on WCCO radio about U.S. Bank Stadium in game as being detailed, but that was a letdown. It was detailed in that synchronized fans, empty concourse, and no exterior view Madden way. If you have Madden 15 or Madden 25 don't buy this. If you don't have Madden 15 or Madden 25, buy one of those because it's much cheaper for essentially the same game.	2015-08-26

I purchased this game on Amazon because I couldn't find it locally. Who would have thought, a game this old isn't available new in stores these days. I feel silly thinking it might be. So why did I want a game this old? Well for one, it is amazing! Really though I had to get this game for my 16 year old daughter as one of her birthday gifts. She loves Sims 3 and has almost all the expansions and she heard that SIMS2 was great and wanted to try it. She loves making up SIMS stories and posts them on instagram. She has a lot of followers too! I guess it was just a matter of time before she wanted SIMS2 and those expansions to collect to. Anyway, I just wanted to review that she loves this game, it isn't out dated, and it is worth getting even if you have to find a used copy! My daughter was able to put this game on her brand new laptop and it plays great.	2015-08-26

(while it lasted)	I very much liked it while it lasted. Unfortunately, like other reviewers on here, my scroll wheel broke after a few months usage. I now need to purchase a new mouse. If I hadn't seen the other reviews with a similar problem, I may have just bought another one. Now, I'm not so sure, I may just go spend a bit more and get a more trusted brand.  UPDATE (9/24/25): Eagletec customer service quickly reached out and offered replacement including shipment. I needed a replacement faster than shipping to them and waiting for a replacement, plus I wanted a wireless keyboard running off the same usb plug. Therefor, I ended up not taking their offer. I did find their keyboard/mouse offering and, because of the great price, decided to give it a try. We'll see how that goes. PnP setup was easy and I like the feel of the the products, but longevity is a question that only time can answer.	2015-08-26

The Good:<br /><br />It's Gears of War, and it was fantastic when it came out. It's an extremely well done remake for the Xbox One, they did a great job with it.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />It's -only- Gears of War. If you want the original game with no improvements aside from the graphics, that's what's included; but let's face it, the series came a long way in the sequels with massive improvements to everything from the controls to gameplay options. There's no Horde mode,  there's no bot matches, and so on.<br /><br />I love Gears, and it's a great nostalgia kick, but I don't think that's enough considering how good the old games still look on the 360 anyway.<br /><br />I feel bad giving this three stars, but after the rush of the reunion with an old friend it just made me miss Gears 3's gameplay instead. It's a well done remake, but it's just not a must-have without the improvements the sequels brought to the series.	2015-08-26

They could not get into the game though. The first part of the game, where the character has to dodge zombies, became boring to them and I think the random zombie moans scared them a bit. I tried playing and felt the same way.  There was no thought process involved. Just running and jumping through the obstacles. In light of the other games available for the DS, this one was just &#34;ok&#34;.	2015-08-26

The Headset is very comfy and you can wear it for hours on end, but the sound isnt that good. I have 40 dollar turtle beaches and they are one of the best headsets ive ever owned, they are loud, comfy, and have a good mic. However the mic on this headset is CRAP.

Worth noting is that the xbox one does not come ready to play out of the box.  Several updates stack up and can take hours depending on your Internet connection.  A wired connection is recommended as the xbo has slow wireless speeds (even checked against other devices).  Another grievance is that the halo mcc takes a long time to download.  I wasn't able to play until after the first day which included leaving the console on overnight.

If you enjoy interactive movie type games such as Heavy Rain (PS3) and Indigo Prophecy (PS2), you'll love this game. This game is primarily about telling you a story where you make decisions that could impact how the story unfolds. So don't expect a first person shooter or action type game. You will walk around the map finding clues and watching cutscenes with minimal action buttons in between.<br /><br />Bugs:<br />For a day one release, I am pretty impressed. It seems the last several games I have gotten day one have been packed with bugs. Not the case with Until Dawn. I haven't encountered a single hiccup, restart, or freeze. And I don't really recall even downloading a patch when I put the disc in.<br /><br />Controls:<br />Again, for a day one release, I have not encountered any control issues. Pretty basic stuff as far as walking around with the left analog stick. The right analog stick moves the camera ever so slightly. A triangle here, a circle here, and a few Xs. They even incorporated the use of the pad in certain scenes. Nothing really advanced or hard to get used to. There's even a little tutorial as you're moving around to tell you what controls to use.<br /><br />Story:<br />The story is what this game is all about. The story is pretty similar to a typical horror flick. A group of teens, a few cabins in the woods, and a killer on the loose! Several scenes are designed to make you jump and the really good ones will record you if you have a Playstation Camera attached. Don't worry, by default this setting is turned off, so you will need to turn it on in the options if you want to see a playback of the scene and your reaction.You do get a chance to play as each of the characters with no option of switching between them. Each character has their own sort of story as they split off from the main group. So far, I haven't been too attached to any of the characters. I feel like that's onepart that could have been improved on. That said, the overall story is keeping me interested and wanting to find out more.	2015-08-26

Shame on you Microsoft. Your &#34;next gen&#34; hardware can barely run a 10 year old game at 30 fps. Pathetic! I cant believe how you are marketing the game as a 1080p 60 fps remake when it runs single player at 30 fps and multiplayer at a very inconsistent and juttery 45-60 fps. I want a full refund as this is not what you advertised to me when I bought It. This is a horrible remake of an amazing game. If you can do halo 4 at 60 fps why not gears?? it dosent even make sense.

When I first got this game, I played it for two hours, and didn't touch it for a few weeks.

I didn't think much of this game - it was kind of fun, but I have plenty of ways to murder pixels in other games.  Then, I had a friend over, and man, this is excellent when you have someone there to share a moment with when you drop a large church organ on a group of knights.

I have spent around 14 hours playing the game across two complete play through's. The story is a mashup scenes from classic horror movies. They also throw in some Chaos Theory ideas. There are unique endings dependent on choices and anyone can die. The way the game analyses your own fears and uses them against you is a good concept as well. I do not believe I was ever scared but I was on edge the whole time.<br /><br />If you enjoy Horror Movies, The Butterfly Effect, Heavy Rain, or just being able to make the dumb blonde girl run instead of being killed like a idiot, then support this Developer and buy this game.

In the 80's, 90's, and even early 2000's, these dominated the horror film market, giving viewers increasingly absurd and implausible situations to watch teenagers get hacked to bits over. That's an oversimplification, of course. There were dozens of genuinely good movies that took the formula and twisted it around in fun ways. &#34;April Fool's Day,&#34; for example, or &#34;Sleepaway Camp,&#34; &#34;Scream,&#34; and maybe even every &#34;Friday The 13th&#34; after the sixth one. The point I'm making is, this is a genre in need of some love. All we get now are the same ghost stories, the same &#34;found footage&#34; flicks, ad nauseum. The only thing in recent years that's truly impressed me was the gleefully chaotic &#34;Unfriended,&#34; and that wasn't even a &#34;proper&#34; slasher flick. So, with Supermassive Game's much-hyped &#34;Until Dawn&#34; presenting itself as a sort of interactive slasher movie, I got pretty giddy with excitement. But is it another &#34;Night Trap,&#34; the deservedly ill-fated Sega CD &#34;game&#34;? Or is this finally the resurgence I've been waiting for?<br /><br />The answer is &#34;sort of kind of,&#34; but don't let that sound like a knock against the quality of this riveting little thrill ride of a game. Because, up through the very last moment, &#34;Until Dawn&#34; delivers not only more scares, more twists, and more ridiculous gore than most modern horror films, but manages to hearken back to the PS2 glory days of survival horror while it's at it. It's the best of modern and classic horror films, while still managing to be a surprisingly proficient game in its own right. Oh, and did I mention that it's horrifying? Because it really is.<br /><br />Truthfully, the set-up is perhaps the most benign and predictable out there, at least as far as these sorts of affairs go. Some teenagers go to a remote ski lodge one year after two of their friends bit the dust, trying to rekindle the flames of their friendship. Of course, most of them are also trying to get laid, because this is a horror joint and of course they are. Sadly, not one, but two masked maniacs are there to try and put a damper on their fun, to the tune of flamethrowers, &#34;Saw&#34;-style death chambers, and trained wolves. Also, ghosts, Also, ambiguously cannibalistic monsters. Also, ancient Native American spirits. Yep.<br /><br />The thing about &#34;Until Dawn&#34; is that none of it makes any sense until about 3/4 of the way through the game, and believe it or not, that actually works to its advantage. Instead of being content to scare players with one consistent threat, there are numerous forces to contend with, and none of them feel like they have any connection with each other. What does a ghost have to do with a perverted man in a clown mask, or a flamethrowing maniac with malevolent mountain creatures? More than you might think, actually, and that's where the true strength of &#34;Until Dawn&#34;'s narrative comes to the forefront.<br /><br />In 2012, &#34;Cabin in the Woods&#34; took every horror movie trope imaginable and mashed them together, then gave the most cop-out and ludicrous reason why they were all there. Of course, that's a great movie, but it went really far with the absurd comedy. &#34;Until Dawn&#34; does the polar opposite. It takes every horror trope imaginable, then gives a completely plausible and compelling reason why, exactly, all of them decided to converge on this particular night and assail this particular set of teens. The late-game twists aren't actually funny... at least, not intentionally. Everything feels very sincere and authentic in its attempts to weave a yarn, and that's something I admire. It's not cheap. It's not a satire. It's horror, through and through, until the very end.<br /><br />That counts double for the gameplay as well, which is a glorious and satisfying return to older survival horror games. Cantered camera angles, slow controls, selective lighting... it's all here, recreated in loving detail by a developer who obviously cares about the genre. Even the best new horror titles either take a first-person view (&#34;Alien: Isolation,&#34; &#34;P.T.,&#34; ) or an over-the-shoulder view (&#34;Dead Space,&#34; &#34;The Evil Within,&#34;) when it comes to guiding the player. Not &#34;Until Dawn.&#34; The camera is perpetually at a fixed angle, bringing to mind the vintage &#34;Silent Hill&#34; or &#34;Resident Evil&#34; titles. However, because this is 2015, the controls are more responsive, more smooth, when it comes to directing characters to their potential demise. It takes an aspect about older horror games that I positively adore, them modernizes it in a way that I had previously thought to be impossible.<br /><br />But where the gameplay diverges a bit is in the combat. Namely, there isn't really any, outside of some context-sensitive events, which play out very much like a game helmed by David Cage. However, this is Cage gameplay in the hands of a developer who actually knows what they're doing, so the result is a game that doesn't feel like an interactive movie. In PS2-era survival horror games, confronting the threats at hand would lead into bouts of janky combat that sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. I have a soft spot for that gameplay, but it just doesn't hold up in this day and age. &#34;Until Dawn&#34; takes the survival horror mold, rips out the combat, and replaces it with quick-time event segments. Now, I really hate modern gaming's reliance on QTEs, as I usually feel like it's just an excuse for lazy game design, but in the case of this game, it actually works. They're not abused, and when they're used, it feels urgent and tense. And, most importantly, you usually see immediate consequences for failing them. Characters will lose items, get hurt, and sometimes straight-up die if you miss prompts. In most games, players will just see a slight riff on the same basic flow of events. In &#34;Until Dawn,&#34; the central gimmick of &#34;you control who lives and dies&#34; ends up feeling like a fulfilled (and tense) promise as opposed to marketing hype-speak.<br /><br />That could be said of this whole package. Everything about the way &#34;Until Dawn&#34; has been marketed made me think I'd despise it. &#34;It's an interactive slasher movie,&#34; they said. &#34;It has cutting edge visuals and well-known actors,&#34; they said. &#34;It'll make you scream out loud,&#34; they said. I scoffed at all of this, but I was proven wrong. This game is a subversive and truly disturbing take on slasher films, and takes some totally out-of-left-field twists near the end that made me cackle at their absurdity. It has some truly gorgeous visuals, perhaps the best on the PS4, aided by a haunting and masterful art direction and some stellar performances from Panettiere, Rami Malek, and, most importantly, the inimitable Peter Stormare. And, all tied together with tense gameplay that blends old-school progression and new-school action, the result is a tense, terrifying experience that made me actually cover my eyes and scream out loud more times than I'd like to admit.<br /><br />&#34;Until Dawn&#34; was something that I went in expecting to hate every hour it dragged on, but instead, I found myself hanging on every second, even through the ending credits. The scares feel very real and palpable. The threat of permanent death is around every corner. The plot keeps you guessing even after the game wraps up. Simply put, Supermassive has taken my favorite type of interactive horror experience and modernized it, crafting something that genuinely scares and feels like it has a lot of love put into it.

I'll take it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- A twisty and absurd story that shocks through the ending.<br />- Loads of replay value that's organized in a steamlined way.<br />- Tense gameplay that feels interactive and not passive.<br />- A great throwback to older titles with some fresh twists.<br />- Beautiful visuals that render an excellent art direction.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The early hours are deceptively simple.<br />- Absurd late-game twists might not impress everyone.<br /><br />Score: 9.25 (out of 10)of events. In &#34;Until Dawn,&#34; the central gimmick of &#34;you control who lives and dies&#34; ends up feeling like a fulfilled (and tense) promise as opposed to marketing hype-speak.<br /><br />That could be said of this whole package. Everything about the way &#34;Until Dawn&#34; has been marketed made me think I'd despise it. &#34;It's an interactive slasher movie,&#34; they said. &#34;It has cutting edge visuals and well-known actors,&#34; they said. &#34;It'll make you scream out loud,&#34; they said. I scoffed at all of this, but I was proven wrong. This game is a subversive and truly disturbing take on slasher films, and takes some totally out-of-left-field twists near the end that made me cackle at their absurdity. It has some truly gorgeous visuals, perhaps the best on the PS4, aided by a haunting and masterful art direction and some stellar performances from Panettiere, Rami Malek, and, most importantly, the inimitable Peter Stormare. And, all tied together with tense gameplay that blends old-school progression and new-school action, the result is a tense, terrifying experience that made me actually cover my eyes and scream out loud more times than I'd like to admit.<br /><br />&#34;Until Dawn&#34; was something that I went in expecting to hate every hour it dragged on, but instead, I found myself hanging on every second, even through the ending credits. The scares feel very real and palpable. The threat of permanent death is around every corner. The plot keeps you guessing even after the game wraps up.

Following horror clichés, everyone is horny for each other and the melodrama is laid on thick until eventually the lights go out and bodies hit the floor.<br /><br />Until Dawn is the interactive movie style genre taken to its most extreme. Gameplay is limited to exploring small areas, examining clues, and making binary dialog choices at key moments. Each character has different attributes that dictate their honesty or bravery as well as their relationship with the other characters. Some action scenes call for quick time events including aiming a weapon or holding the controller still.<br /><br />What makes this game truly unique is that your choices --actually-- matter. Addressing a criticism with Telltale or Quantic Dreams games, Until Dawn features an element called &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; where your choices have an impact on following events. Practically drawing from games like The Witcher or Alpha Protocol, your actions (or even inaction) won't have a noticeable effect until make later. This is all tracked in-game with a handy menu that shows what choice you made and how it effects the flow of events that follow. You can't replay sections until you beat the game: once you choose that's it.<br /><br />Until Dawn revels in its genre. Aesthetically it pays homage to modern horror like Saw with the tongue-in-cheek self awareness of Scream, the cinematography and pacing of Halloween, and the sex charged melodramatic characterization of Friday the 13th. Horror movie fans will find something to like and it makes a great game to play with non-gamer friends who scream out suggestions for choices. Visually it's above average with realistic yet creepy facial capture (Peter Stormare's character being a standout) and suitably detailed locations although the occasional framerate hitch can pull you out. The acting and writing swings from excellent to laughably terrible. It's hard to tell how self aware everyone was as the subject matter is treated seriously even though a scene could be two girls literally shouting &#34;SLUT! WHORE&#34; for five minutes. Again, standard teenage horror movie fare.<br /><br />I hesitated to pull the trigger at $60 but Until Dawn is a surprisingly content rich game. If you're going for 100% you've got 16+ hours ahead of you. People put off by titles like Telltale's The Walking Dead or Life is Strange won't find much to but both horror fans and adventure game fans will be right at home.	2015-08-26

They really went all out fixing in game mechanics here, the fight for the ball while it's in the air feature is amazing, and unlike Maddens of the past, this one actually got the defense right! No longer can a rated 70 tackle block a rated 90's defensive end perfectly, or an offensive line block for ten seconds every play (it happens, but like in real life, it doesn't happen often), meaning you have to keep a tight end or a halfback in to block if your line isn't very good. The entire physics of the game is just amazing, and it takes strategy to win a game, not just chucking the ball on a post route every other play to get massive yards, the defense will stop things you do often, like in real life they adjust as the game goes on. The offense also has a few new pocket and qb features that make things feel much more real. 5 stars for that.  Now onto why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Franchise mode is pretty much how it was last year but with a new face. However I will say the new drafting method (which include combine numbers) is cool, as well is the player progression, no longer can a rated 69 guy jump to the 90's in one season. Also, there is no defensive assignments which is out right ridiculous! It makes playing online horrible cause people just put their best receivers on my linebackers, where as if you had defensive assignments, you could put and keep your best corner on their best receiver all game.	2015-08-26

This title comes with the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection for PS3.  As great a collection as it is, this game should never be a part of the Metal Gear canon.  The overall level design strategy is god-AWFUL.  I didn't find the gameplay too challenging, but I threw in the towel when I had to fight the tank in the desert.<br /><br />Apparently, the only weapon that can destroy the tank are mines.  I had 10 mines on me, and they weren't enough to take it down.  You REALLY think I'm going to go back through allllll those rooms and look for a supply of mines??  You gotta be kidding me!  They could at least have some mines to raid out of a truck at least 2 or 3 screens away!  But nooo....  The best part is that mines are the ONLY weapon that could do damage to the tank.  Grenade launcher?  Nope.  Remote-controlled rockets?  NOPE....not even those damage the tank.<br /><br />You would think that the people who developed this game could reasonably assume that other heavy-duty weapons other than mines would damage a tank.  I'll say this....if Hideo Kojima had ANY part to play in this game at all, he really should be ashamed of himself.	2015-08-26

I have been searching for a good wireless headset for the the past two and a half years, and have went through many headsets, ranging from $300-$500.  I have been looking for a quality headset that could be used for games and movies, and had the following features: wireless, quality sound, surround sound, and mic.  The funny thing is that I found everything I needed [for my PS4] for $80.  There is no doubt that the best headphones/headsets are wired stereo cans.  However, having a console setup can get complicating due to wires and the need of a headphone amp if plugging cans via the PS4 controller.  This is where the preference of a wireless headset comes in.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality Sound for movies and games<br />No bass distortion<br />Hidden mic<br />Surround sound (best I've heard for a console; PC users - look into Sennheiser PC 363D)<br />Game/chat volume adjustment<br />Simplest setup (just plug in USB receiver; no cables needed)<br />Wireless<br /><br />Cons:<br />None at this point<br /><br />This review is not about saving money, getting the best value, not spending too much money, yada yada.  This is the best headset [for a console] that I have owned to date.  For those of you wondering what other products I have used, please see below.<br /><br />Astro A50's - Sound quality is horrible; I went through 6 devices and 5 of them have been defective.  Don't buy into the hype.<br />Turtle Beach Elite 800 for PS4 - Good features, but the max volume is not loud enough.<br />SteelSeries Wireless H - Great features, decent sound, but bass is distorted.<br />Sony MDRDS6500 - Distorted bass, surround sound is not great.<br />Sennheiser RS 195 - Great cans for movies, but no surround sound, and the enhanced sound modes are too quiet at max volume.<br />Shure SRH1540 - Amazing headphones, just not for consoles as they are wired and have no mic.<br />Sennheiser PC 363D - Hands down, best gaming headset I have ever used for PC.	2015-08-26

I thought Epic ruined Gears with Gears 3 and Judgement but this one really takes the cake. Why couldn't they just have upgraded the graphics and brought out the same game. The coalition and the entire gaming industry has been influenced and ruined by the Call of Duty series. Why make these games all like Call of Duty? For money yes. Dumb gamers love to just shoot and hold the trigger (lancers). Great gamers love a challenge like using a Gnasher shotgun but even that was ruined. In Judgement it was a marshmallow gun. In this current installment the hit detection is awful. I guess I'll just say goodbye to my dream of a Gears of War 2 without host because they would just ruin that to. I gave over 60 days of my life in game time to Gears 2 but after this awful showing I will not be buying a Gears gane again. They had an entire beta to realize the mistakes but what mistakes they did fix were small and irrelevant. Get back to understanding what your real Gears gamers want and have been asking for don't try to conform to the rest of the crowd.	2015-08-26

I use this for my PS4<br /><br />It is an excellent product. The sound quality is good considering the price.  I rated it 4 stars because I don't understand the product completely. Especially when it comes to BassImpact and VSS. For the base impact, when I play Call of Duty, it is so sensitive in a way that it vibrates to every sounds, which it leads mo to discern the source of the sound. Even if I set in the lowest setting. This is when I put in Shooter mode. Another thing when I turn on the VSS, I feel it's the opposite. I feel the sound is more surround when the VSS is off. I don't know if the problem is me or the headset.<br /><br />About the quality of the material, it seems fine and looks sexy. People say they break easily. I can see that if you don't take care of it.<br /><br />I wish they add more features/presets in the headset companion app. Also, anything that would indicate if the VSS is on.

I was originally turned away by the 'Copy/Paste' scandal of 2013. I now forgive them. Billion dollar deadlines can do strange things to people. In fact, after recently purchasing a used copy on a whim, I think this is the best overall game in the series. Does it have interesting characters like Captain Price? No, but Captain Price was recycled from CoD 2. Are there hackers in multiplayer? Sure, but not as many as there were in MW2. Ask yourself what you expect from the series. To me the answer is: &#34;Six hours of fast-paced bang-bang action and ridiculous set pieces in a semi-post-apocalyptic setting (or at least a really bad neighborhood, or airport), including helplessly getting knocked to the floor by a random explosion, followed by 20-1,000 multiplayer hours of getting sniped by twelve year-olds hopped up on Mountain Dew.&#34; Nowhere in that description are exo-limbs, super jumping, laser rifles, or Kevin Spacey running for his life. This may be the last Call of Duty with normal jumping. Think about that, and also realize that the Hardened Edition is only $26 and includes $50 in DLC (the codes still work). It's a great value, even if you're paying for recycled materials. Besides, what were you expecting?	2015-08-26

NATER-VISION	I was really hesitant to buy one of these, not because I was worried about losing a few bucks, but because I was worried about stripping off my old NES head wires (like so many other people wrote about in their reviews). ZERO issues with that, and I have a bunch of Japanese imports with the odd shapes and slightly different mounts... No problem at all.<br />  Every single of my NES games works perfectly, which was a shock to me. My original NES only just recently stopped working (still the most solid game system ever built&#62;&#62; they don't make 'em like they used to!) and I went several years without playing my old vintage games. My kids had NEVER seen them! They instantly got hooked on Legend of Zelda, which thrilled me to no end, and we had to resort to thumb-wrestling to see who got to take first turn.<br />  The system works perfectly for both platforms, but as I usually do, I HAVE ONE NEGATIVE THING TO SAY<br />  The controllers that come with this system are garbage. I still gave it 5 stars because I was able to play every one of my NES games (some of which I had gotten at garage sales years before and NEVER played!) But I had the fortune of still having my SNES controllers from my original SNES (SNES controllers work both platforms on this system, so you don't have to switch out). If you don't have SNES controllers, you might find this system a disappointment. If you do, you're gonna love this thing for a long time.<br />  Thank you, Retro-Bit, for giving me my childhood back! (Even if it made me remember what a nerd I was) (was?)<br /><br />Let me know if this review helped you. Thanks! -Nater	2015-08-26

This game totally reminds me of those books I read as a kid. You get to choose how the story unfolds...  I picked it up yesterday and played all night! This game sticks you in a horror movie. You have the ability to control the different friends in the group, as well as really put your personality into the game by choosing what happens next. I think you will really love this if you enjoyed games like Heavy Rain or Beyond: Two Souls.The graphics are awesome, the story is so much fun, and you are in full control.  I can honestly say this is now my favorite PS4 game. The Last of Us Remastered has been bumped...  SURVIVORS: Sam, Emily, and Jessica  UPDATE: 8/28/15 I'm a woman, played this game by myself, and I live alone. BAD IDEA, lol! I was so scared to fall asleep last night after I beat the game. I would say it gave me a good 10 hours of gameplay. I started again this morning and I'm trying to make some different decisions to really test out whether or not if your choices change the outcome. I have stumbled across a few new scenes, as well as found a bunch of things I missed the first time playing. I'll write another update after I finish.  SURVIVORS: Chris, Ashley, and Emily.  FINAL CONCLUSION:  I think this is a solid game that gives a good scare. I think people misunderstood when they pitched the game as having total replay value because the story changes. The plot of the story doesn't change. However, the way the story unfolds does change. For example, Mike died early on in my game during the first time I played. The second time I made a decision that kept him alive a little longer. He ended up dying a little bit after that, but it was a totally new death. I'm assuming if he survived past that he would have another chance to die again later in the game. I understand what they meant now. Another thing I realized is that Emily is like a cockroach. You just can't kill the girl, lol    WOULD I RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND: Hell yes! I already have a friend that is borrowing it, and another 2 waiting for him to finish.	2015-08-26

The sound quality is amazing.  I felt like the game I was playing was a brand new game.  I wasn't too fond of the name at first because I don't smoke and I'm not into the whole 420 thing, but it is the best looking wireless headset so that's what made me buy it.  I contacted Turtle Beach to see if this has the super human hearing feature and it doesn't.  It still sounds really clear.  I posted that it wasn't good for music at first, but then I looked at my computer's sound preferences and the slider was moved to the right.  When I centered it, the music quality is great.  Made me change from 4 stars to 5.  Now I love this headset even more.  For the price, design, and it being wireless. This is a good buy.  I bought the Turtle Beach stand to go along with it too.  Some things I would change up.  1.  Change the model name (420x).  Not all of us are potheads. 2.  Add the superhuman hearing feature  That's about it.  I'm happy with my headset.	2015-08-26

I picked this up at a thrift store for $1.50 cause I had just purchased a Genesis. I thought the small size would be perfect for when my girlfriend comes over since she has smaller hands and might find the regular Genesis controller a little big. I also just always like having spare controllers and for a a buck fifty, I thought &#34;sure why not&#34;. I don't know what the quality of these are supposed to be like, but I've been using it for a few hours on my model 2 and there's nothing wrong with it so far. People saying theirs crapped out on them maybe just had bad luck? Idk. Other than that, I'm not a huge fan of the XYZ buttons. They're like rubbery and feel flimsy, but I probably won't be using this exact controller for a fighting game anyway so its not a huge issue for me. If anything changes I'll change the review, but for now its a decent spare controller for people who wanna play with a smaller controller.	2015-08-26

I'm not a big fan of on line games, There is only one I play and I play that as single player.  However, I love Skyrim, have it for the 360 and pc and have been playing it since it came out.  My husband and I both thought the online game sounded interesting so I picked it up.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that we can't use the 360 controller, which we do with Skyrim.  I can use the keyboard, just don't enjoy it and my husband says his fingers are too big  and has no interest in using one so we have the game and I started it but stopped after about an hour.  I even tried a couple of control software but for us, it's not as much fun as just playing Skyrim.<br /><br />If you like on line games; using a  keyboard; and you enjoy Skyrim, you will probably enjoy it.	2015-08-26

Mario is awesome and brings back so many memories from when I was a child. This set comes with the little black box for the games, then built-in games as well, and Super Mario 3D world, all in this $300 bundle. The console itself is not very big, sits above the Xbox One perfectly on the left side free of the vents. Has two buttons for turning on/off and then the game eject. The red little light tells you when it’s off, and stays that way until you turn it on, then is blue. The console is only compatible for the Wii U games only. Which you can find used ones at GameStop for a great price. The console isn’t very heavy at all and can be put anywhere since its so little and long. The sensor for the fun active games is just a long bar, that’s flat and sits on any surface or unit nicely, and the cord is long.<br /><br />Now the game pad that comes with it is pretty awesome, I so myself. My 5-year-old loves the game pad, you can play the games on it, instead of using the TV, so you can play on the game pad while I watch my shows. Its got volume control on it, its touch screen, the sensor goes pretty far from the console, so you can sit anywhere you want when it’s fully charged up. As long as you stay in the same room of the console it will work. When the game pad dies, plug it in, you can still play, and the cord is pretty long so you can sit comfortable.<br /><br />I got some extra pieces for the Mario Kart racing game, with the steering wheel, makes the game more fun as always, we got the Mario and Luigi remotes as well. Then Mario Party 10 as well. 10 is a ton better than the previous 8 ones. All in all this is a great bundle set, and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. Its fun for all ages, adults and kids. They offer a wide collection of games for it, old school, and new games. The unit can be put away nicely in an entertainment set or stand perfectly for easy access. The system hooks up to WiFi, and the built-in games are kinda cheesy, but some are pretty fun. If you’re looking for a system that’s easy and fun, and not to complex this is up your alley. You can even hook up Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Instant Video on it as well.in games are kinda cheesy, but some are pretty fun.

Since it has a DRM scheme where you never get the whole game on the DVD and must download the last part. It's like that $#it program Steam for console. Because of this and lack of control over internet usage  and lack of consideration for bandwidth usage it is a massive hog of bandwidth. I moved to console gaming after years of PC gaming because you can't truly own or trade your pc games anymore. I was very disappointed after owning the 360 to by this poorly designed system with little flexibility and control. Today's DRM schemes are just an inconvenience for honest consumers. I hope there stupid move to this DRM scheme costs Microsoft. I sold mine and got a PS4 that I am much happier with and can play games off line and video quality is better.<br /><br />Also running the cable box signal through the Xbox is krap. I have a 56&#34; 1080 tv and there's a notable drop in picture quality to 720 quality or less. Why even put in the option if it doesn't work well. Like Microsoft has done with Windows releases in the past, this console was not fully developed or thought out. Way to go Microsoft you did it again.	2015-08-26

I think the game mechanics are that of the original but polished in all of the right places so you don't get stuck to walls and maintain very fluid gameplay. There are still some bugs that I'm sure we could do with out, but at this point it's only been out a day... Campaign is instant nostalgia, my only problem is that back when the game first came out the graphics were &#34;amaze-balls&#34; and today I play the remaster expecting more from the visuals, which in reality are a huge step above what they were and actually look pretty awesome. I suppose I'm just jaded... I have been playing The Witcher a lot. Still a bunch of blood, viscera, and chainsaws. Also if you play it before December you get download access to all 4 original Gears titles which you can play on Xbox One. Definite buy for Gears fans.<br /><br />The 4 out of 5 is due to the current buggy nature of multiplayer,  underpowered shotgun, and price. I think $30 would have been fair considering if you already have the other gears games you won't need the digital downloads offered later.	2015-08-26

Not just for xb1	TLDR: The ear pads are glued on and not replaceable with aftermarket pads. I found this out the hard way. I could actually see the lining and the glue seams inside my right ear pad when it came unglued after using for a few hours. Pretty disgusting to charge folks 300+ for something that has glue and plastic. Sound was great, the parts surrounding these cans not so much.  Initially, I got this headset and within 3 days I wanted to return it because of the odd way the pass through works with wireless chat on xb1. Now I have changed my mind because I can use it for wireless 7.1 simulated DTS sound, but not chat. I changed my review to 4 stars because of this caveat. The headset does clamp down somewhat, but noise cancellation and great earpads are help that negative portion. Also, the material is loosening up after a few weeks of break-in time.  First, the look of the headset is definitely in that high end category, it's made to last. The second major thing is sound and of course the sound is incredible. I have other headsets like the g930, hyper X cloud II, px4, Sony golds, and 420x for comparison. This one has much better surround sound with the 7.1 DTS by far and of course the Bluetooth capability to listen to music or take a phone call AND hear game sound at the same time is awesome imo. The sound is also crystal clear with balance throughout the sound field. Also the bass is pretty darn good as well. The presets are many and are customizable via apps or pc downloads. There are over 16 presets set as default with the ability to customize to your liking.  The saving grace of swallowing a 300 dollar price tag is I found a way to make this headset work for my xb1, ps4, ps3, and Xbox 360 after a week and a half of finding the right toslink splitter. A toslink matrix is needed to pull this off. If anyone is interested in that, please leave a comment on this review. Needless to say I have wireless game sound on all 4 consoles and wireless chat on the xb1. I have not tested if I can use wired chat with the ps3 or ps4, but generally sound is the same on XB1 with optical out. The sound was so good that if I couldn't use the optical out then I was definitely not interested in a 300 dollar DTS headset only for one console. My main issue was that I wanted to play MGSV on PS4 and Fallout4 on XB1 and have great sound with some versatility. Having the charging base as an active pass-through into a matrix solved that for me and I love this headset now. Being able to use an android app to control everything is also pretty nifty as well, which is also the only way to adjust the mic monitoring ratio.  Now for a few negative issues I don't like, but for the sound quality I'm gonna live with. -battery life with noise cancellation active is lower than anticipated, less than 10 hours. -cannot use chat features on other consoles, but can get DTS 7.1 on PS4, X360, and PS3 once passed through a toslink matrix. -headset can hurt your ears after a few hours until broken in fully. -will need a tablet or smartphone w/bluetooth to fully adjust mic monitoring because of the supported Bluetooth app that Turtle Beach has. -some people may not go for the hidden mics because they are not as good as boom mics, but I was told that over my xb live parties that I sounded fine. Update this headset with the latest firmware from day one to avoid any issues. -the price is hard to swallow, no questions about that. -volume levels for some people may not go high enough. I factored this into the fact that it can go uncomfortable depending on the presets, games, or apps being used. For my usage it is very adequate.  Finally, I do think for all the features, great DTS sound, and presets that this is worth the asking price, at least once I got the pass-through working. There are other options available, but this thing has superior sound over pretty much anything I have used up to this point. EDIT 09/10/2015 rating down to 2 stars... I had to file a return on these due to theright ear pad coming unglued. Yes, I said unglued because you are stuck with those ear pads on the elite 800 and 800x. Its a shame because I wanted to put some HM5 replacement pads on these. This was my last run at a Turtle Beach product. Throwing down 300 dollars plus for glued ear pads is not for me. For 300 bucks, go grab a Astro Mixamp Pro and Sennheiser G4me Ones or Zeroes.	2015-08-26

It's not bad, the Smash Run is the best part of the game as it alternates between platforming and combat stages, but the game just feels like a bad port of the Wii U version in most aspects. For one the stages are smaller and the graphics are pretty bad. Online is also horrendously laggy at times which is what really kills it for me. When I do have a stable match it can be a lot of fun but overall I can't shake the feeling that this was a lazy port job to cash in those who wanted the game as early as possible or didn't have a Wii U.	2015-08-26

I never fully got the chance to play Majora's Mask on the N64, so this was a great experience for me. As a long time Zelda fan, bringing games like &#34;Ocarina of Time&#34; to handhelds instead of remaking them on the Wii U, was frightening. I thought it would take the quality of the game away, but I was wrong... It brought a new light to the game, It LOOKS GREAT IN 3D absolutely amazing! And the graphics are basically just like the old N64 ones but sharper, so it's not like you're playing a COMPLETELY different game. Recommend it for Zelda Fanatics.	2015-08-26

This is a multiplayer review (didn't play the campaign yet)  The game is feel is EXTREMELY CHOPPY ! From moving around the map, to picking up weapons, to fighting other players, complete chop.  Hit registration is really really really bad.  Players standing still (not playing), and it took me 3 gnasher shots for an instant kill.  I've fired boom shots directly at 2 player who both walked away unscathed.  In game chat was broken, had to go to a private chat, and you can't invite friends from within the game into lobbies.  It's 2015 fix the hit registration, no one wants a game where the out come is random.  The most disappointing thing about the game is the fact there's ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARY REPORT after rounds.  So when a match ends there's no game summary report card.  You have no idea how you, your team, or the opposing team did.  This is a must have in today's online multiplayer games.  Just like the MCC I get all hyped up for these re-masted games and I am left feeling disappointed.	2015-08-26

Was unable to adjust volume balance to hear party chat well.  Volume maxed out for chat (chat +/- buttons) on headset but even with volume knob for game sound turned all the way down there was still game sound that drowned out party chat.  The headset adapter allows for much better level control but causes intermittent controller disconnects.  Microsoft really screwed the pooch with their headset integration with Xbox One.  It was a great idea to integrate the headphone/chat feature into these new controllers but with the lack of level controls I was unable to get the chat volume high enough to hear my teammates screaming at me to stop fiddling with my controller/headset.

I'm a casual-heavy gamer and I read a couple good and bad reviews, and I have to say the problems that some people were having with theirs didn't happen to me. As for those that have the little rubber pieces on the analog stick come peeling off, I highly recommend that you buy grips because my original black controller(which I kinda messed up the L3 button by pressing on it WAY too hard) rubber pieces never once showed ANY sign of peeling. I bought my grips from my local GameStop for about $2-$5 and they are pretty good for the quality.

However, makes you look like a mega-nerd wearing a hat with a visor clip with 3 reflective tips on the bill.  Make sure to lock your doors and board up the windows when using this.  You DO NOT want people seeing you wearing and using this.  That would almost guarantee you living a life of loneliness and solitude.  However, that may not be a bad/big tradeoff since you can play Euro Truck Sim 2 and War Thunder and a variety of other &#34;vehicle&#34; type games with full control over looking around.<br /><br />But really, don't get caught wearing this.<br /><br />10/10 product.

How hard is it to actually take care of your customers? We spend hundreds on a device from you, and you do everything to avoid helping your customers out. I can promise you that this will be the first, only, and last device I buy from microsoft.<br /><br />I have owned the XB1 for about 4 months.  Starting about a month ago, my controller started to not sync with my xbox.  I did all the troubleshooting MS and youtube could come up with, and it worked for a bit, but as the problem got worse and worse, I requested an exchange of the controller.  Keep in mind I have been in contact with the company since the start of the issue, within the 90 day warranty they set for all accessories that ships with the console.  They did everything to push me out past the 90 day warranty with troubleshooting that they now refuse to replace my controller.  I now have a $400 brick.  Yay me.  If you want a device backed with great customer service, avoid the xbox one.  MS does not know how to support its customers in any semblance of a good way.	2015-08-26

If you need a 360 to Xbox One adapter cable to replace the cheap one that comes in the Microsoft kit, this is perfect. Great quality, would buy again.<br /><br />Edit: After about 8 months the wiring started to short out and no longer functions correctly. I am very hard on cables and I tend to wear them out quickly, so 8 months isn't really that bad. About the same as I get from quality braided cables that come with high end head sets.

This headset's design is defective, probably by choice.<br /><br />They skimped on the plastic quality and did not reinforce the sides properly. If you use it completely normally, never drop it, treat it with perfect care, it will break. Just above the earphones, the plastic cracks if it is only stretched slightly (by doing what we all need to do to use a headset -- put it on), and will eventually break through completely.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- the speaker and mic quality are wonderful.

If you've never played Dishonored before or haven't bought any DLC for the 7th gen system, buy it, hands down, no questions asked. If you bought it and the accompanying DLC for 7th gen, hold off. Here's why: (Full disclosure: not very far into the game but far enough to compare it to the PS3 version) With Borderlands: The Handsome Collection and the Shadow of Mordor, There was a noticeable difference in either gameplay (Shadow) or graphics (Borderlands), Dishonored has barely better graphics than the PS3 version and the gameplay isn't noticeably smoother either. While borderlands carried over their comic-book style graphics, they did manage to clean them up quite a bit, Dishonored didn't do that. As far as gameplay goes, the load times are quicker and that's where it stops. The biggest advantage you get is the DLC, that's what makes the game worthwhile to buy new.	2015-08-26

The graphics are phenomenal - better than anything I have seen in open world adventure games yet. The voice acting is superb, never cringeworthy and the writing is like some of the newer, better fantasy novel (think Abercrombie or Ryan). Music and effects are well chosen, and the storytelling interleaves with the more algorithmic contract missions very well. If I had to pick one attribute, I'd say that the pacing of the story telling and the way it's integrated with the progress of the game makes The Witcher III stand out compared to games like Dragon Age Inquisition.<br /><br />To reiterate my earlier warning - this game for better or worse needs you to be close to the screen - the UX is adapted for that, as are the in-game perspective and graphics. I started playing from the couch and didn't enjoy myself very much until I clued into the distance being a major factor.	2015-08-26

It has lived up to and beat my expectations and while similar games have been here before, none have come close to the creepy atmosphere and scare factor.<br /><br />At first, I was a little worried there would be far too much dialog and basically \\\"watching\\\\\" a game. However once the story is set and you are introduced to the characters, the game takes off and doesn't stop. This is an edge of your seat game that doesn't quit and you must force yourself to take a break. It is literately like watching a horror or sci-fi movie which you cannot wait to see what happens.<br /><br />Like similar games, the camera angles can be bothersome or annoying if you are trying to look in a different direction yet the camera forces you to look at what the game director wants you to look at.<br /><br />Over-all, it is a very smooth-running, great looking game. My wife and I stayed up all night playing it and tried to make the best choices in the game, however every choice has a different outcome. Some decisions we initially thought was incorrect, however it had a negative outcome.<br /><br />Great game, I see playing this at least 5-8 times as there are 8 main characters and there are so many options and outcomes.

Batman could not look any better.  His cape, suit, and the overly dramatic way he lands on the ground look great.  I felt like I was actually gliding around Gotham City.  Gotham City never looked and felt better.  You end up using detective mode for the majority of the game, but with all of the batman games it's not a big deal.  There is nothing like using detective mode and do a silent takedown of a bad guy.  Throw in the fear multitude takedown you feel like you're batman and that's a very cool thing.  I did find myself comparing this to Assigns Creed, which isn't a bad thing either.  You spend most of the time upgrading your suit, batmobile/tank weapons, and gadgets.  I found that some gadgets were'nt a big deal to upgrade.  I loved using the disruptor gun and upgrading my fear takedowns to the highest level.  I ended up having a love/hate relationship with the batmobile.  Driving the batmobile through the streets, running through anything on the streets collecting no damage to the car is a lot of fun.  Even the out of place batmobile to tank mode seemed odd for a batman game.  They were fun but also very frustrating when you had a missile lock on you constantly in the middle of a battle.  I would accidently push in the L3 a little hard in combat and the tank will go to more of a first person mode and totally create confusion.  Then throw in the riddler challenges that used the batmobile, began to become more frustrating than fun.  Then the car chases just became annoying.  But I still love the game.  My only real complaint is too much batmobile.  The control mechanics for the batmobile are totally messed up.  I shouldn't have to change the controller configuration to make the batmobile feel more comfortable.  The fighting combat is very easy to get used to and stealth is what batman is all about.  Then adding the joker, penguin, scarecrow, two-face, and other notable villians make this one a batman game explosion.  Whether you like the batmobile or not, this is a great game that sucks you into Gotham City.  With the batmobile being what it is in the game, I give the game a 4.5 out of 5.sion.

There is a lot more to this game than what I initially thought. All the great horror elements are here. Seriously, I don't want to say exactly what is encountered in this game, but it's a very satisfying survival horror experience with much more than just a killer running around slaughtering people. It is a very &#34;interactive&#34; game. I see other reviews comparing to telltale type games and Heavy Rain. This is absolutely true,  but in my opinion this is better on almost every level. Great graphics, great story, great characters, fantastic acting,  great horror, great game.  For the diehard survival horror fans, this game is not all that scary. If your looking for the scariest game ever, this is nowhere close.  But that is fine because it is still a great game that is both unique and cliche at the same time with respect to the &#34;horror&#34; genre.  Note: if you don't like interactive games that are very story driven then this might not be for you.	2015-08-26

There was no &#34;wrong decision,&#34; but instead, decisions that you would make for yourself if you were in the characters' shoes. I've gone through and played it twice already (and will probably play it numerous more times). If you're a lover of everything slasher/horror like I am, then this game is a must buy.	2015-08-26

First I have to say I love the original Borderlands and spent many hours playing it! Now for this version, I was not quite as into it. It was a fun game but for some reason it just was not as good as the original for me. I also preferred to play both via PC version. I am a PC gamer at heart and most of the time the PS collects dust. But it is worth buying if you are a Borderlands fiend like me. I think the original games characters and the whole experience is just too hard to beat so that is the only issue I have.	2015-08-26

While this remaster may not have the insane amount of content Halo:MCC has, it's still a very very well done remake. The graphics are solid and the framrate runs smoothly on both multiplayer and campaign. What makes this game stand out is the gameplay. In an era dominated by fist person shooters, Gears is a welcome alternative.<br /><br />Can't wait for Gears 4.<br /><br />Highly recommended to ANY Xbone owners.	2015-08-26

Of course it has great graphics and a horrible, nothing story. It is incredibly annoying to have the enemies know exactly where you are at all times, cover is non existent, the weapons are weak and you reload all the time. It is totally frustrating when the enemies hit you EVERY time!!! They never miss; whether they are shooting you, or throwing dynamite or fire bombs at you. Playing this game makes me want to punch someone in the throat!!! I am glad I bought this game used and not new for full price. This game wasn't worth the used price. If you want a good action shooter, stick with Gears of War or Spec Ops the Line. The Punisher game is better than this game.	2015-08-26

Better for solo play.	I wanted to give this a review, as I didn't find any reviews that talked about the things I cared about. Firstly, This is a very well built headset, it has some heft, and generally it feels expensive. The fit is pretty tight. I have a pretty normal head and these are tight: I seem to be able to go about 2 hours before I need to give my ears/head a rest because of the pressure. All the controls are on the ear cups - which isn't ideal but after a few days of taking off the headset to see what button to push, you get used to it. You'll definitely need the manual to learn how to dial em in. The sound quality is VERY good- there is no doubt they are one of the best if not the best sounding gaming headphones you can buy. Plenty of bass. The noise cancelling is average at best - it doesn't compare to my bose qc25's. There is no crackling or interference at all - mine are dead silent.  The mic situation is rather unfortunate - with the firmware update people can hear you just fine, but it sounds like you are far away from the mic. Not ideal, but it isn't like you cant be heard or have to yell like some people say on here. Now my least favorite part - the mic monitoring (aka hearing your own voice amplified in your ears to compensate for having the headset on) is AWFUL. Firstly, the mic monitor level can only be adjusted via the ANDRIOD only app - by default it is set to about 80%. Secondly, the level is never loud enough- with noise cancellation off you can hear yourself okay when the game volume is low, but if you want any volume it seems like there is no monitoring at all, and you end up screaming because you can't hear yourself. But wait there is more! If you want to run noise cancelling FORGET about hearing yourself: turtle beach won't let you adjust the level with this mode on. It is almost like talking with earplugs in. This was almost enough to make me return them in itself; seriously frustrating. If you play serious multiplayer - I bet this will be your sticking point.<br /><br />The main reason I am keeping them is the sound quality and the seamless bluetooth integration. It is awesome to easily take calls or listen to spotify while you play. They sound great for music and calls work great. The charging dock rules as well.<br /><br />good: Well built, Out of this world sound, bluetooth rocks.<br /><br />bad: Mic is average, Mic monitoring is terrible.	2015-08-26

Graphics are amazing, love that they used proven actors for the characters, especially the Dr. Butterfly effect has been awesome but I don't want to give away to much information. Would have gave this game 5 stars if it wasn't $60 as it's still mostly just a QT game but if it was $40 I would easily give it 5 stars. A must have game but if you're tight on cash wait for a price drop you won't regret it. Fun to play, easy to play, great teen slasher story.	2015-08-26

If you have ever considered buying an amiibo you should because it may hopefully change your's as well. When i first bought this i was skeptic that i may have to go and train it a lot and spend to much time on it but little did i know the full potential of the amiibo. When i woke up one morning i hear sounds of someone playing smash bros which i thought was weird until i realized that nobody was playing but yet my amiibo was fighting another cpu. Now i had not done this and neither had anyone else the amiibo had done this itself. Now i know what you must be thinking but its true the amiibo had turned on my WiiU at night and was training itself until morning so that it would be able to prove itself to me. After i played against it and sadly lost i knew that this amiibo was worthy. After beating my other amiibos i would normally set them on fire but not this one this was the chosen one. Ever since i woke up that morning my life has been different and i have kept my amiibo by my side. Once when i was walking down the street i was being mugged but luckily my amiibo came to my rescue and 1v1'd the scrub and may have even saved my life. Believe me if you have ever considered buying an amiibo you should because yours may one day save your life.	2015-08-26

Sadly, the 'dedicated servers' aren't that dedicated in this game. My review is strictly the multiplayer because the story mode, if it's like the original Gears, is amazing. My friends and I are already level 24+ on the first day of release. That's how we game. With that said, the shotgun is all over the place with consistency. Some games, I'm popping heads off with a shotgun from far, almost like a sniper. This is both good and bad. Good for me obviously but bad for the balance of the game. I should not be able to do that. Now here's the flip side. Sometimes I'm on top of a guy, as he's picking up his teammate and nothing. No hit marks, no nothing and I get instant killed. Microsoft is probably releasing this game so they can get more people excited about Gears 4 because there's no reason to re-release a classic game besides money and momentum. Sadly this is slowly becoming a shell of Halo: The Masterchief Collection - full of problems. Microsoft needs to address this ASAP cause I'm slowly getting fed up with HMCC, this, the Xbox One party issues, etc. The Xbox 360 is more stable online than this.	2015-08-26

I just completed the game, and I thought I would post a review for all. It took me a total of 6 hours and 23 minutes to beat the game. You can go back and replay the game for different out comes. The game has the best graphics I've seen on PS4. I thought I was playing a movie and I thought it was amazing to view. I think the game was great, but the current price is too much. I rarely replay games once I beat them. I have so many games that I need to play. I would suggest getting this from RedBox and try it out. I paid 3.00 to rent it, and beat it in one day. If you don't have a RedBox wait for the price to drop to 29.99-39.99. It was a fun game. I jumped many times in a game and I never do that. Like I said it could have been a 5 part series like Life is strange or the walking dead. However you don't have to wait months and months for the next part. Hope this review helped you all and enjoy the game. :)	2015-08-26

Do not buy for more than $10-$20.<br />Pros:<br />The facial animations<br />Environmental details<br />Sounds<br />The beginning - Chapter 5, good pacing<br />The mystery/the build up<br /><br />Cons:<br />Josh is the guy in the mask<br />Wendigos are real and ruined the game for me<br />Josh being the guy in the mask, and pulling pranks ruined the game for me<br />Interactive movie goes on for way too long, and I had to force myself to complete it<br />A lot of padding to justify $60 price tag<br />Hannah being a wendigo<br />Josh's insanity is annoying, it gets on your nerves after a while<br />The characters movements, they are very weird. Especially in the beginning of the game, very jerky and spastic<br />My biggest complaint is Emily, her character is absolutely disgustingly detestable to me. From the moment she lied to matt to go hug up on Mike and got jealous at Jessica she ticked me off bad. She is an absolute Witch, and you know what I really mean. I can not stand her. Her voice grates on my nerves. No one character in history has made me want to track down and punch the actor in the face like Emily. She is nagging, annoying, bossy, and witchy. Matt could have done way better than Emily.<br />The events of the past were annoying too, they were just static and the same few seconds over and over minus nearing the end.<br />The totem aspect should have been left out of the game.They were too easy to find, and you would have to constantly check them so often to remember what to look out for. The game was too huge for the totems to be used properly.<br />For me the replayability is not there. The story is not good enough to make me want to sit through it again to see the different outcomes. Maybe see the different outcomes on youtube.<br />The wendigos look like Jack Skeletons from the nightmare before christmas mixed with Gollum from Lord of the Rings<br />Josh becomes a wendigo<br />The last hour of the game becomes the last of us esque while retaining it's weird interactive movie mechanics. I honestly did not like it<br />The cheerleader from heroes does not get naked<br /><br />I would really recommend this game for $10-$20. This game would have been better as a slasher version of Heavy Rain. But there is no real slasher killer and the goofy wendigo creatures are off putting. You know what? Just watch youtube walkthroughs, don't waste your money unless you are super rich and can do that. Save your money.

You simply need to plug the puck in via usb to the PlayStation and go to &#34;Settings&#34; then select &#34;Devices&#34; then set your input device and output device to &#34;USB Headset(Skullcandy GMX Stereo Transmitter)&#34; and make sure that you also set &#34;Output to Headphones&#34; to &#34;All Audio&#34;. If you experience issues where you have these settings selected and you are still getting no sound, then pair the headset to the transmitter again and you will be fine.<br /><br />As far as performance, this headset is comfortable, sounds good for a stereo headset and best of all is wireless. I can walk around my apartment and out into the common hallway between apartments with no loss of signal. Battery life says 15 I haven't tried to run it out, but I've gotten 8 solid hours with no issues on the weekends.<br /><br />Mic is a little picky in terms of positioning. Quality in terms of how it sounds but sometimes picks up breathing etc, it could definitely use a boom Mic foam cover thing.	2015-08-26

The graphics look great on the campaign mode---if you're just standing there. As soon as you begin to move, it's readily apparent that there hasn't been much of an improvement at all---it's just as clunky and jerky as the original, nearly unplayable. in fact, Gears Ultimate Edition (groan) gave me one HELL of a headache after the first two levels. 30 fps? More like .003. Ray Harryhausen would have laughed his rear end off.<br />So they say the &#34;Versus&#34; Modes are at 60 fps. All right. I gave that a try, but by gosh and by darn, you can't play this game alone, in your house, by yourself, with bots as adversaries---not for love or money. You're now FORCED to wrangle a bunch of friends (none of mine were stupid enough to blow over 300 bucks on this lousy excuse for a console, so that leaves me out), or sadly and pathetically join a bunch of fifteen (or less) year old strangers on one of the Coalition's precious servers. No bots! No Horde Mode! None of the satisfaction that comes from beating the computer's brains out!<br />  I realize not much of the last paragraph will mean anything to the average gamer, their only source of meaningful social contact being electronic gizmos and do-dads. I'm still of the old school---video games are things I do on my own when it's late, and I'm too lazy to do the things I ought to be doing. This ain't one of those types of games. I thought Gears 3 had some issues with the campaign, but at least you could see what was going on, the enemy died when you shot them, and Horde and Team Deathmatch could be played pretty much under any circumstances. I played in the Beta for GOWUE, and I had a feeling it would be like this. I sure wish I'd found a way to borrow one first. I'm ready to throw my Xbox One out with the morning rubbish. I've owned it since April of 2015, and there still aren't any good games for it.<br />  Geez.	2015-08-26

I purchased this starter kit to show my support to the company that made the game. This kit provides you with a decent starter tank, which can be used to train your crews for other German tanks for free... as well as earn you silver at a faster rate. You also can purchase another premium tank with the gold you get in this starter kit. 200,000 silver is more than enough to purchase your first couple of low tier tanks and slap in some supplies. I suggest playing and leveling up your tanks to get a feel for your playstyle, then purchase another premium tank. If you're gonna use the gold for premium time, I suggest choosing days which you can really devote to playing this for a long time. You quite literally get 24 hours from the time of purchase.	2015-08-26

Still one of the best games to play but just not amazing like ME 2.  The characters in this game stink compared to ME2.  The interaction and dialogue of characters is poor compared to prequel as well.  The places to visit are more limited.<br />Felt like a rush job.  Even gameplay and controls felt downgraded.  I did not mind the ending choices, but it did get pretty weird with the little kid theme and it finding out what the reapers actually were (or controlled by) was really anticlimactic and corny.  Having to play online to get enough. Is soon ready points to get best endimg was gimmicky too.<br />Ashley sucks and she should have been vaporized by at least ME2.<br />Not having Legion or a Krogan as a playable character SUCKED!  WTF?  And needing to buy DLC to get the Prothein (who stunk anyway) was crap.<br />Pros:  Seth Green. Edie is cool. Garrus.  More shooting fun and it still gets pretty intense and fun.  It's better than 85% of gsmes out these days.	2015-08-26

Great product. This product has a Fan,  two chargers on the stand, and two extra hub USB ports. You plug the stand into the PS4 and push the power button in the stand.  This starts the fan and the power outlets. Putting the charger on the charging stand was a little tricky. It's hard to see and I didn't want to push too hard and break the controller or the stand. Once the controller is on you are good to go and it starts charging. The fan seems to be working and the PS4 internal fan doesn't seem to come on as much anymore while the stand fan is on. The only downside that I have seen is that the stand will not turn on or charge anything while your PS4 is in Rest mode. You machine has to be in the on position for the stand to have power. Great product and worth the money.	2015-08-26

More realistic football situations are included this year -- ie. penalties, big time catches (focus is definitely on WR/DB matchup).  Graphics (particularly player face scans) & overall presentation (more realistic crowds) are also slightly improved. If you're a die hard football fan, then upgrading to Madden 16 is worth it due to it's upgrades /improvements.  Worth noting that Prime members get $10.00 off ($49.99).	2015-08-26

I personally loved sonic before this game, but this game made me love it more.  Its not like the original Sonic games on Nintendo and such but it is very fun and enjoyable.  Story mode is enough to keep you busy and interesting enough to keep playing.  You play the Hero side (sonic, tails...) or you play the Dark side (shadow, eggman...) and even after you finished both stories, there are still lots of add one and things to try to unlock and some are so difficult it gets frustrating, but I enjoyed trying.  My favorite part about this game was Chao world.  Chaos are super adorable creatures that are like babies that grow and you take care of.  You power them up, evolve, race, do karate matches, and more.  If you have two different memory cards and have a sibling who enjoys the game as much , I suggest separate accounts on different memory cards.  That way both players can train and have competitions against one another with their chaos.  Not to mention reaching &#34;immortality&#34; is time consuming but it's worth it to have that neat looking immortality chao in your garden. Even now, when I'm older, I still enjoy it when I have time.<br /><br />Over all there's a lot to do in this game as 1 player, but I feel like they could have done more for 2 players.<br /><br />Games i personally recommend for those who have GameCube would be:<br />Sonic Adventure 2 battle<br />Super Smash Brother Melee<br />Zelda games (i got the Legend of Zelda collectors edition that includes ocarina of time, majoras mask, adventure of link, and legend of zelda)<br />Mario party<br />Mario Kart Double Dash<br />Kirby Air ride (unexpectedly fun with someone else to play with)<br />Luigi's mansion	2015-08-26

I had some trouble figuring out what to do, so hopefully this will help some out there looking to buy this.<br /><br />I have Windows 8.1 and did not need to install any drivers. I just plugged this into the USB port on my computer and the green LED turned on for the device. I got my Wireless Xbox 360 controller and powered it on using the X in the middle. Then pressed the &#34;connect&#34; button on the receiver, which then started blinking green. Then I pressed the &#34;connect&#34; button on my controller, which is the small button between the right and left shoulder buttons on top of the controller. Then a few seconds later the top left LED on the Xbox controller X lit up and I knew I was connected. I had a little prompt on my PC about automatically installing the drivers for the controller, then it was done. I fired up GTA 5 and it works flawlessly.<br /><br />For those of you running Windows 10, I believe this receiver  does not work. I think you need to buy the new Windows 10 wireless receiver here - http://amzn.com/B00ZB7W4QU<br /><br />And if you're running Windows 7, you may need to install drivers by either going to your Device Manager, Xbox 360 Peripherals, Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows, and right clicking and selecting Update Driver Software. Or manually install them from Microsoft's website - http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows	2015-08-26

Keeps controllers charged and system cool. Great quality!	This console stand and charger is exactly what I needed to keep my entertainment system area tidy and clutter free and our PS4 running at optimal performance. The cooling fans are not any louder than the one I have for my laptop and do a great job at keeping my system from getting hot. It's super convenient for having the controllers right where we can find them on the charge station. The blue leds look nice and the stand itself is heavy and durable for being plastic. The price on this is AMAZING considering how well it's working!! I've been using mine about a week and I don't know how I lasted without it. I do wish the ps4 day tighter in the stand but it's not a big deal around my house. I received my stand free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this with my own ps4. I'm so super pleased with this stand!	2015-08-26

But, if you want a 'Ton of Games' at your finger tips with not enough room to hold them all on your current hard drive; get the DB and 4tb or higher. I got the 4tb on sale get deal.<br /><br />I just Beat Bloodborne, and I really wished I bought it on my HD because I hate switching disc. What had happen two weeks ago was I went to Play a game from a disc and it was the first time I played one from my DB. Keep giving me this Stupid Error Code about your disc drive doesn't work. So the safest bet on the PS4 is to Boot the system up in Safemode, then Reinitialize; 90% of the time its the right call, and its almost 50% of the time when you call PS4 support they'll ask you do this if the problem is that difficult regardless of the problem.<br /><br />It fix the problem, to my only other problem is I can't use Sleepmode. In standby for too long the console shuts off and and acts like there was a power outage; just play it safe and save a few bucks. Shut the console off completely and always take off that Auto Turn-off feature, I was at a point in FFXIV where I had to do a few things that took longer than I hoped and it shut off, nothing was wrong but the whole you disconnected the power  or whatever BS showed up and. It just scares me when I get that message. That reminds me of my days with Poke'mon where your save file was gone and you had to start over. I love'd my 47 out of 152  at level 99 game. FYI, (SMH) my goal was to get all 152 Poke'mon to 99.<br /><br />P.S. Still a great buy	2015-08-26

Maybe because I was playing this game on my 3DS, the graphic quality is horrible. I know Nintendo game consoles are not famous for their graphic qualities, but this is beyond bad. It is unacceptable.

In short, a lot of camera angles will make your character walk like a drunk man.<br /><br />Aside from that, I'm enjoying how little things can make an impact on the game. Without putting in any spoilers, the choices you make as each person effect how others see them. Mike's girlfriend will see him as a brave hero or a cowardly child depending on a couple of choices. Each aspect of a character has several levels, as well as several levels of their relationship with each person.<br /><br />I believe I'm in Chapter 4 right now, and aside from having to stop to charge the controller, I'm loving going back into the 80's horror genre, and can't wait to see how the opposite choices will effect my next run. Completely love the game, well worth the wait!	2015-08-26

The story and music helped a lot. There were some good battles and bosses but I found it pretty linear. Being a Bioshock fan, I craved more of an open world. There were a few side missions and puzzles but beyond that it was a very linear plan. I don't recall being as emotionally attached to characters or situations on other games as this. I found myself having moments that made the linear part disappear and make this more of an experience.<br />I gave it 4 stars because of that. Also smooth gameplay and good graphics. The weapon wheel was just a bit annoying at times. But overall, good game.	2015-08-26

UPDATE: The problem with this battery not holding a charge seems to have a lot to do with how you charge it. Simply charging it from the PS3 wasn't enough, it seems. Not sure if it was a voltage or amperage problem, but either way, here's how mine came back to life. I plugged into a battery pack [[ASIN:B00QOEVMPS Tzumi Pocket Juice 2200 Mah USB Recharge]] so I wouldn't be tied to the console. I noticed a few days later that the battery pack was off (does this automatically), but the controller was still on. It's been unplugged for several days now, and it's all good. Played several hours yesterday with vibe on and it's still on. If your battery has &#34;died&#34;, save your cash for later and hook up to something like a tablet charger or external battery pack.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Almost lasted a year (bought it 9 Aug 14). Was great for a while, then needed to be charged constantly. A month or two ago it died completely. It is WAY cheaper than buying another controller, so as unthrilled as I am to be replacing it already, at least it was cheap. I will be trying another brand, but I honestly expect the same result. Again, still much cheaper than the whole shebang.	2015-08-26

It looks like a real life broadcast and the beginning open sequence with the Steelers and Cardinals was a delight.<br /><br />The passing/receiving with the RAC, Possession or Agressive buttons reminds me of those RPG games where you need to press the right button at the right time.  It gets some getting use to but totally unnecessary in my opinion.<br /><br />There are ton of problems. I was playing Franchise mode, in the middle of the game when I was in instant replay, the game froze. It takes forever to just get to the start up page so best be prepared to watch the Beckman jr animations for a good five to ten minutes. Obviously there was a roster download error on day 1.	2015-08-26

Better off just buying an actual Xbox power supply rather than this knock off.   EDIT: We ended up using this  broken one a little while longer while we waited for a new one to come in. It blew a capacitor inside and fried our 360. Don't buy these unless you want to in the end buy a new 360.
