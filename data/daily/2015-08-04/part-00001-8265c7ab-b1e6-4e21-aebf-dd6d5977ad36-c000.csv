I was very surprised at the comfort of Riverberry Women's 'Olivia' Boot.  It fits perfectly.  I love that the zipper extends all the way down to the arch of the inner boot.  This makes it easy for me to get the boot on and off.  I have a rather high arch and sometimes have a problem with boots in this regard.  They are very pretty.  The gray is very neutral and can be worn with just about anything.  They seem to be very nice quality.  The buckles are even nice.  They height is great just below the knee.  I am 5'7 and they are just right, although they are so nice I believe they would look great on any height.  I look forward to fall and winter when I can wear these out of the house.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.  All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.	2015-08-04

He even walks home from school in them on occasion which is approximately 1.5 miles and says they are extremely comfortable.  Seven months later and with every day wear they still look like new!  Highly recommend.	2015-08-04

Like many soldiers he tried a handful of different pairs of boots over the years.  Five years ago he got these, and he wares them over 90% of the time.  He says they are the best and that includes every kind of action you can put them through.<br />A while back he got me a pair for my birthday, and I have to agree.  I've worn out dozens of work boots over the decades, and I have never come across a boot like this.  I wish I knew about them sooner.  I heartily recommend them for ANY work requiring boots.<br /><br />I won't rehash the specs; here are some personal observations.  They're very well-built, super comfortable, easy to get on and off, well aerated, protective of your ankles, have good traction even on wet grass, have self-cleaning soles, have a short break-in time, leather doesn't crack and cleans up easy, and they even look good.  What more could you ask for?  The quality of this boot shows years of improvements.  If you are comparing it to Rocky's Lightweight Commercial Military Boot, this one is better.<br /><br />Looks: got the sage green ‚Äì looks great with camo pants, but my son has the desert tan/coyote brown, and it looks good too.<br /><br />Size and comfort advice<br />For instant fit, get your correct SHOE size, not larger or smaller.  I read a lot of posts here on Amazon to figure out the size and got different answers, with some people saying to get a half size larger or tad wider, but others  saying to get the correct size.  Correct is correct, but . . .Here's what I've learned to do with boots and work shoes over the past four decades.  I always get a half size larger and add an insole.  Not one of those big thick ones, just a thin to medium thickness one.  This makes the S2V as comfortable as the best tennis shoe and allows for future shrinkage over the years.  The ankle protection still works and so does the self drying feature.  Besides, 99.999% of  ware time does not involve getting them water soaked.  Even if you do, you're going to take your boots off, dump them, ring out your socks, and put them back on anyway if you have the time and a brain.  These boots are quick on and off.<br /><br />Only con<br />This really isn't a negative about the boot itself, but for the money, the standard S2V should come with a composite toe, or the two should be the same price.  I realize that the steel toed boots are not usually authorized, but composite is acceptable.<br /><br />I enjoy wearing these boots because I can trust them and they're very comfortable, and they remind me of my son when I put them on.<br /><br />Final comments:<br />They do not squeek as a few guys said.<br />Outdoor Equipped did a great job in fulfilling this order through Amazon.  They arrived sooner than expected, even with free shipping.	2015-08-04

These shoes are an amazing deal.  I bought these on a whim as they were the Lightning Deal of the Day and they appeared to be nice looking for another pair of shoes.  I wasn't expecting the shoes to be the high quality product that they are.  I feel like I stole these at the price I paid, these are genuine leather and they have a very unique sole made of dots that actually feel more supportive than your typical shoe.  The metal clasp completes the classy look of the shoe.  These look like your pair of $200 loafers but without the price tag and they offer the added unique and so-far better than regular sole made from the rubber dots.  If you have taste for shoes, you will love these and I am sure your hound will enjoy giving them a chew (better these than your $200 pair).	2015-08-04

Only thing is I ordered my normal size, size 7, and they were too small. You could see my big toe sticking up through the toe of the shoe. Remember when it says &#34;size 7&#34; the pointed toe is included in that, and since the toe is so pointed and narrow our toes cannot fit. I returned and re purchased in a size 7.5 and they're perfect! Easy to walk in and not that uncomfortable for around $25/$30 shoes! Definitely my favorite. Look even better in person! I would just recommend getting insoles for the balls of your feet, as with any type of heel :)	2015-08-04

[[VIDEOID:cc0d57b02d6b554dbfd99445ca2f867f]] These shoes are amazing!! I already knew to order a half size up which is perfect because they don't have size 8.5 anyway, so I got a size 9 and they fit perfect. When I first had them on, the arch support bump inside felt a little weird at first, but I got used to it after a few minutes. It is nearing the end of the day and I am in LOVE!! These shoes are so, so comfortable and fantastic. I might never take them off. They look nice too, unlike some orthopedic shoes. If you have a bad back or you are on your feet all day and they start to hurt, I'd definitely give these a try. I received these shoes at a discount as part of a promotion. I also posted a short video so you can see what they look like close up and what the inside looks like.	2015-08-04

They are still very supportive and cushioned, but the design has changed so that they fit differently. The tongue is now &#34;webbed&#34; or attached to the side of the shoe and this changes the overall fit of the shoe, making it tighter, closer fitting to the instep, and &#34;smaller&#34; than previous versions, or other models of Brooks. I bought mine at a &#34;running store&#34; (no discount at Amazon, unfortunately), so the sales person was knowledgeable, which turned out to be a good thing. I went into the store after a 3 mile walk so that my feet would be as big as they ever get (according to the sales guy).  He saw how the shoe fit me and brought me one full size bigger than usual and one width wider. He said it was &#34;just this shoe&#34;, which I believe, because I tried on other shoes in my usual size and my foot hasn't changed, it's the shoe. That said, the same support and extra cushioning seemed to be there. I left the store wearing the shoes and walked about 3/4 mile back to work-no problem, right out of the box, which I expect from expensive Brooks. So, I highly recommend the shoes, you just have to be prepared to need a larger size.	2015-08-04

The toe box is narrower than many athletic shoes, but the uppers are made of leather, and soon conform to your feet.  The soles do not offer a wide, supportive base, but that's one of the reasons I like these.  I feel like leaping and dancing, not jogging or clomping about.  I don't go running in these, just wear them around the house, shopping, and aerobics.  One thing I especially appreciate about these is the soles; they don't track in dirt and stones.  These are a lot more comfortable if you get a 1/2 size larger than usual.	2015-08-04

Size #1 Kids / Size #2 Adults / Size #3 Performance	Shoes	5	35	39	N	Y	They work as advertised, maybe even better	Zubits work fantastically! I have to admit, when I first bought them I was a bit skeptical as to their ability to keep my shoes closed, but after trying them I'm now wholly convinced that it is impossible for these to let your shoe come off unintentionally. I've walked, run, danced, hiked, and even rock climbed with these on my shoes and they've never even remotely given a sign of coming off. But, even with all that, they are super easy to put on and take off when you want them to. To put your shoes on you just pull a little on the Zubits to tighten up the laces, then touch the two sides together, and the magnets do the rest. To take your shoes off, you just step on your heals.<br /><br />Seriously, these things are great.	2015-08-04

This is my first set of &#34;orthotic&#34; sandals, recommended by my podiatrist. Pros: the lowers are great. Nice arch support. Cons: after wearing them for the first hour, I found that the leading edge of the top strap was irritating the top of my feet...kind of rough, and I was expecting smooth nylon like other sandals I've owned. I'm hoping they will break in. I'm not sure why the manufacturer chose the strap liner material they did instead of just using soft woven nylon like another popular sandal manufacturer. I ordered the D size sandal because my feet are a little wide. However, when I put on the sandals, I found them to be a little narrow, but again, this is my first pair of orthotic sandals,so thIs may just be the way they are supposed to be. They certainly aren't as wide as other sandals I've bought.  If you have wide feet, I would think twice.	2015-08-04

My only downside to them is that I prefer a slightly narrow boot and across the foot this boot is the width of my truck; which could be an issue when using a climbing stand. In the long run it won't be a problem but it's just a minor detail. It's honestly probably a good thing as I'll have more room to layer when it gets cold. None the less this is a top quality piece of footwear that I will be suggesting to everyone at my hunting camp.	2015-08-04

I don't think they look especially huge but I guess they must be since they don't fit  into very many of the industry standard sized boots.  I wanted something with a low heel and a little buckle accent and these seemed to fit the bill.  I agree with another shopper about the color.  They are not nearly as pretty in person....they look so shiny and kind of like a reddish-brown in the photo but when I took them out of the box I was disappointed to find that they were more of a flat, matte brown.  The buckle detail was also a disappointment.  I was expecting a beautiful, solid brass buckle but it is a cheaply made little aluminum buckle colored to look like brass.<br /><br />The boots fit well and even left me with a little wiggle room which is good since I always wear long socks with boots.  I would say that the quality of the leather is just passing.  It's not falling apart but it's not thick, heavy, beautifully made leather either.  The insoles are also very light and I know I would want to add some cushioning if I intended to wear them all day.<br /><br />I decided to send them back.  Even at $50 they aren't worth keeping.  I know I can find better boots to fit my amazing calves.	2015-08-04

But after breaking them in, they have conformed to my foot and I am surprised at the tiny, slippery and/or slopey things I stick to.  I've used them primarily in Eldorado Canyon, where it is mostly face climbing with a few cracks thrown in.  It's funny, some shoes I buy that are too small stretch out (i.e. FIve Ten Fox, overly so, i.e. Sportiva Mythos) but it is more typically the case that they still feel tight or even tighter after using them a lot (Sportiva Katanas).  I have also purchased shoes erring on the large side (Sportiva Miuras, Boreal Ballet Gold, these shoes) and miraculously they end up conforming to my feet and fit even better than small shoes, because it seems that  my feet swell after a pitch or two of climbing.  Anyway these are comfy for many pitches without taking off at the belay, and the laces are nice and don't slip, and best of all they perform great, I stick to rock I thought I'd slip from.	2015-08-04

They are adorable and the leather is SO soft. For a medium width shoes, these sandals seem unusually narrow. The band across the toes was tight and really swished my toes together when I walked. Also, the leather gets sticky if your feet get the tiniest bit sweaty and then it starts rubbing painfully on top of your toes. I tried to convince myself that the leather would stretch if I just wore them a little longer, but I can't justify keeping an expensive pair of sandals that currently are not comfortable and are rubbing blisters on my toes. I think they just aren't right for my foot, but great sandals!	2015-08-04

This bag is beautiful. I absolutely love the shape of it and it is not saggy or flimsy at all. The design is very well made and I have had several people compliment me on it already.

So they run big.  I read a comment to order 1 size down but i was hesitant and opted for 1/2 size, i kept them because i didn't want to send them back.

I am writing this review with the understanding that I paid $25.  Had I paid more, I would be more critical.  These aren't as comfy nor supportive as other Clarks I have had, and as other stated, it did take a bit to stretch out the top straps.  I didn't care for the green, so used a bronze sharpie and I think they are much cuter.  I wore these out of the box to a Royals baseball game with some tightness and foot swelling, but it was a lot of walking.  Overall, these are great shoes- it is tough to find shoes that look kind of cute/dressy that don't cause discomfort.  Worth the $.	2015-08-04

I have worn and walked in them, found the tabs above left/right of shoe is rubbing on my toes  which hurt a lot by the end the day. Guess I can't return them now but would recommend going up a size.

The shoe is amazing for daily gym activities and light running outside. I use it for Crossfit. My feet gets better support and chances of hurting my feet are very little as I am more grounded.

I was wrong.  The style of this boot is nice but the quality isn't there.  The leather is rubbery and not as thick as you would want a boot that you expect to last.  The fit is good on the heel but the toe area is wide and will get wider if these do break in correctly.  I bought these with the 30% off sale but still at 270 bucks, they are not worth it.  Rather buy some actual American made boots for a little more and get high quality, thick leather boots that will last 20 years.	2015-08-04

Comes across more like a cowboy boot from the front, which is sad because they appeared very futuristic/cyber-ish (which is what I wanted) online. The inside has this plastic framing to shape the shoe, but then only a very thing layer of fabric between the plastic and the foot so it creates pressure points. Glue was all along the seams, not neat at all. And the seams were wavy -- not neat at all. Its wide around the ankle and calf - great if you have wide calves, but even then it would bulge around your ankle like kids winter boots. The only good thing about this boot is that it actually has some tread, something I find lacking in a lot of women's shoes.<br /><br />I don't recommend them.	2015-08-04

I am very upset that steve madden discontinued these. Now onto the reason I gave these shoes 2 stars . . . When I received my package the box was completely tattered up, in small terms, the box was destroyed. The only thing holding it together was the bag that it was sent in. Also, I am usually a size 11 in womens shoes, especially boots. I ordered these in a size 10 for some reason just to see if they would fit because I loved them so much and by my surprise they were HUGE. It legitimately looked like I was wearing clown shoes. When I opened up the box I looked at the boots and they looked slightly worn . . . .even though the website claimed that they were new. They had some small scuffs, nothing too bad but they definitely did not look new. Also, there was a little part of the stitching on one of the boots that was poking out in the back. The heel of the right shoe was completely busted in to the point where they could not be pushed out again and the bottom of the soles looked like they had been worn indoors.  Really disappointed and will be returning these. I will be on the hunt for a similar style boot.	2015-08-04

I have owned several pairs of Ray Ban sunglasses and these didn't have the weight of my other pairs and the plastic felt flimsy and cheap. Not to mention the seams along the glasses that would normally be buffed out in the manufacturing process. The logo is cheap and glued on. I am really disappointed because I was expecting high-quality glasses that meet Ray Ban's standard, however, these are probably counterfeit.	2015-08-04

The patent leather looks terrific, and I love the tan leather accents. This shoe goes with everything and every color, plus the block heel makes them easy to walk in. They buckle on both sides - meaning there are two buckles on each shoe, on either side of the ankle. Thought that was a little strange, but I actually like the look. I like a bit of a chunkier shoe anyway, so it works for me. I've worn these with skirts, dresses, and pants. They are true to size.<br /><br />I have two minor complaints. The first is the extra seam near the toe on the insole. You can see in the photos, an extra piece of leather stitched to the insole. You can feel that when you're walking, so it's a bit irritating. It doesn't hurt or scratch, but it's noticeable. Also, the first time I wore them, the holes on one of the buckles tore - so that now the 2nd and 3rd hole has merged to make one huge (and now unusable) hole. But the price was fantastic, so I'll keep them.	2015-08-04

If you like orthotics (arch support- some ppl don't) these Vionics are unbeatable.<br /><br />I was last wearing Croc's, then stepped into a friends Vionics, my spine instantly aligned, I was sold right on the spot. I have 3 pair of Vionics I cycle and again nothing compares.<br /><br />Support mainly, then on top of it these are very well built, they will outlast any pair of Crocs/others and get this, the older they get the better they feel bc your weight increases the arch support by compressing the material. One pair I wear is an older Orthoheal, still going and fits best due to wear.<br /><br />Everyone I let try mine, or re comes to ends up loving them. Don't even hesitate on the price.	2015-08-04

So many people commented that they were slippery or too small.  I've been wearing them a week now, and I ADORE them.  Seriously, so so comfortable.  I can see where people thought they were a bit slick.  They had a bit of a slippery feel on the ball of my feet but that went away after using them half a day.  I suspect the summer roughness of my feet rubbed the sole enough to give them traction.  They're REALLY nice to walk in and support my feet well.  I think I have big feet and these fit perfectly.	2015-08-04

I'm a field tech for John Deere during the day and I farm on the side and I'm VERY hard on boots.I bought these in October of last year and I'm usually lucky to get a year out of a pair of boots. I've owned Ariat's, Rockey's, CAT's, Tony Lama TLX's and regular Justin's just to name a few. These are by far some of the best boot's I've ever owned for both comfort and durability. The leather is not separating at the seams and it's staying attached the sole with no hint of giving up soon. Now I know that comfort is something that different for everyone so what works for me may not work for you. I usually need a boot with good arch support since I have flat feet. I will say that these boots are all day comfortable for me which is great since I spend a good amount of time on concrete. I definitely plan on buy these again if my current pair ever finally decide to give out. However from the way they're holding up now, I don't think that'll be for a while.	2015-08-04

I am a nurse that works &#34;12 hour shifts&#34; (every nurse knows it is a rare occurrence if we get out in less than 13 or so...). We are not supposed to wear mesh shoes, but most nursing shoes are stiff and not all that comfortable for me. I have been wearing these for about a month now and they feel so nice! I do not have a high arch, so I am not sure how these would feel for someone who does. And I can't address longevity, but I have already walked about 50 miles in them, and they still feel great! They are very soft and cushioned (under the foot) with plenty of room for my toes to wiggle. They are SUPER light-weight and my feet stay cool. I was initially concerned that the top was going to be too tight, but they have been fine. If you are looking for a structured shoe, these are probably not a good choice, but if you want something &#34;squishier,&#34; these shoes are pretty great!	2015-08-04

First half of the first game was a bit tough because I knew I had to break it in fast. The ankle support was hard at first, as was the whole shoe. But as the game went on, especially in the second half, the shoe started to feel natural. The second game, I didn't have any problems. The only problem I have is the shoelace. The length is more than enough, but there are times in the middle of playing that I have to tighten it up or tie the lace all over again. I just have decided to double knot them. The shoe grips the floor great, especially on sudden cuts. Since I can't give a .5 rating, I'm giving it 5 to be generous.	2015-08-04

These shoes are ridiculously awesome! The most significant thing about them is that they have NAILED the business casual look. I've got a great pair of Cole Haan wingtips that were too dressy for everyday wear. Similarly, I had a pair of Rockport wingtips that were too casual. These get it perfectly in the middle and look fantastic whether worn with khakis, jeans or linen pants. The color and sheen is perfect. The detailing is perfect. The contrasting stitching is enough without going over the top. I get TONS of compliments on these shoes every time I wear them.<br />But when it is all said and done, ultimately a shoe is about comfort and function...and these excel at both! The kind of comfort we have come to expect from Sperry Topsiders is built right into this shoe. The arch support is sufficient and the heel padding is comfortable without being too 'mushy.' The simplest way I can say it is that these are my new favorite shoes. Buy with confidence, you will NOT be disappointed.	2015-08-04

Bought these shoes for a photo shoot only. White patent on black velvet. Shipped from China, they arrived exceptionally fast (two weeks faster than shown by Amazon). They are of decent quality but not great. Not sure how many nights out on the town they would survive, but these will likely never leave the studio. My wife said the fit was comfortable enough, and they are cute. The patent white is not perfectly smooth like it should be. The contour around the peep-toe is somewhat strange and little bit too high. The heel tips were installed crooked and had to be turned to be aligned properly. They'll do for what I need them for. Not sure how much real wear and tear they could take.	2015-08-04

I first ordered the Yara Womens sandals in Antique Brown Leather which I don't want to take off when I wear them, but when compared with these, the overall support is not as comfortable.

I still give them 4 stars because I believe they're great shoes, very comfortable and lightweight. I'm sure that they would be great for deck shoes or boating canoeing etcetera, it just didn't work for what I was intending to use them for. I never really liked AquaSox, and was looking for an alternative to those. I do intend to use them at a water park soon, and hopefully they will work well there.<br />The construction is 50/50. The front and sides seem well made and fairly durable, but the back is made of the same rubbery type substance as Crocs. I've never had Crocs so I don't know how well these will hold up. Also that croc like material in the back is very thin.	2015-08-04

I ordered the 11 since many said they run small. The 11 was somewhat larger. I exchanged it for the 10 1/2, its somewhat small, but better than the 11.<br /><br />I wear these on my boat, they stick to wet surfaces great. No black marking either.<br /><br />I wear these on the beach, sand will accumulate in them, but hey it's a sandal, not a flip-flop.<br /><br />One improvement would be for the back strap to be adjustable. When my feet are wet, its a little difficult getting these on. An adjustable back-strap would be good.	2015-08-04

I got these at a great price, so  my review reflects that I spent about $80, not over $200.  In that regard, these are great boots.  I found them a little snug in the width and loose in the heel, but that is typical for me.  Since they are leather, you can get them stretched a shoe repair store.  I didn't find them as comfortable and amazing as other buyers, but they look great and I can wear them all day on my feet at work.  Thinking about getting the brown pair . . .  hee hee	2015-08-04

It cam with a small handle that can be attached to use it as a clutch and another longer strap that can be attached to carry it on your shoulder.

They are extremely stiff and will take some time to break in. The lacing system really sinches down tight.  I normally wear an 11 in tennis shoes and stick with 11.5 in boots for some extra toe room.  These fit as expected with some extra room.  Overall I'm pleased so far.  I'm hoping to find a balance between the stiffness and comfort when they eventually do break in.  In my opinion these are not trail/woods ready out of the box.  Then first couple miles in these I was complaining cause of the lack of flex and stiffness. Again not fair to judge them right away as they just need some miles to break them in.  Also these were designed for rugged terrain.  Up and down mountains while still providing comfort and rigidness.  These Danners cover that design and concept well.  They are built tough and built to last. Quality is top notch.<br /><br />Also matches up well with Sitkas new elevated ii pattern.  That was another selling point for me.	2015-08-04

The product fit was perfect-- after about 5 minutes trying to get the boot on. There is no finger loop to help pull the boot on. Getting the boot on  was very difficult, to difficult with my high arch, to get on. The boot fits perfectly for width and length but getting on is a no go.  I so love these. Wish it was easier to get on.  They are made well with one flaw on the side of the boot that was noticed.	2015-08-04
US	17319140	R3SX1RAKP33Z9L	B00KWKJ0S6	568787621	Columbia Women's Kea Vent Sandal	Shoes	5	1	1	N	Y	My go-to Sandal	This sandal is VERY comfortable, and fits my not-so pretty, not-so-stable feet perfectly.  I've been wearing them for years, and they have unexpected longevity given that I wear them more often than not throughout the entire spring, summer, and much of the fall.  Most sandals don't meet my arch area comfortably and begin to grow uncomfortable within a half hour of wearing them.  Columbia Women's Kea Vent Sandals have never caused me discomfort.  They're light-weight and snug, as if hugging my feet, that offer a secure feel for my unstable joints.  As for the reviews about the sandal being on the narrow side, this has not been my experience at all.  I have flat feet (as in every step I take on wet pavement sounds like a suction cup releasing) and have never had a problem with fit.  I'm a life-long customer!	2015-08-04

Ok, here is my issue with The Boot To New York as a company. I originally ordered their Panama Fisherman's Sandal, great sandal, but too narrow and returned it. The Barbados Fisherman Sandal appears to be wider, and it is, however I think it is a little longer/larger than some brands I buy (e.g. Cole Haan size 12 or 12 1/2 Ascis running shoes).  Based upon the sandal's I have received, The Boot To New York makes a high quality product and though a little over priced, I would buy their shoes, my problem is there is no effective channel for customer service. Before returning their size 12 for a size 11, I thought I would give them a call and find out in inches how much shorter the 11 would be.  As much as I appreciate Amazon and there vendor's return policy, it still involves some hassle, and frankly part of the reason we buy things is to avoid the hassle. So I thought a phone call would be efficient way to obtain information before engaging in the hassle of a exchange.  At $275.00 for a pair of sandals you would think The Boot To New York might actually have a Customer Service Department that could answer a question. They do offer a email Customer Service response, I sent an email  and it bounces back with the following error:  ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----(reason: 554 5.7.1 Mail appears to be unsolicited -554 5.0.0 Service unavailable So no telephone number and bad email link.  Called Amazon and they gleefully offer me an email as the only means of contacting The Boot to New York company  Good product, non-existent, or no way to contact customer service, considering their price point and their probable customer base, not sure if they will survive in the long run; really too bad they make a great product.	2015-08-04

However, the tobacco Hope Flats I purchased in the same size were too small in that same size.  I then purchased  another pair of Hope Flat tobacco, one size up, and it felt much more comfortable.  I also put in a gel insert as I do not have good arches.  But the shoes are now comfortable, and I really love the look of a sandal but with a back.  I've purchased many reef shoes, and I wish this had the inner padding that some of their flats have, but I'm happy now with my choice for its looks and feels with the added padding.	2015-08-04

I purchased two pair of Men's Sanita clogs a little more than six months ago. The black patent leather pair is falling apart. This after alternating between my Merrell winter boots, Frye cowboy boots and Salomon running shoes from purchase until now. My point is I am no stranger to quality footwear. I have been wearing Dansko and Sanita for more than 30 years. These are the most crappy poorly Chinese manufactured shoes I haver ever seen. The outer sole on the left foot and right foot is cracked from instep to out. ¬†Also on both left and right foot the treads at the ball position and the outer heel of the foot is separating from the shoe. I spent nearly $200.00 for these garbage products and want my money back for the Black patent leather ones! The brown ones are ONLY in good shape because I have other brown shoes and I HARDLY ever wear them. I am a lover of good comfortable shoes. I buy 5-6 fashion shoes yearly. I only buy work shoes as needed. I should not have to replace these so soon. The first pair of Danskos I purchased I owned for 7 years. The second pair 9 years Seeing as I do have to replace them I will not be purchasing any more from Dansko or Sanita. Instead I'll have them custom made by Sven Clogs and get my money's worth. I will repost this problem everywhere I buy shoes where this brand is sold. In addition all my friends, family and co workers who are nurses, social workers, therapists, aides, drivers, doctors and officers who must wear good comfortable shoes will be informed of what a shoddy product this.	2015-08-04

This product shrinks about 4 shoes sizes if you leave them out in the hot sun!!! Yes it shrinks that much! I can't even get my foot into them now. This is about my 6th pair of Crocs, none of my other Crocs have ever shrunk, I leave them all in the same place on the patio in the sun when I am not wearing them. This pair must be a completely different type of plastic. I tried to return them and get a new pair, but this seller refused because I waited more than 30 days. This is clearly a product failure and it should be replaced or refunded by the seller. But I can't get a hold of them? and they have their Amazon site setup so no returns can happen after 30 days.

I purchased this bag to use as my personal bag for a flight. It was the perfect size. Pockets inside are a little small but they worked. The zipper pocket on the front is basically worthless it is so small. The other for pockets on the front were great, held my kindle, my headphones, tissues, Dramamine, etc. Unfortunately on the first day the zipper on the main part of the bag came clean off. I was unable to close my bag the entire trip. If you but this bag I suggest you reinforce the zipper. The metal buckles on the side seemed to be straining a bit by the end of trip too but held up.	2015-08-04

I love the black frame  with the greylenses. In the sun there is adequate protection against glare without everything being too dark. By the way these are fun, comfortable, with slightly large lenses giving them that classic look. The glasses have Shatter proof optical quality polycarbonate lenses and Distinctive Ergonomic Ear Pieces which sits on the ear comfortably.<br />Wipe clean easily and have everything you expect from a decent pair of sunglasses plus they are so cute. I am really digging this style. They are polarized and protect against both uva and uvb rays. The bridge of the nose is comfortable and there is no sliding. I have a rather normal size head but larger ears so they rest comfortable without putting pressure where its not wanted.They are very retro looking also which make them so cute! All around this is a really great find!<br />I received these sunglasses in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-04

The shoe is too wide so my feet flop around inside although I bought a 9 and my normal size is 10.  Additionally, there is very little support--no comparison to the 4 pair of Tide II I have purchased and worn out quickly.  Also, they look very cheap, like something from the dollar store or Wal Mart.  So many styles I have tried are also too wide even when you adjust the strap to the tightest spot.  It seems that the manufacturer does not want to listen to all the reviews complaining about these same items.	2015-08-04

These shoes are comfortable and do feel just like walking on yoga mats. Unfortunately, I wore them one day around the house for a few hours and the middle toe piece came off making them unusable.

They were just too small! I've had other Badgley Mishkas before that fit true to size, however, I would strongly suggest going up a half size on these. The way the toe is cut and the narrow width at the ball of the foot causes the shoe to dig into the side of the great toe, which not only looks unsettling but is uncomfortable. Other than sizing issues, they were lovely.	2015-08-04

I also love that the sole of the shoe isn't loud or slippery -- whatever material it is made of is perfect for walking around a quiet work space with tile/hard floors.	2015-08-04

I wear an 8 in street shoes and 8.5 in running shoes.  I bought these in a 9 based on reviews.  I should have stuck with the 8.5.  Even though they are low, they are deep enough to fit my arch supports.  I couldn't get the laces totally comfortable for my wide feet.  The laces also have a rough texture which I guess contributed to the blister I got on top of my foot running 4 miles this morning.  I'm going to try replacing the laces and see if that improves anything.  They are very lightweight and look nice.	2015-08-04

No sliding around inside the shoe	I am a heavy person for a runner (208 pounds). I found these rather minimalist shoes to be very light weight with a nice fit. No sliding around inside the shoe. However, the inserts came out of both shoes on my first run and I had to glue them back in. I also found that the cushioning is very minimal on these shoes such that they are okay for short to medium runs of about 6 miles but there is insufficient padding for longer runs. I also ddi not find them to have a sufficient arch for me.  If you are a lighter weight runner they would probably be fine. Back to Asics for me though.	2015-08-04

So it was a surprised when he gave his approval.  He said for the price and the quality of the shoes, it's a good buy!	2015-08-04

I actually owned the exact pair but bought them at a high-end running store -- the ones where you go in and they watch you walk and then measure your feet and that type of stuff.  Anyway, the i got them for around $125 (if memory serves) and I love them!  I was so excited to find them here and the price is fabulous!  As for the arch issues, I have extra high arches and must put added support in all of my shoes, so it's hardly fair for me to say &#34;no&#34; but if I'm being honest, no, there wasn't enough support for me.  I would absolutely buy these again.  My podiatrist/ankle surgeon wears this brand and when he saw me with them he told me what a great and supportive brand my sneakers are.  There isn't a higher recommendation than that!	2015-08-04

I have requested a refund. Now I'm in the process of requesting the seller to pay for return shipping. I didn't bother to try them on. I was very disappointed in their appearance.

I opened up the box and upon being blinded by the shine of 300 dollar leather I don't even think I want to wear them anymore. It's like I want to hang them up on my wall and let poor unsuspecting visitors become both mesmerized and confused by the beautiful boots hanging on the wall.<br /><br />On a more serious note though, there seems to be a bit of misinfo floating around in regards to the sizing of these boots. I measure in at a true size of 10.5-10.75 toe, 11 Arch, and about a B Width and the boots from what I can tell fit for the most part perfectly, which makes sense given that I've always heard Danners boots fit true to size. I've seen a few reviews saying go a half a size lower, but from what I can tell, this would be completely unnecessary since the space between the toe to the end of the boot gives you just enough room to be able to go down a slope without slaying your toe. Couple this in with the fact that you're going to be wearing medium thick socks with these things and it's a perfect true to size fit. The only thing I would recommend for these boots is the gear you need to take care of them and some good Superfeet insoles since the ones it comes with are...lacking to say the least.	2015-08-04

They're super comfy and I can honestly wear them all day. They look great with a dress or with shorts...<br /><br />I marked them as somewhat small because they are a small size 7 (so if you're between a 7 and 8, round up) and I noted them as somewhat narrow as they are perfect for anyone who is looking for a narrow fitting sandal - but if your foot is medium or wider, these won't be comfortable.<br /><br />The only issue I can think to mention is that the band over the top of the foot is not over the arch, it's between the arch and the toes, so it slips off more easily than my other sandals. However, that's the only complaint I have, otherwise, these are lovely.	2015-08-04

I'm 7.5-8 and got the 8, they fit perfectly. There is not much arch support, so I have to use extra insoles for that.

The loops on top hold your foot in the shoe itself much better than the Classics or the Entradas, and they are comfortable even on my very high arch.

Size #1 Kids / Size #2 Adults / Size #3 Performance	Shoes	1	11	16	N	Y	Not worth the Hassle...unless you like semi-snug or loose-fitting shoes.	I had some reservations in the beginning. Could this product really work? Isn't it kinda pricey? I mean, really...$22 so I don‚Äôt have to tie my shoelaces. Really??? Then they were delivered.<br /><br />First thing I did was look for the instructions. Ha! There were none. No big problem. I just Googled ‚ÄúZubits Instructions‚Äù and there they were. But wouldn‚Äôt you think for twenty-two bucks there would be instructions? I did. Seems you would want your customers to be able to start using your product right out of the box. That‚Äôs just good business sense.<br /><br />If you think all you have to do is re-lace your shoes to accommodate the Zubits, you would be wrong. It is a trial and error fit and the instructions (now that I had them) even suggests you may have to tie, retie, and retie your laces again for the best fit.<br /><br />Finally, my shoes were laced into the Zubits and it worked as advertized...sorta. You have to be careful when closing the Zubits that they do not grab anything between the underneath side of the Zubits and the top surface of your shoe. The magnets are strong and if you are not careful, they will grab the surface of your shoe and not provide the needed magnetic seal.<br /><br />Knowing what I now know, I would not recommend Zubits...unless it is really-really worth $22 to you not have to have to deal with shoelaces ever-ever again. Personally, I think you are trading one hassle for another.<br /><br />====================== The Next Day ======================<br /><br />I tried them in earnest...REALLY. I figured if the Zubits would keep my laces from getting snagged when riding my bike, it might be worth the $22, but I never got that far. I took five steps out of the house and the Zubits separated. I reconnected the Zubits, took four steps and they separated again. I am returning them today. Too bad.	2015-08-04

I searched and searched for low boots like these- and was very happy to read the helpful reviews, so thanks to those who wrote before me!  I also ordered a HALF SIZE LARGER than usual due to the reviews and they fit perfectly.  I thought I would have heel slipping issues with a boot without a lace, but with insoles, they are super snug.  the finish does scratch easily, but as soon as you let that go, they look broken-in and well loved, in a matter of days.  they are beautiful, comfortable and a pretty hot performance boot.  I have had a hard time taking these off, even during summer!  they go with a bathing suit, right?  :)	2015-08-04

Here are my initial impressions:<br /><br />* Lovely to look at. There is a definite textural contrast between the suede panel at the ankle and the matte (almost distressed) leather around the foot. These are casual boots, to be sure, and should only look better through multiple wears.They will look great with jeans, leggings/jeggings, skirts, and just about anything except dress slacks.<br />* Slightly narrow. My feet are very average in width, and the &#34;vamp&#34; of the shoe all the way up to the toe box feels a little constricted in width when I wear my everyday (relatively thin) socks. The leather around the foot is quite stiff (suede around the ankle is nice and soft yet keeps its form), so it may take a while to stretch these babies out.<br />* Not excessively padded. If you want to feel like you're walking on a cloud, go for Clarks, Keens, or Merrills. These boots have a pretty firm footbed.<br />* Rubberized heel looks GREAT. From a short distance, it does look like stacked wood--up close, of course, the practiced eye can tell a difference.<br />* Other reviewers indicated that the boot runs large; I bought size 8.5 and found that the length is consistent with a Born 8.5, Clarks 9, UGG 9, and Keen 9.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and look forward to wearing these ankle boots from Fall into Spring.	2015-08-04

Thats why 'm still giving them a 5 star. I ordered a size 10 in womens and when i received them i tried them on, they seemed to fit. I wore them the next day because it was rainy and it seemed like a really tight fit and really narrow.  My daughter wears a size 8 shoe in womens and she said they fit perfect.

I picked these up because I wanted to take a minimal approach to footwear, but wanted something casual, that I could wear on a variety of occasions and not just for hiking and running. Especially, I wanted something I could wear working out but that I didn't need to change when I went to work (a semi-casual environment).<br /><br />These are ideal. They fit me perfectly. I wear a size 15 and sometimes shoes run small. These don't, they are just right. They are extremely comfortable. Like a glove.<br /><br />The Vibram soles are great for protecting my feet, without insulating them from feeling the ground. I can feel what's beneath me and adapt better to the ground.<br /><br />It did take some time to relearn walking with these. I found that in the first few days my right heel was a bit tender. Apparently I tend to put a bit more weight on the right side and on the heel. I didn't really feel that in &#34;normal&#34; shoes because of the extra padding they include in the back. With these I did and I switched back and forth between wearing these and my other tennis shoes until my gait had seemed to adapt. After several weeks of wearing these my walking style seems to have adjusted.<br /><br />These work especially well in the gym. I can't go barefoot since it is against regulations, but these are the next best thing. I do think that wearing these has helped strengthen the muscles in my feet and improved my balance as a result. So far, after about three months of wearing these, they have held up well with no obvious signs of wear. I'm quite happy with them.	2015-08-04

I put my insoles in these shoes right away, so the arch support is perfect for me. The golf shoes ran a little snug in the width just across the toes. I developed small blisters on the tops of my little toes after the first couple of rounds. I like that they are leather and seem to be loosening up. I'd give them 5 stars because they are well made, but the break-in period has been a little painful.	2015-08-04

I bought a pair of the Dual Fusion a couple years ago, and they're the only shoes I have that don't bother my heel spur. I purchased these because my other ones are getting worn out. They definitely do not have the same fit as they did a couple years ago. I noticed that they do not come up as high around the ankle like they used to. It is very easy to lace them too tight so the pressure on the top of the foot becomes painful.	2015-08-04

They hurt my feet in several places. The size was fine. I went down 1/2 size based on other reviews. The heel is quite high and it rubs. The right shoe hurts my foot close to where the bow is. Keds usually fit much better and feel more comfortable than this show does. I've also had good results with Grasshoppers. I'll keep these shoes and can hopefully break them in a little to make them more comfortable.	2015-08-04

This is a great price for an adidas shoe - but you get what you pay for.  Adidas' shoes always are tight in the ball of the foot due to their narrow lasts, but this is a more extreme case, likely due in part to the cheaper than average synthetic upper.

Shoes fit perfect with fuzzy socks and jeans! I'm a size 6 normally, and as stated in the description the seller tells you to order at least a size up if not two sizes up. I ordered a size up (7) knowing normally boots tend to run big on me. I love them, the boot isn't super shiny which is what I was hoping for, and my calves fit in them with jeans! I tend to have a major problem with that, but these sealed the deal, I even have a little more room to go if I unstrap the side of it. It's not raining right now where I am, so to make sure the boots didn't leak I just filled my tub up with water and splashed around a bit. I had no leaks but my feet did get a little cold, assuming it was just from the cold water in the tub. The boots are heavy, but that's expected since they're made of plastic. They come up to the perfect height for me (mid calf). The only problem I would have to say, is that they bend at the ankles, but I also have very small ankles and this happens to me a lot with boots, it's just I'm afraid they may crack around that area if I'm not careful.	2015-08-04

I purchased these to wear in the winter.  I normally wear a shoe size 8.5 or 9M .  The 9M fit me perfectly.  I tried them with socks and the my toes did not feel cramped.  The boots are overall comfortable and have a soft lining.  They are amazingly light weight, unlike many other types of winter pull-on boots I tried.  My jeans tuck in easily.  It is currently 90 degrees in Boston so I cannot attest to how the boots perform in wet winter weather or what it is like to wear them all day. I have rated them as a 4 because they seem to be just right so far.  I will update my rating after I've worn them in the cold sleet, freezing rain & snow.	2015-08-04

I bought these running shoes because I have issues when working out in regular width shoes and I wanted to see if a wide width would be a better fit.  So far, it seems liek the wide width is helping.  I have more room in the toe box and my small toes don't go numb when I am working out anymore.  The quality is as expected from New Balance.  I have been a fan of their shoes for awhile and I believe they are worth the price.  The cushioning on the bottom of this model is very thick and has a nice spring to it.  It doesn't show well in the picture, but the lower of the cushion is speckled white and purple.  Overall, a very attractive and functional shoe.	2015-08-04

Also, water doesn't drain out the bottom of the shoes, so you end up feeling like you are wearing buckets for shoes.	2015-08-04

My first son wore these in every size until he outgrew the available sizes and now my second son just fit into his second pair. I love the soft leather and sturdy construction. His last pair are still in good shape although due to his crawling they're scuffed on the tops a bit. My sister still wants them for her baby on the way though! These are such great shoes, even if they have scuff marks they look cute, fashionable and go with any outfit my boys wear. Plus they are great for babies first starting to walk. My 15 month old gets the perfect amount of support without stomping and clomping around in some heavy-soled shoes that make walking more difficult. Can't express how much I love these!	2015-08-04

Glasses that look as good as a name brand that rhymes with Day Fan, but at 90% less in price? Yes. Better. I have a pair of another model of Ray Ban, but they fell apart, and without strong evidence of a recent purchase, they provide absolutely no customer support, service, warranty or replacement. I thought about replacing them with an Aviator type. In addition to sticker shock, I saw that they did not even have a spring hinge. These do, and they are excellent in fit and quality.	2015-08-04

Semi-responsive in the forefoot and fairly cushy in the heel for this 155 lb guy doing 40-60 miles per week.  I am happy with these glides‚Äîthe first pair that I have owned‚Äîso far and plan on using them exclusively as a recovery day shoe since they are are on the heavier side relative to other traditional running shoes on the market.  I only have about 20 miles on them but expect to get at least 600 out of them if they hold up similarly to other, lower stack height Adidas shoes having the same adiprene/adiprene+ midsole.  Yes, these shoes have adiprene+ and adiprene in the forefoot and heel respectively, unlike what is listed in the product description here on Amazon advertising these shoes as only having full-length adiprene+.  Be sure to check shoefitr before picking a size. These are a half size larger than the couple dozen other running shoes I have owned. When it comes to other Adidas models, this holds true in comparison to the Boston 3s and 4s as well as Adios v1 and Adios Boost.	2015-08-04

These sandals are so comfortable, with enough arch support to allow you to wear them the entire day.  The straps are a bit stretchy which makes them stay on your foot comfortably, but also work over my high arch.  The big toe strap is comfortably placed and does not rub.  The heel is not too high, but nice enough to work with summer dress pants.  When I ordered them it appeared that the straps were almost a 'velvet' but in reality they are an elastic of some sort, but they have the look of velvet - a very dark true black.  Overall these Sketchers are super comfortable, and dressy enough to work for other than those casual occasions.  Sketchers seems to have figured out the combination of fit, fashion and comfort when it comes to shoes and I am a fan of their footwear.	2015-08-04

These sandals are very comfortable. The reviews stating they are comfortable from the moment you put them on your feet, are correct. If I were to find a small fault, it would be that the sandals are made for sidewalks instead of dirt roads. I live rurally and the dirt and pebbles really like to collect under foot. Other than this minor irritation, I would absolutely recommend these sandals. BTW, I think these sandals were made for the long haul and I expect many years of wear. High quality.	2015-08-04

The boots we use on a daily basis are probably 2 years old.  Not sure if a 13 in that model would still do the trick.  Seems odd they would change the dimensions of their sizes.	2015-08-04

I've worn a Nunn Bush Penny Loafer for years, and when it was time to replace, Amazon was my best option without setting aside an afternoon to go shoe shopping.  I was able to order using the old size, and was very pleased with the fit.<br /><br />I felt like I was taking a bit of a chance, though.  Amazon had the size listed as &#34;2E&#34;, and I need a wide width.  Previously I had a &#34;3E&#34; and it was the correct fit.  I did some research and found that Nunn Bush only makes the standard and 3E widths, so I took a chance and figured that Amazon has the sizes posted incorrectly.  This seems to have been the case, because they fit like my old pair of 3E.	2015-08-04

It smelled terrible when it arrived, but the smell disappated in a few days.  It was a little more casual looking than I wanted, but it was an excellent price for real leather.  It was slightly smaller than I wanted, and I would have liked it better if it were slightly deeper, as my sunglasses case was a tight fit.  What I did appreciate were the many pockets for organization (though a bit too flat to fit much), the not-too-big size, and I loved the long adjustable strap.  If you don't carry much and don't need to fit a large sunglasses case, this might be perfect for you.  Overall, I recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price.	2015-08-04

The only other Reefs I have had lasted 8 years of fairly regular use. I decided to replace the worn out Reefs with some new reefs.

I can confirm that they fit well right away (no irritation around the toe strap or anywhere); they fit well (just a tad narrow but I have wide feet); they are very comfortable to walk in (I walk 1-2 miles at a time in them, plus around the house, yard, and doing errands); the arch support is adequate (I have a medium to high arch) and they have a subdued style. I hope that they last 8 years!	2015-08-04

They aren't as ugly as some people make them out to be. I wear a women's 6-61/2 and ordered the 6 in kids without thought. When I got them, they were wayyyy to large for my liking. Some people like to have a little more room for more coverage around their toes so friends told me to get a 5. However, I went into a shoe store to try the women's 6 and it fits perfect since kids and women's are 2 sizes difference. Thus, I have just ordered black ones in a size 4 kids and I can't wait to wear them! Will do a better review once they are here!     Update: I just got the correct paid for me and I wear these shoes so much. I have taken a showe in them too because the straps form better to your foot when you do. These babies endure a lot. I will say that my foot odor was noticed when I took them off, they aren't great for sweat feet but at least My feet don't slide around when I wear them. When I go to the river, rocks get stuck between my foot and the sandal causing annoying pain but other than that they are excellent. The arch support is strong and sometimes I will whine about little aches around the area and also where it rubs the inside of my foot but on the bottom of my shoe, it says &#34;no whining&#34; so I have tried to get over that. Since I have only had them for a few weeks, I expect for them to be totally broken in and great because they already are comfortable. I hope this was helpful.	2015-08-04

My only big issue with it is that it is really big and because it is a soft material with no hard edges or lining, it is always so hard to find things. It is floppy and I will literally be digging around in all the pockets for like 5 minutes before I can find what I'm looking for. It sounds silly but it is quite annoying. Other than that I love this bag, it looks great, I've had it about 3 months now and it has held up well. The underside of the shoulder straps are turning black which I imagine is because I wear it on my black work shirts every day, but you can't see it unless you look for it so that doesn't really bother me.	2015-08-04

I think they have recently changed the construction of this item. It's been my go-to wallet for years. I just ordered a brown one and a red one. The brown one (older stock?) was much better constructed, and the red one had flimsy card pockets, as a recent reviewer said, and I'm returning that one.<br />As for the straps pulling out, I've solved this by putting silicone glue between the strap attachment base and the outside pocket when the wallet is new in order to stabilize it. Without this, the straps would pull out. I've communicated this to Buxton as a suggestion to improve their product.	2015-08-04

I love these shoes but they seem a bit wide at the heel.  The also rub just a little right below the ankle bone but I'm adjusting.  I have delicate feet and these are the best I've worn.  I walked an 8 mile trail yesterday without blisters or wear on my toes.  That's a big improvement over every other shoe I've ever worn.  I know I say they are wide at the heel but that has more to do with the structure of my feet than the shoe itself.  My feet are really narrow.  I have no shin splints at all with these.  I think I could even trail run a little in these.	2015-08-04

I give it a 3 star because they run small, like half of what you usually wear.  Which you should order half more. I got 11.5 and they're small,  I should ve order 12.	2015-08-04

I have been looking for good quality, comfortable and supportive summer shoes because I don't like to wear closed shoes in the summer. I bought these in the pewter which is a great color. These &#34;mostly&#34; fit the bill...<br />Here's the breakdown.<br />They offer just that.. Comfort and support. The heel cup keeps my foot from overpronating which most people tend to do in cheap flats. They are cushy and offer more than sufficient arch support. The wider straps also don't dig so overall it's a very comfortable, good quality shoe to wear. Although they are really comfortable, I did need a wear in period. My arches are &#34;normal&#34; height.. Not high and not flat and I found that the first few wears my arches actually felt tender after wearing these because I'm not used to that amount of support in my arch. I wore them for a couple hrs at a time for a few days and gradually my arches got more accustomed to them and my foot molded into the shoe more. They do run slightly large. I typically wear sizes 7.5-8 and these fit perfectly in a size 7.<br />The reasons for me taking off one star...these are a little hot... I've noticed that both the insole and the straps get warm on hot days, and I end up sweating under the straps. They don't seem to absorb the sweat so after a while I start to notice it both under my feet and under the straps. The other thing is the price... Don't get me wrong, these are quality shoes... But they could still be just fractionally cheaper... $50 would a great price for these and I'd happily pay that for multiple pairs.<br />Overall, a really great sandal.	2015-08-04

The color is neutral without being brown or gold/bronze so I can wear them with more things.  They have a nice arch support which I need.  The very flat sandals are not comfortable to walk in for any amount of time.  The Velco adjustable strap works beautifully since my left foot requires a tad more flexibility.  These sandals are very light, comfortable, and attractive on the foot.  I wear a 7-1/2 in an open shoe and size 8 in a closed shoe. I would have preferred a half size larger, but the size 7 fits well enough and is still comfortable.	2015-08-04

I ordered tts, after looking at these shoes on multiple sites, coming to Amazon since I was confident they would ship the authentic shoes. While they fit great from heel to arch, they were much too wide and long from arch to toes. The band across the top was too big to hold my feet in place, and I'm at least avg., not narrow footed at all. The inch plus of empty space from my toes to the ends of the shoes looked ridiculous. They looked like clown shoes, and were too heavy too lift my feet. IMHO, the base felt like I was wearing tire treads, but less flexible. Can't say too size down, because it all depends on heel length, the length needed to comfortably wear the thong, and how long your toes are.	2015-08-04

I love when you can get comfort and great style in one purchase.  I want them in more colors, I'd definitely buy them again.	2015-08-04

They are a little snug at the sides of my feet but are still comfortable. I like the style. They look fine with pants, but my daughters say they won't work with a skirt. But with a calf length skirt they are like a Mary Jane, a little European looking or Boho so I may try it. I'm happy with my purchase. I just wish I could find Orthoheel shoes in a 6 extra wide.	2015-08-04

[[ASIN:B004SI1QR6 Dr. Martens Vegan 1460 Boot,Black,8 UK (9 M US Men's/10 M US Women's)]]<br />I wear a range of shoe sizes; 8 US for running shoes without socks, 8.5 US as a safe option for online purchases and size 9 US for Nike SB Dunks. Since these shoes do not come in half sizes, I did a bit of research about what size to get. Hours of research was inconclusive and in the end, took a risk and purchased  the size 9 US. Was expecting them to be a bit loose and was pleasantly surprised that I found them a bit narrow. I think a bit of breaking in will fix the problem. To conclude, I think I made the right choice. Size 8 US would be too small and a size 10 US would be way too big. At any rate, these shoes look awesome and I am very happy with them.	2015-08-04

My feet are swollen and these leave strap marks if I wear them all day. I wish they sold an 8/9 size because I am an 8.5 and the 9/10 is too big and 7/8 is okay in the Luna model but too tight in this model. I will wear these but only for two to three hours at a time. They are the perfect color to match a tan or golden-brown skin tone. They are very comfortable on the bottom of my feet and I could walk for hours in these with no rubbing if not for that weird shaped strap on top. I still love the brand but just won't buy this model again. The strap around the ankle is great if you are at a festival, fair or just walking around to ensure they stay on your feet.	2015-08-04

The first pair I got were fine in length (just a touch short), but so narrow in the middle that my normal width foot was completely hanging off the footbed on the inside, by at least 1/2&#34;! I returned those and ordered a size up. They're just a hair too long, but wider so I decided to try them for date night. The total amount of walking we did could not have exceeded 30 minutes, spread over the course of four hours. By the time we got home I WAS IN PAIN. Even once I laid down in bed my feet still hurt.

I have had these for two weeks and I only wear them a couple times a day for about 10-15 minutes when I walk my dog. At first, I wasn't happy with the plugs in the soles because you can feel them, especially when walking on concrete. They hurt a little while walking the first day or two, but now I have gotten used to them and I barely notice them. Also, walking in the grass provides a better grounding contact, and doing this also solves the problem of feeling the plugs so much. I have definitely noticed a difference in my energy, my sleep quality and I have less trigger points and muscle aches since I've been wearing these. I'm going to buy a pair of the ballet flats next for the Fall. There are a lot of studies that have been done on the concept of grounding or earthing and these shoes offer a solution for people that can not easily go barefoot. Highly recommend these flip flops!	2015-08-04

I bought a size up. I usually wear a 39 in Dansko but I ordered a 40 and they are a little long, but the width is perfect and they are fine with socks of medium thickness.  I've had good luck and no so good luck buying Danskos online. I usually have no trouble with 39W but sometimes 39 fits okay, sometimes 40s are too narrow and too small. So I would tend to say these run a little snug based on the fact my normal shoe is 8.5 and I don't wear a wide in normal shoes, but have Danskos in 39, 40 and 39W and nearly all of them fit very comfortably.	2015-08-04

I normally run on Pearl Izumi EMotion N1 or Nike free 5.0 and I've bought this to be my recovery or long run shoe, but I was supprised!! It seems that the more you run on it, the faster you get. It is light, has a great response, great outsole contact, great grip, great fit and fast! It is such a versatile shoe that you can use for recovery as you can use for speed workouts. The only thing I would change a bit is the drop (6mm), something bellow 4mm would be better, but that is not something you would bother after 30 seconds running on it, but comparing to the others shoes I run, that is something I noticed. In my opinion, it has a good (not great) support on the arch and it doens't have that much structure for strong pronation. I would consider it as a neutral shoe. For more pronation support I would consider trying the New Balance 1500v1.	2015-08-04

I had to send these back and will be trying another waterproof boot by Merrell (going up a full size this time). Originally, I went back and forth between the buckle-downs and the captive launch (read about a problem w/buttons popping off) before settling on the captive buckle downs. I even ordered 1/2 size larger than my usual 7. It fits my foot just right (with the 1/2 size difference), however, everything else was really tight and stiff. When walking around the house, I felt like I had to stomp more than walk because the shaft of the boot was so stiff and unforgiving (maybe it would have loosened later?). It was also very tight around the calves as many other reviewers have stated. I was able to zip them up, but I know it will be an effort with anything thicker than leggings. Since these boots are for winter, I'm obviously going to want to wear thicker socks, thicker leggings, etc. Since they were already so tight, I imagined my legs getting more swollen if I were to wear them for longer periods of time. I've had this happen with another pair of boots I own (that I don't wear anymore) on longer walks, on planes, and it is so uncomfortable. I tried to convince myself to keep them, as I hate returning online purchases, but it was just a deal breaker all around. Hopefully, the next pair will be better!	2015-08-04

Need guidance from manufacturer on order to apply Garde and Conditioner.	When I acquired a pre-owned LV Cabas Mezzo I did a lot of research on products to protect the vachetta leather.  This bag has vachetta straps and a vachetta bottom.  It had already developed an even patina.  The bag was made in 2003, and kept in a dust bag for nearly the entire past 12 years.  So everything I report about my experience applies only to vachetta that already has some patina.<br /><br />There are many people reporting their experiences on The Purse Forum.  Among the many products, two brands seem to have the greatest following for treating and protecting vachetta.  There is that very expensive vachetta kit which has its loyal followers.  A tiny 50ml bottle of conditioner will set you back over $20 and even this brand has some users who are not happy about what happened when they used the product on new vachetta.  And then there is Apple.<br /><br />I have used Apple Garde and Apple Conditioner on other bags and after doing all the research I decided to try it on my new-to-me Cabas Mezzo.  I used the Garde first and then the conditioner.  The Garde did not change the color or texture of the leather at all.  The conditioner darkened the leather very slightly, and left the leather feeling smooth, and the straps were even more supple than before.  I am greatly relieved and completely satisfied at least for now.<br /><br />There are all kinds of warnings that you should not use anything at all on LV vachetta, and that LV warns against using anything.  And yet the vachetta is very vulnerable to water spotting and soiling.  After doing all the research it seems that the best approach is to use nothing on new vachetta.  Wait until the bag develops a light to medium patina, and then condition and protect.  The problem is -- what do you do while you're waiting?  Some people actually sun tan their bags for a few weeks.  My bag was stored away like a fine wine.  There really seems to be something of an advantage in acquiring a pre-owned bag if you can find one in great condition.<br /><br />It is curious that there is no manufacturer's site that you can find online, nor are there clear directions provided.  Which should be applied first -- the Garde or the conditioner?great condition.<br /><br />It is curious that there is no manufacturer's site that you can find online, nor are there clear directions provided.

I'm only giving these four stars instead of five because I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop (pun!). I had been avoiding getting a pair of Docs for years because I never like spending money. But after going through two pairs of sort of comparably-styled Candies in two years, I decided to spend the extra money in hopes of getting something well-made and long-lasting. So far (about 3 weeks), these took practically no time to wear in (contrary to other reports, especially about the leather version) and were pretty comfortable out of the box. I have all sorts of foot problems (plantar fasciitis, bunions, flat arches, wide fore-feet and slim heels, etc.) and have been able to put a couple inserts in these and make my feet a lot happier than they've been recently. I don't even care about taking them off when I get home and I feel like my back pain has also calmed down. Who knew proper footwear can actually do so much? (Answer: almost everyone. I just never wanted to believe it.)<br /><br />I'll table this review for after I've put some real miles in, but for now - I recommend.	2015-08-04

I'm ~180lbs, 5'8&#34;, and it is decidedly not all muscle. I try to run maybe a mile and half, three times a week if the weather's fair, in our outdoor riding (horse) arena; it's 1/10mi perimeter, and a mix of sand and gravel. So not much demanded, not much abused. The shoes were not a proper Size 9, but the fit was acceptable with thinner socks. And the tread is perfect for the surface - very aggressive. But the stitching is coming away at the toe cap, and so the upper fabric is pulling away from the toe. And, now... I'm back shopping for running shoes, again. And, no: I won't be using the Order It Again option for this item. Sorely disappointed.	2015-08-04

She got her first pair of Minnetonka mocs two years ago, when they fit her just right. They were light, soft, comfortable and had minimalist moccasin feel with thin rubber soles and hardly any padding inside, which was exactly what we were looking for in kids shoes. She wore her first pair for 2 full years, because the leather just kept stretching as her feet grew from size 2 to size 4. On the outside hey still look like they've only been worn for a month or two, not two years - that's how well they held up. The little rubber dots on the soles have rubbed off in some spots but they just look smoothed out, with no holes in the soles. Apparently the design has changed since then significantly. Here are the key differences we noticed:  *The rubber on the soles is about twice as thick, with ridges on the heels instead of dots all over. My 11 year old daughter only wore them for a couple of days and the rubber ridges and rim that goes all the way around the soles have started to shred in the heel area. *There's a stiff fat seam right in the center of the back of the heel, covered by heel flap. My daughter does not like it. *The insole is cut longer than necessary in the back of the heel and curls up slightly, adding more discomfort to the heel area. *The insole is not one continuous piece, but ends right before the ball of the foot. *The insole is thickly padded in the heel area, which, combined with the thicker rubber on the sole, eliminates the minimalist feel of the shoe. How disappointing. *The overall craftsmanship has declined, with less attention being paid to the construction of the leather upper. (see photo, fringe flap not secured at the edges, shoe rim is left unfinished near the fringe)  So all in all, this is not the same shoe that my daughter enjoyed wearing for the past 2 years. It feels and looks much cheaper, even though we paid less for it two years ago. The *feel* of moccasin is not there anymore, just the look. I'm giving it two stars instead of one, leaving some room for the benefit of the doubt in hopes that the shoes will soften up in the heel with a bit of time and wear. I will try to update the review once we see how the shoes hold up, although I don't have much hope for the shredding rubber on the soles. If you are new to these mocs, you probably won't know what you are missing, but if you are a return customer, like we were, I suggest you consider the changes in the design mentioned in this review.  UPDATE: reducing the review to one star. The dye in the leather bled all over my daughter's feet when she got them slightly wet, leaving her skin orange. The shoes went straight into donation box after that.	2015-08-04

They stay on your fit very well and don't slide around on your foot (I wear socks with mine).  Like other Rocky products I've had, these seem to be well constructed.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the Vibram soles slide on wet, mossy sidewalks.  I've had sneakers that do this too.  Not sure if its the type of rubber compound or what.  Overall good product and I would purchase again.	2015-08-04

I ordered size 8.5 which is my normal size but they were huge so I returned them and ordered size 8. The length is perfect as well as the width but the shoe arch support was between my arch and heel, so I added a gel arch and have worn these sandals all day. The straps are too short, need to be about .75&#34; longer.  Not worth $145, but I paid under $50 and they're worth that price.	2015-08-04

I always struggled putting on and taking off swim shoes and many seem tight, with a narrow foot opening...especially when wet.  These have a tongue, so it is easy to make the foot opening wide.  The shoe fell off once or twice but it was not a big deal.  There's an elastic cinch to make the shoe fit tighter.  The shoe seems sturdy so far with a nice rubber bottom.  We have had them for about 2 months, using them at a pool or lake at least once a week.  Nice bright color...we ordered fuchsia.  For what it's worth, my daughter is on the high end of the growth percentile chart...I can see a child with a narrow foot may have problems with the shoe slipping off more as other readers have said but can't say for sure of course.  It worked great for us!!!	2015-08-04

My mule looks best in black leather, so if I buy something for his saddle in a brown leather I count on Fiebing's to turn the leather a nice dense black. I clean the leather, layer this on, then after a few hours buff the excess off with a cloth. I even just now used it to dye the felt in a britchen, it sucked up a lot of it but did the job well. The leather will stay black for a long time, but if it gets worn, easy to give it a tune-up. Good to buy the version that includes the applicator, a puff of cotton on a wire. Makes the process just that much easier. But you CAN use a small brush for close work.	2015-08-04

Terrible smell	Just got them in the mail an hour ago.Will update in the nearby future. Normally sells for $70 but I got them for $35. Wasn't sure what to expect. I am very picky when it comes to clothes and shoes but thought $35 isn't a lot for shoes and I could always return them. They arrived on time, that's a plus. When I opened them I instantly fell in love with their color! A light tan but not plastic or cheap looking, very stylish to say the least and appeared to be top end. I had read the reviews about a foul smell coming with the shoes, Its true. Smells like gasoline or even burning rubber. Makes me wonder where they make the shoes or what chemicals go into the process, and their overall quality. I put them on and they fit perfectly. Comfortable as well. Look really sharp and modern, great finish to go with a fitted suit. I'm wondering how long the smell will stay for because it is really strong. Also the smell stayed on my hands which gave me a small headache. Would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the smell. But like I said I just got them today so I'll have to see if that become a definitive factor or not, cheers hope this helps!	2015-08-04

This shoe looks great on and has enough support and comfort that Im tempted to wear them out for a night. They run a little small though.

I bought my original pair of these same sandals probably 12 - 15 years ago and loved them.  I was so happy to find them again and am looking forward to wearing my new ones for the next 15 years.  I have very narrow, difficult to fit, feet, and NAOTs have worked out better than any other sandals I have had in terms of how they fit, how comfortable they are and how long they last. These new ones are a snugger fit than my well worn ones, but NAOTs form to your feet over time as you wear them.  They are comfortable now but I know they will soften up and feel even better after wearing them for awhile.  I have several pairs of NAOTs in different styles, and even though I try others out, I always end up back to NAOTs.	2015-08-04

Takes several days of shorter wear times in order to get your feet accustomed to the support. Vionic Tide 2 is wide enough for average to wider feet. Might feel too wide for real narrow feet. For those who love to throw on flip flops and go----these are perfect and provide support needed for walking around the town. I ordered a size 6 and they fit great! (I wear 6.5 or 7 for most shoes.)<br /><br />I also bought a different pair of Vionic flip flops that are a little &#34;dressier&#34;, with a buckle to adjust the width/tightness over the top of foot. They are a narrower shoe, but still fit my foot great! I typically wear a 6.5 or 7. I ordered 6.5 and they fit great.<br /><br />I will likely purchase more Vionic for fall/winter shoes!	2015-08-04

I wear these while working on boats and the traction is great on a slippery boat surface. My feet haven't been drenched yet but the small amounts of water that landed on my feet have proven the boots to be waterproof thus far. I originally ordered my usual size but they were a little big so I returned them for a 1/2 size smaller. Very easy return procedure.  Update:  I hiked in the boots for about 30 miles in difficult Utah terrain and the boots held up great. Very comfortable and the high top provided great ankle support. The non-slip traction on the bottom was perfect for slippery rocks; even at steep inclines and declines.	2015-08-04

(I like that they are a little wide because when my feel swell, they are still comfortable and not binding.)  I would say that the arch support is has a moderate rise.  I've gone for average to long walks in these shoes and my feet, legs and back didn't bother me.  The only issue that I have is with my left shoe.  The strap goes over the top, closest to the ankle, was rubbing in a very small spot towards the top / inside of my foot.  There isn't a seam in this spot so I'm not sure what is causing the irritation.  Because the shoes are otherwise comfortable, I just have to make sure that I wear a bandaid in that spot.  (Which you cannot see because the straps are thick and hides the bandaid).  I most likely will be purchasing another pair in another color.	2015-08-04

Well, I used to. Since I have been wearing these, I have not noticed an ache, pain, or cramp once.<br /><br />These shoes are light, breathable, flexible, but have incredible support and cushioning. I am honestly amazed at the amount of technology and design that went into these, as well as the superior craftsmanship. Honestly, one look at the seams on these and you can tell these are premium shoes.<br /><br />I had previously worn Brooks or Asics sneakers and Merrill books / hikers. Now I will be checking out the Ecco brand for all my other shoes.	2015-08-04

I recieved a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I LOVE these sunglasses! I have been wearing them everyday since I have received them and can't get enough. They look awesome and have the perfect amount of darkness in the lenses. They kill a lot of glare from the sun and make it so much easier on the eyes to be outside in the bright daylight.<br /><br />There's only one thing I dislike about the sunglasses. When I turn my head to either side, there is a pinkish glare that shines in my eyes from the red color tint of the glasses.

I honestly regret not buying two pairs. They are extremely comfortable to walk and run in. I was a little painful the first few times wearing them. I have wide feet and these shoes are pretty narrow. I wouldn't recommend getting a size bigger because after a few uses they stretch enough to accomdate. The shoes look great too; casual but still stylish for a professional look to go with chinos. I'm definitely going to get a second pair in the future.	2015-08-04

Great purchase!  I need a shoe I could walk around in at the various ports, get wet in and would be great for hiking as all of excursions involved various activities that included hiking, climbing waterfalls, an other exiting activities.  Not to mention, the colors were great as it matched well with my bathing suit.  I will say that after a few hours, they aren't the most comfortable shoes but they bearable and I still love them. As a matter fact, after we returned from our trip I put them away and forgot that I had done so.  One day the family put on their shoes and I went looking for mine and couldn't find them.  I thought that I had some how left them on the ship.  I was so upset but low and behold, i recently found them and they came in handy yet again.  I was so excited that I found them again.  Not as excited about the lack of memory but...here's to aging:-)	2015-08-04

High quality, great color, easy to clean, LIGHT to carry and LOTS of compartments that are sturdy and well thought out with heavy duty zippers - no cheap hardware. Beautiful wide strap, too, that makes it very comfortable to wear.  The ONLY reason this bag gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the photos show a wrist bag that is supposed to come with it, and which would be very handy to have. It wasn't included, though, which is disappointing.  I needed the bag that day so I didn't send it back - and really, wouldn't give it up for anything, anyway.  I look forward to my next Baggallini - hopefully with all pieces included next time.	2015-08-04

Out of the box, however, I was able to wear these all day with some shin strain (slipping) but no blisters.  I did need to routinely re-tie shoelaces so they were comfortable and so I reduced heel slip.  By the second day, they fit fine and I've noticed with 2 other pairs of Keen hiking shoes, that they may start loose at the heel, but that is quickly fixed as the shoe becomes more flexible when worn.  On another note and through personal experience, I've learned not to order a half size up unless I've tried the shoe on.  I wear a size 6 and these shoes fit as expected.  Two days of wear - no blisters and I'm very happy with them. These rank among the best of lighter hiking shoes I've purchased and I've been hiking for over 15 years.	2015-08-04

I wake up and i'm excited to go for a run in them. I overpronate and as such i used to have pretty significant problems with my knees and my hips after long distance runs. The Bare Access 3's have give me the control and the support to stop such a harmful way of running (although it did take some practice). I run in the shoes daily (I usually run about 21 miles a week but that fluctuates quite a bit) and i've had very little problem with them.<br /><br />However, i would not recommend these shoes for any other activity but running. I usually run to the gym, work out, then run back. But due to my weight lifting, pieces on the bottom part of the shoe are starting to come off. On top of that the very front part of the shoe (the plasticy bit) is starting to show some pretty significant wear. I got these for Christmas and I've only had them for about 8 months now so I wasn't expecting to see wear on them so soon.<br /><br />So, great shoes! Not for multiuse	2015-08-04

Obviously I was happy with the product and the changes were at least consistent, if not always improvements. This new version is built on a different last so the fit was not the same at all, so just ordering my usual size did not result in the expected fit (felt bigger, or maybe the same width but longer? definitely not the same). The quality/stability also seemed lower than earlier models in this series, although the breathable mesh form of the shoe is still there are a big plus if you play in hot weather. Anyway, I had tried another wide tennis shoe that fit better and this one did not fit the same as the same size in the prior 3 models (to my surprise) so I returned this shoe, with good support from Amazon.	2015-08-04

But, the fit is nothing like my Vionic Tide II sandals.  I ordered a medium width, but the strap across the instep is way too loose, making it difficult to keep the sandal on and my feet slide around when walking.  So back they go for a refund. The Vionic arch support has been the best fit I can find to help with fallen arches, but the cut of these sandals just didn't live up to the quality I find with the Tide II sandals. I hope they will offer some more styles and colors with the gems, which is why I considered these in the first place. I'm so glad returning them on Amazon was so easy. Soon after I printed out my return label and dropped them off at my UPS store, Amazon had already acknowledged a refund to my credit card. Thank you Amazon!	2015-08-04

Just got my Franco's today, and am pleasantly surprised with this pair too. I bought my first pair last year in another style, and they have been the most comfortable boots I have ever owned and got a ton of compliments on them as well. So I decided to update my black pair and after searching<br />last year and this year I found this pair in black, ordered them and again, could not be more comfortable. I'm a photographer for events and can be in boots for 4-5 hours straight in the field and never ever have a problem with sore feet. These fit as well as my first pair and love the look, the leather is super, they are not a wide fit but would have liked them just a tad tighter but these will probably fit well with any pair of jeans, not just slims. The heel is the perfect height and I feel these boots would well with my more casual skirts. Because of the thicker heel they may not be appropriate with a dressier dress but for causal they are perfect in every way. Love Franco Sarto boots.	2015-08-04

I know the style of shoe I'm used to wearing, but I decided to give these a shot because I hear everyone rave about Asics all the time.<br /><br />I'm going to lead by saying I don't blame the shoe I blame myself for buying a shoe with the type of support I'm used to (or so I thought) without trying it on ( rookie mistake).<br /><br />Worst shoe I've ever worn. I've worn Asics before but a different cut.  I wore them once and they felt OK.  The second time I wore them the insides of my feet and my shins started to absolutely kill me... To the point I had to stop mid run and walk back.  I then stupidly tried to wear them on somethin simple like an elliptical one day when it was pouring out and the results were more of the same to the point that my shins hurt for days afterword.<br /><br />Again, probably more the fact that it's just the wrong shoe for me, but I've never had a problem like that with any other running shoe regardless of brand.	2015-08-04

I don't mind so much, but I would have been happier with the color that was advertised to me: silver. My daughter says they're comfy to wear (very soft) and she never complains with soreness, but the outer material isn't exactly resilient. If the toes are scrubbed against a hard, textured surface, it will scuff pretty easily. My daughter is six and has learned to be more careful with her shoes, but it would sure be nice if she didn't have to walk on eggshells with these boots. If they were more resistant to scuffing, I'd recommend them to anyone. If you have a tomboy on your hands or a little girl who just likes to play hard no matter what she's wearing, I'd say look elsewhere.<br /><br />FYI: They are true to size and don't pinch at the toes. They fit well over a high arch. The skin scuffs, but doesn't seem to peel and get worse.	2015-08-04

I used this for my travel purse this summer. It was great for that! Plenty of room, had NO trouble getting everything I needed in it. Love that I can carry it crossbody or use the handles. Now, the leather on the handles doesn't stay in place but two minutes with glue and it's fixed. The pockets are convenient and it's great having one in the front and back that are zippered. The strap stayed adjusted where I put it even under heavy load. This thing got hauled all over the place and I've continued to use it after I got back stateside and it still looks as crisp and clean as the day I got it. The only reason I'm not still using it now is that the center pocket that is also a divider is floppy, which means driving in the dark and groping for something in your purse is going to be frustrating. The dividing pocket falls to one side and sometimes you can't find things. Things also gravitate to the ends of the purse. But overall? I'm keeping it! It is a really tough purse to have held up to what I put it through without so much as breaking a stitch.	2015-08-04

I didn't want super pink and the old Rose is still &#34;girly&#34; but not candy pink.

While I do not feel like these shoes work my calves as much as they claim to, or make a noticeable difference in my &#34;rear view,&#34; I can say, currently owning at least 12 pair of Fit Flops, that they are undoubtedly the most comfortable and my absolute favorite shoes to wear. I am 5'10, overweight and live in Florida, and I wear Fit Flops probably 96% of the time. Rain, shine, shopping, church....I've even worn them to hike on easy terrain. I am a solid size 10; have been for the past decade, and I can wear both size 10 and 11. I have never paid more than $50 for a pair; and usually catch them at Ross Dress for less for around $35-40. To me they are definitely worth that price. I love these shoes and will continue to snatch up every pair I see on sale; so if you  live in Florida and are a size 10...well, I'll race you!	2015-08-04

It's also a MUCH brighter orange than the original pair that came from Nike.  Everything else seems legit.  I'm guessing these were faux-pas shoes, in which case should've been WAY cheaper to purchase.  Aside from color differences, I'm hoping they have the mileage my other ones had!!!	2015-08-04

Edit after Disney: had to go buy new shoes after two days in these shoes bc these left my feet SCREAMING. And I have a high tolerance of pain. I should've ordered a size bigger bc I was blistered all by my toes and the back of my heels.

My Spyridon's arrived yesterday and I was super excited. I own a pair of KSO's ( size 42) and Bikila Evo's (size 43) so that I could wear them with socks in the winter months. I ordered a 42 in the Spyridon MR's because I wanted them to fit snugly without socks. I will be participating in the Rugged Maniac Mud Run, the Wipeout Run, and the Spartan Sprint. I wanted a shoe that would provide great traction and could get wet and muddy and not slip off my feet. When I first put them on, they were very tight. I did not like how snug they were at all. My foot filled the entire shoe. I walked around my house in them and was unhappy. I contemplated sending them back and ordering the 43. I took them off and repackaged them. I do not want to wear socks on the mud runs so I took them out of the box and tried them on again. This time, I wore them outside and walked to the pool in them. They seemed to be loosening as I walked. They still felt like a glove, but it wasn't uncomfortable at all. I have two weeks until my first mud run and I will be wearing these every chance I get so that I can break them in. That part seems to be mandatory. I am a 5'10 270 lbs, 31 year old female These shoes aren't very pretty and I can't wear women's vibrams. The black ones cost twice the amount of the grey and orange ones. However, mud is brown so I guess the color of the shoe doesn't really matter. I am excited that I have a shoe that I can wear that can tolerate any surface I run on.	2015-08-04

I mainly use these boots for farm chores and these seem to be constructed pretty tough and I like the good amout of arch support they provide. They may be a little heavy for some but are far lighter than many other boots on the market given they have a neoprene upper. I wasn't how sure how I would like the upper and was concerned that it may be to tight for my large calf. It does fit a little snug but is still comfortable and that snug fit keeps the hay, and other things, out of your boots which I love and it flexes more than traditional rubber which makes walking for longer periods the mud and muck more comfortable. Not sure how far they will hold up in the long run, I've had them 4 months, but so far they have lived longer than some of the cheaper brands.	2015-08-04

I have always thought I was a size 6.5 but I recently had my feet measured in a store and that said I was a 6.  I ordered both 6 and 6.5 of this shoe and the 6 was perfect.  I plan to wear them to a wedding and I think they will be comfortable enough for the whole evening.  They have a mid-height heel but don't look granny-ish.  The sole has a non-slip suede-like patch which is a good feature.  I don't think arch support is really expected in an evening shoe.  I can't usually keep sling-backs on but I don't think I will have a problem with these.  The color is sort of &#34;old gold&#34; or gold going towards bronze.  It works with my outfit.  Very good value too.	2015-08-04

My daughter was so excited to get her New Fast Running Shoes. As I have read on other reviews, they do seem to run a bit smaller, so I ordered a 9 even though her wears an 8 in all her sandles this summer, but she does not have any other tennis shoes so I don't have much to compare it to. She does have wider feet than my older child, so she really only wears these shoes for soccer practice or the park, but takes them off as soon as possible as they are a bit narrower than some of the other styles we have. You can adjust that a bit via the velcro, but it is limited to get it attached enough to keep it on.	2015-08-04

I just bought several pair of really nice shoes on clearance at a local shoe store, and decided that it was time for a shoe horn. All I knew about shoe horns was that my grandfather had one. It was metal. It was a nice quality feeling metal. It felt like a tool, not a toy. This Shacke metal shoe horn is a nice heavy gauge metal that feels like a tool... not a toy. It allows me to ease my foot into my shoe without breaking down the back of my new shoes. When I wear casual shoes, I can just slip them right on. When I wear tennis shoes, I feel like I am cheating because I don't have to untie my shoes and I know that I'm not breaking the backs down like I used to. Grandpa taught me about using the right tool for the job and buying quality tools. This tool is a quality piece that I could see my grandfather using. If you need a shoe horn, this is the one you need. It's not a fancy gadget with a bottle opener built into one end and a letter opener on the other... It does one thing, and it does it exactly the way it is supposed to.	2015-08-04

I went up a half-size because it was prime-eligible and about $60 cheaper, and i wanted to be able to put inserts in if needed. I wore these the first day with no added insoles and they were a dream. They are definitely a little too long (which i expected) but the width was a bit on the narrow side so they hugged my feet enough that they were still very comfy.

I've been working out and running in them for 4 or 5 years now.<br /><br />I'll assume if you're reading this review, you already know that it takes some time to change over to this shoe and you're just looking for a replacement.  If not, I suggest reading Vibram's info on changing over.<br /><br />I typically buy a 38 or 39 in Vibram and the 38 in this shoe fit perfectly.  I hadn't actually realized that it had real laces tie.  I should have read the description more carefully as I thought that this was more of an elastic pull, but in the end it's fine.  Just a bit more time to get on and off than I really wanted.  But for the price and style, I can live with that.  I also think the bottom of this shoe will last a bit longer than some of the other Vibram styles I've bought.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with these and they're pretty much exactly what I was looking for.	2015-08-04

I have always had heel pain and 4 docs + xrays and no one could find the problem.  But to my complete shock, wearing these all day decreased my foot pain almost in half!  I think it has to be the way the shoe cups the heel.  So I decided to buy this pair too...  It is so much prettier than the picture shows.  The colors are very bright, the stitching looks to be quite secure and they fit true to size.  It is even comfortable in the instep area; which is definitely something new to me!

Goes great with a retro-50s look. The only knocks I have so far and take them for what it's worth... The heel area is rather heavy. Combined with the &#34;slick&#34; jelly material, they tend to slip off my heel. Enter the ankle strap... the image shows the strap very narrow and fragile looking - it's that way in reality. I do worry about how sturdy the strap will prove to be since the jelly shoe material and my foot inside create a sort of suction and make a sucking sound when I walk. If it's humid I could have real trouble. That suction puts extra tension on the cute little ankle strap.<br />But they are TOO CUTE! If you have the right kind of outfit these are the shoes! I was looking for something to go with that &#34;Marilyn Monroe&#34; type of halter summer dress and these are perfect! Just a perfect amount of whimsy to an otherwise seductive outfit. I really like the strip on back too - that reminds me of seamed stockings from the 50's adding to the intrigue of this ensemble.	2015-08-04

Although the arch support is adequate, for sandals that is, the arch support does not align well with the arch of my foot. I would have exchanged these for a size 10, I believe that my heels would probably overhang the back somewhat. Nothing is perfect and overall, I am pleased.	2015-08-04

He is a farmer and works outside in the heat and on rocks, etc all day.  He normally wears a Rocky boot during the winter, but needed something cooler for the summer.  He is HARD on shoes, and these last him throughout the entire warm season (here in Texas) - which is about 9 months out of the year. A great shoe!	2015-08-04

I like the style.  The top thatched part looks a little cheap, but the price for the shoes was quite reasonable so it's not too much of a deterrent.  I have narrow heels, and this shoe does seem to move around a lot in back, but it adjusts just enough that I think I'll be able to wear them ok.<br /><br />I say THINK, because I only received the left shoe.  And then I received the left shoe of a completely different style of Ibiza (55, I think).  That one is also quite nice, quite comfortable, and very stylish.  However, having 2 left shoes of different styles isn't all that much fun and is pretty annoying, in fact.  And clearly I can't wear either pair around to note how comfortable they are after some wear.  So I have to return, but I'll be keeping this style (63), as I think they look a little more chic than the 55 (which I never ordered in the first place).<br /><br />I'm only knocking 1 star off for sending me only 1/2 of the pair of shoes I ordered, because the shoe itself seems like it will be fine.	2015-08-04

I have purchased several of the DMX shoes over the years, and they are generally very good.  These are the most recent purchased, and there is a noticeable reduction in quality in the shoes.

These are the most comfortable running shoes I've been able to wear without a decent break-in period. The shoes hug my feet without pain. The colors are so pretty, and I get compliments on them when I wear them out. I'm looking forward to working out in them, because I'm able to wear them while being active for lengths of time without pain on the lateral side of my foot, like my other pairs. I would recommend these shoes to anyone who doesn't have major pronation issues and needs a good neutral shoe, as I don't, and can't speak for those who do. I noticed just yesterday, that if anything, I was more comfortable in these shoes by the end of the day, so I think once they are truly broken in, they'll be perfect. I haven't noticed any flaws yet either. I worried when I saw another that they usually need a half size larger in Asics, but I find these fit perfectly at my regular size, with enough toe room that I'm not rubbing the end, even at the end of the day.	2015-08-04

I loved these shoes online, and I was fully prepared for them to be stiff and uncomfortable, as this style of shoe often is.

I wear an 8.5 and the fit is just right, and the color (I got green) is beautiful. Warning, though -- even though they are more comfortable than expected, they will still NEED to be broken in. Do not put them on for the first time and plan to wear them comfortably for a 10 hour day! I wore them down the street for an hour and I can feel the blisters starting. I plan to wear them with socks around the house until they loosen up a bit. Nothing I didn't expect with this style, though. great value, cute shoe.	2015-08-04

Wore them in the water during the swim portion of a sprint triathlon (having checked with the race director first to ensure they would be allowed), since I was concerned about the run from the water's edge to the transition area. I don't kick much in the water (saving my legs for the bike and run), which is a good thing, since they fill with water immediately. Of course, since the upper is mesh, they'll get sand in them as well as water, but I was mostly concerned with having a solid tread that I could wear in the water. The tread was PERFECT for the sprint to transition. And the locking drawstring at the back of the shoes kept them on in the water.	2015-08-04

UPDATE 8/13/15 I removed 2 extra stars from my original review for a very simple reason that other reviewers have mentioned, and that is the shoe sole started coming apart. And to make it even worse, during the game the loose sole piece rolled under my foot and made me fall while trying to stop my run. I also played in these exactly 7 times (3 sets games each) which really unacceptable for such a company and at this price tag.  UPDATE 9/7/15 I contacted asics USA about this issue, and they replied within a couple of days asking to return the send them the shoes and get a refurbished (exact similar model) pair with no guarantee on the color. But this obviously raises 2 issues: (1) I won't have an indoor pair for at least 30 days (that's their min turn around time according to the support email I got) and (2) I will run into this exact same issue right after I get my other pair... I really wish I could get a store receipt (even for 80% of this pair's price) or something like that to get a different model.  I'm really disappointed in asics, and I will probably just look for mizuno shoes (they seem much more durable - most of my team play in the tornado for over a year)	2015-08-04

I am very hesitant to purchase sunglasses over the internet without wearing them.  I am this way with shoes, clothing, etc.  However, I took a risk on this and am very happy I did.  I am very particular about sunglasses and the way they fit me and how they look.  These sunglasses not only fit great but look really great.  I am not one for expensive sunglasses these days because it seems whenever I decide to buy them, they either suffer an unfortunate accident or are lost/stolen.  I also enjoy something I can wear to the beach and in the water without having to worry about losing a ton of money if they fall or suffer any other fate.  If this style of aviator fits you and you want something that has an expensive look to it without spending too much, I would absolutely recommend these.	2015-08-04

I'm a half size (9 1/2) and ordered a 10. It doesn't slip off because of the draw string on the back. Maybe mine was just defective.	2015-08-04

I love the pattern and style (although the metal plate at the toe I could do without; a little much for me but I know it's the signature of the brand). They are great quality (as expected from Ted Baker). Unfortunately, I needed shoes quick for an event and bought 2 different pairs of shoes just in case one didn't fit - and these were the ones that had to be returned...they are too long for my feet. I'm usually either a 6 1/2 or 7 but mostly 6 1/2 in sandals so that's what I bought. Even the 6 1/2 were too long (there was about an inch of shoe showing beyond my toes), and my feet were just sliding around.  They are not particularly comfortable either - but I really wasn't expecting them to be! I'd bought some ball of foot pads just in case! These are definitely for looks, not practicality!	2015-08-04

I wore them out because they were so comfy.  I always received compliments wherever I wore them too.  I never thought I'd see another pair, and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw them on Amazon.  I forgot that they do run vey narrow, though, and had to return the first pair for a wide width; which I never take, except for Eastland shoes.  I'm 5'8&#34; and weigh 115, wouldn't expect to require wide in anything.  These shoes work great with jeans.  Thanks, Eastland and Amazon for carrying one of my all time favorite shoes.	2015-08-04

Apart from the smaller fit	I have used various Asics shoes for the last 12 years.  I have been using the ASICS GT-XXXX trail shoes for the last 4 years.  Last two pair were the GT-2000 2.  These fit slightly smaller and I read they were a bit small so I went to a local store to try them.  I use these for up to 50 mile trail runs and I love them.  Apart from the smaller fit, these are on par with the GT-2000 2.  I also use the GT-2000 road shoe for weekday short runs and track workouts and they are very similar to the trail.<br /><br />These shoes provide the support that I need.  I have slightly high arches and used to deal with plantar fasciitis but have not had issues with these shoes, so I stick with them year after year.  They are very comfortable and have good traction on the trails.	2015-08-04

I ordered the exact same pair, same size and color, and it was smaller than usual. I suggest trying them on in a store.<br /><br />the other thing is, get these originals with the gum rubber sole. they are TEN TIMES better than the cheaper version they call &#34;bushacre&#34; you might see at a discount price. trust me. they last longer and are much more comfortable. worth the extra cost.<br /><br />the soles are pretty flat. my feet need good arch support. i bought some ten dollar dr school's arch support cushions and BOOM--they feel perfect. I have to get half a size larger to make sure they fit with the arch supports.<br /><br />my final note is that the 4 lace holes aren't enough for me. i like to be able to lace a little higher so my foot doesn't slide around too much inside the shoe. you can go to a shoe repair cobbler place and they can do that--grommets and all--for not very much money.<br /><br />i know these are a lot of caveats for a shoe i rated 5 star but hear me out: after all these conditions were met, these have become my absolute FAVORITE shoes. i wear them almost every day. they match with 90% of my outfits. they look great, feel great, and like a good pair of jeans, they get better with age.<br /><br />as long as they keep making them in this style and color and I can find the size that fits right, i will probably keep buying them whenever i need to, forever.	2015-08-04

They have a perpetual issue of poor durability, with each pair lasting between 6 - 12 months of almost-daily use. This pair is no different, with the tread separating from the sole almost immediately. I've learned to re-glue them every few weeks.<br /><br />The Bare Access 4's have a significantly more aggressive (trail) tread than previous incarnations. I've noticed it feels much stickier on the road, which has allowed me to run faster and corner harder with confidence that previous versions didn't give me. The deeper tread has also allowed me to venture off the asphalt onto the trails. The stickier, deeper tread has the obvious trade off of reduced durability and tread life, but I prefer it. I'd rather get 6 hard months of running out of these than 12 tentative months.	2015-08-04

I've been working out and running in them for 4 or 5 years now.  Over time, the bottoms of any of these wear out from running, but in some ways I like that better than traditional shoes where it's not until I start having some knee pain that I realize that it's time to replace the shoes.<br /><br />If you're not used to these kind of shoes, I'd say it takes about 3 weeks to get totally acclimated.  You run differently - striking on the ball of your feet instead of your heel.  But if you make it thru the transition, they are incredibly comfortable.  That said, I only use them to run inside on a treadmill or maybe on pavement.  This particular style won't work on dirt roads with rocks, etc.<br /><br />I typically buy a 38 or 39 in Vibram and had a hard time finding the right size for the KSO Evo.  I ordered the 38 and it feels just a bit small, but these shoes will definitely stretch over time so I think it will be fine.  But if you're on the fence, I'd suggest going up a size.  Note that they are always tough to get on at first.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with these and they're pretty much exactly what I was looking for.	2015-08-04

I own 2 pairs of the Denver caimans and 1 pair of the Franklins, all are very comfortable and fit just right. When I opened the package everything was packaged nicely. As soon as I opened the box the sweet aroma of leather filled the air, the boots are beautiful and the workmanship is superb. The leather is soft and supple and the color is awesome. As I pulled on my new pimp as hell boots, it was like the boots hugged my feet like long lost friends finally reunited. The boots are great and feel like they are already broken in. These are going to be my new favorite boots when going out 2 steppin or for Sunday mornings when I sit on my porch and have a cup of coffee and read the paper. If you have a chance to buy a pair, Do it! You won't be disappointed. Cheers!	2015-08-04

However, when we received the two pairs, one pair had obviously been worn by another customer. I contacted Amazon, and they immediately offered a new pair (we wanted this option but then they were out of stock in his size) so Amazon gave us a 50% refund on that pair. Still wearable, but they HAD been worn before! The other pair were brand new, tags attached. My husband says the arch is very nice and helps his feet. He is on his feet all day long and does physical labor.  REVISION: My husband has worn these shoes LESS than a month, and they are starting to come apart where the sole meets the fabric part of the shoe. He has worn them every day at work, but a shoe should last longer than this :(	2015-08-04

The only (big) caveat I have with this shoe is that it slips off my heel. If I tighten it to the point where it doesn't slip, it's waaay too tight on the upper part of my foot. I've worn them on a few short hikes to break them in. I'm not sure I would take them on a long hike yet, because of the heel slip issue.

I also appreciate that even though these are pointed at the toe, they do not crease at the tip from walking- some cheaper shoes I've purchased that are the same style have done this, and it's really tacky. I'm quite satisfied with these, and they do run true to size! I'd advise that if you are a half size to size up to the next whole size.

I measured my foot, and used the crocs sizing chart.  It said I should be a 6.  I normally wear a 5.5 in dress shoes and the crocs website said order up to the next size.  I was confident a 6 would fit.  I HATE how my toes were at/over the edge when I walked/stood up. After doing more reading I saw that other reviewers posted pictures that showed they fit like this.  I tried a size 7, but they were all around too big and the straps were huge.  So disappointed!  (My order was through crocs webpage, so I also had to pay return shipping).	2015-08-04

I got them for a New Years Eve wedding and after reading some of the other reviews that mentioned that they had little cushion, also got a pair of Dr. Scholls inserts to go with them.  For the extra $10 or so, it made them very comfortable and easy to wear through the ceremony, photos, and lots of dancing...and I never took my shoes off until I got home!  Since then, I've worn them out a couple times and also wore them for a photo shoot which was about 5 hours of standing around, so I am very satisfied with this purchase!  Even though they are very sparkly and great for formal events, they're also perfect with a pair of jeans for a night out!	2015-08-04

I have used these insoles for several years now.  Any of the &#34;stiffener&#34; insoles are expensive, but the sorbothane appear to not only have a decent (albeit still expensive) price point but are reasonably well built also.  The top fabric  eventually will wear out under the heels (I use them in all my shoes, including my athletic shoes) and the heel cushion also will lose some of its usefulness over time. However, they remain a solid comfortable product for those of us who require a stiff midsole (those of us with flatter arches and some need of pronation support).  The graphite midsole does lose some of its adhesion after a while (a year in my case) and that is when I chose to replace them.  I also have washed them with good success. All in all a reasonable product that is built well.  I did not rate them as 5 stars simply because I do have to replace them and for the price wish that they would last as long as the shoes.	2015-08-04

I love the look of these tennis shoes so I'm disappointed that they didn't fit well.  I play singles during the summer USTA season so I need something light and stiff, but with enough support that I don't get hurt.  I was so excited when I opened the box and saw how nice these sneakers look.  But once I put them on, I realized that I needed to return them.  They are way too big around the ankle/heel area.  The shoes fit every where else, so it's not the case of getting a smaller size.  When I walked, my heel came right out of the shoe.  I would get killed on the court if I tried to play with them.  My other tennis sneakers, have an additional lace hole further up the ankle area so that you can tighten them.  These do not have that, they just end on the front so there was no way to tighten the shoe enough to keep my heel from slipping out.	2015-08-04

I was wearing work shoes but I wanted comfort and heard about the Skechers Go Walk brand. Walking in these shoes is like walking on clouds. They are very lightweight and flexible. The shoes work better on hard surfaces and not so well on carpet or padded surfaces. I do wish they made an all leather upper and not mixed cloth. When these shoes get wet, they get very damp inside and become squishy until they dry.	2015-08-04

The support was also great while working out. I always wear a 9 in Reebok shoes - in fact, Reebok is the only brand I've purchased for exercise over the past 3 years. I wore these twice in the gym and both times they rubbed a massive blister on the back of my heal and achilles area. Changing sock height to cover that area of my foot did not help. It was evident the shoes didn't need to be &#34;broken in&#34; so I decided to return them. I don't know if it's because they run small or if it's just a design error with the shoe back being too high and tight. Wish they had worked out since they look so cool!	2015-08-04

There is no doubt this lesser finish played a part in the lower price. Pros: very light and comfortable. Vision great. Cons: atypical finish that isn't very attractive. Plastic lenses (polycarbonate) may feel cheap. Bottom line: good back-up pair, but not at this price. If you're used to $10 sunglasses, this is a definite upgrade. If you've owned RB or other high quality polarized glasses, you probably won't like these.	2015-08-04

The flip flops are comfortable, and they fit well. The sole has good grip too. But I do not know what kind of material Crocs used to fabricate the flip flops, because they make may feet sweat like crazy. Imagine that a flip flop, where your feet are out in the open air, makes one feet sweat. I have worn military boots, and they have not made my feet sweat. I have worn all kinds off shoes and sandals, and they do not make my feet sweat. I have kept the flip flops for a long time, and still to try wear them today, and they still make my feet sweat. I washed them, and still make my feet sweat. So Crocs have used a strange material composition to make the flip flops I bought. This is the first time I have lost my money when buying at Amazon.	2015-08-04

No breaking-in period, no rubbing blisters, no sticky leather when your feet get hot. These do run a little wide, but I tend to like a slightly roomy sandal, especially around my toes. They do not provide any arch support, if that's important to you, but the footbed is soft and flexible. The material of the footbed feels a little cheap and I wonder how long it'll last, but the level of comfort for the price ($30) feels like a good value, even if I have to buy another pair next year.<br /><br />I generally wear a 7 or 7 1/2 and size 7 Minnetonkas fit me well.	2015-08-04

Don't make my mistake! I don't know if Asics changed manufacturers or design or materials or what the difference is, but these shoes are of considerably lower quality than previous Asics Gel Ventures I've purchased. Stepping on a rock while wearing them is like stepping on a rock barefoot -- I feel everything through the sole, especially on the ball of my foot, and it's very painful, regardless of whether I'm running or walking. In addition, the left shoe has developed an odd diagonal crease from the bottom of the laces toward the toe of the shoe, as though I'm wearing a really cheap imitation-leather shoe or one that doesn't fit well (they're the same size I always wear, and they fit fine). That problem is cosmetic, and while it's irritating, it wouldn't keep me from buying the shoes again. However, the problem with the soles isn't so easily overlooked. I haven't decided yet if I'll buy another pair of Asics, but I need to decide soon. I'm not going to be able to wear these for long.	2015-08-04

I haven't changed the way I run or anything,  but typically I get a good 6+months out of my shoes ( I retire them still with tread life left.) However, its been 4 1/2 months, and the tread it completely worn out (flesh with the bottom of the shoe). Very disappointed.	2015-08-04

I have one issue with them only on the 10's, where the gortex splits at the crease of the toes after 2 to 3 months. .  But considering im doing 80 miles a week on tough terrain I'm pushing then to the extreme.	2015-08-04

I am a runner so this review might not pertain if you're purchasing for being on your feet all day in these. I have rather narrow feet and they are way too wide for me. I purchased these to replace my trusty ASICS shoes that were a tad too short for me and no longer seem to have footbed support.  I put them on and was in instant heaven. Yes - they are cushy and comfortable. But... (after about 20 miles)...<br />As a runner, i need a shoe that rolls with my feet (ASICS have been awesome). These being too wide for my foot make me feel like I'm not making 100% contact with the ground as I have a lot of movement between the ground and my foot. I think another part of it is the cushy-ness - it's too much for running. At first I really appreciated because I first used on concrete path and they felt heavenly! Normally I run trails and there have been times I was afraid I would twist an ankle because the shoes move independent of my feet. I tightened, cinched - that made my toes go numb but didn't make the shoe fit better. As I said I have rather narrow feet - but not extremely narrow.<br />I tried using them for a &#34;run errands&#34; shoe and they are okay. I didn't find them so extremely comfortable I would want to wear them all day. I actually had to put on other shoes mid-day my legs were hurting.<br />I know I conflict with many other reviews - but for those who tend to have shoe fit issues like I do, I hope this is helpful.<br />Last time I ran, I returned to those old ASICS I thought had worn out and appreciated my old trusty shoes.	2015-08-04

The bottom portion was plenty wide enough to accommodate my feet without flowing over.  I ordered my exact size (8 1/2).  If I put my foot flush up against the back panel there is bit of room over my toes.  The ankle strap was a bit looser than I would have liked. It would be nice if they could have made the ankle strap adjustable but for $20 I would say I am pleased with what I got for the price.  I got compliments on them all day at work.	2015-08-04

This is my second pair of these shoes.  I had custom inserts made, and it is generally recommended that you buy a shoe one size larger. BUT, I didn't want to do that, because a larger size feels awkward, and feels like I could be tripping over my feet.  These shoes are my true normal size.  They have a wider toe box, and it accommodates my foot.  Some shoes also don't have a low enough cutout for my ankle bone, but these shoes don't interfere with the ankle bone. The shoes provide excellent stability as well. I walk several miles in them everyday.  I was initially fitted in a specialty athletic store for runners, but was delighted to find the exact shoe at a much better price on Amazon.	2015-08-04

They deteriorated in the area between the bottom of the laces and the toe in less than 10 months. Now you can see what color socks I am wearing if you are staring at my shoes.

I can shove an extra full set of clothes or two in the bag with a small bag of toiletries and essentials and it works great for 1-2 nights. Looks a lot better than a duffle bag, and has two compartments that's separated by the middle zip pouch. Easy to keep toiletries separate from clothes, or to put worn clothes on one side and clean clothes on the other. My MacBook Air even fits in the middle compartment if I needed to take it with me. Definitely too small for anything more than 2 days, though. Looks great, and you could even carry it around as a shoulder bag, though I think it's a bit big for daily use to have to carry around as a purse.	2015-08-04

I'd say my legs are about average in width for my height and weight category.  I bought the boots in size 6.5, black.<br /><br />I wear inserts with these boots, as the arch support is terrible, though the inserts make the boots a bit tight around the foot.  Without the inserts, I can't wear these for even an hour.<br /><br />The shaft of the boots hits a couple of inches below my knee, even though the description claims that the shaft is 16 inches long.  The shaft is also pretty narrow, and my calves just barely fit.<br /><br />However, the boots look great, better than the picture.	2015-08-04

I'm excited to test out the waterproof leather.<br /><br /> I went a 1/2 size up and the fit is perfect! They are narrow, so if you have wider feet, they might be snug.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase!	2015-08-04

I normally order a larger size for boots (8 1/2 boots for my size 7 feet) so I can wear thicker socks in the winter. These are a bit tight with thick socks on, but I'm hoping the soft leather will stretch out a bit after a couple weeks. These will be perfect for the fall! I like to wear them half-zipped and tie the laces around the zipper like other reviewers suggested. It not only makes the clacking zipper noise go away, but also makes the boots more comfortable to wear (not as tight around the calves).	2015-08-04

Great flexibility in the sole, nice design and materials. Unfortunately, the shoes are too tight for my little guy's feet. Plenty of room in the toe, but the rest of the shoe was too tight. Could barely fit them on him, the strap cut into his ample ankles, and when I got them off him, his feet were criss-crossed with indentations from the straps. He really liked them, though, and wanted to wear them, even though he proclaimed them 'Too small'. (He is a 21 month old that wears a 7 shoe and a 3T in clothes, for anyone else with bigger kids.) Really wanted them to fit!	2015-08-04

I bought them because my beloved Mizuno Wave Alchemy were discontinued. When standing and walking, the fit of the Paradox feels similar to the Alchemy, but when I running I noticed that the Paradox doesn't provide nearly as much cushion as the Alchemy did. It just feels harder! This is pretty disappointing as the Paradox is supposed to be an improvement from the Alchemy. It isn't. What's frustrating is that it's hard to tell if a shoe will work for you unless you truly use them, and in doing so you no longer have the option to return or exhange since they're now used.<br /><br />If you're using these as walking shoes, they will be fine but if you need strong cushion support for running, I recommend looking at other shoes.	2015-08-04

I have very bad feet with Osteoarthritis of both and they are always swollen. Because they are stretchy I felt I could not go wrong. It was instant relief for my poor arches and the massaging buds on the sole did help, having the straps stretch didn't hurt either. I was also concerned with the width, I'm 9 wide, no trouble with them not fitting. I have told my friends about these shoes and would recommend them to anyone reading this review to give them a try unless you need soft soles, these are firm. I'm thinking of buying another pair.	2015-08-04

These aren't somewhat small in length but they would be better if Isotoner made them in a C/Dwidth like my old Acorns were. I just received these and will keep them. Acorn doesn't make my old style thong slippers anymore so these will have to do. I have diabetic neuropathy and high BP so I want comfort and a slipper that i can easily slide into after I've been out running earns, etc and my feet are swollen and painful. 4 stars are mostly for the price(cheaper than Acorn) and style. I'm going to wear these for a few weeks to evaluate comfort. If they were a C/D width I would have give them 4 stars today.	2015-08-04

My ankle didn't heal correctly after sustaining a bimalleolar fracture in 2007. I kept fighting the fine fight of wearing expensive flats all day then wearing my ankle brace in the evening, or after a full day of shopping. I tested this shoe while shopping at an outdoor mall with the summer temperature of 95 degrees. I was a bit skeptical if my ankle would hold up all day as the shoe's small hardware and heavy velcro stitching hit my scars on both sides of my ankle. I'm thrilled that I finally found sensible shoes that deliver ankle and arch support!!! I love the velcro straps because this eliminates a buckle which hit my lateral ankle bone. The sole is cushiony and soft to the touch. I normally buy wide shoes to accommodate for swelling but with the perfect fit out of the box, my feet didn't swell up after walking in the hot summer sun. Another poster mentioned the awful smell which was the first thing I checked for. :) Yes, there is a slight material odor, but it's safe to say it's gone after a full day of walking...LOL! The stock photo posted is slightly deceiving as it appears the material is a dark green. The shoe is actually a tad lighter, but still beautiful.	2015-08-04

The Running Zone was the only store in my vicinity that had just 2 choices and only got them into the store a few months ago. But that's a good sign, I think. They were out of the turquois yellow one because it's an older style. The fall pair was unattractive. A grey pink combination. The laces were oldfashioned, the tongue, I think you call that part, was cushioned, but not on the older style. I really didn't care for this very thin leather tongue. So hopefully, Hoka, got this right now for future models.  They run narrow. Normally, I am a 9 1/2, needed a 10, as I do in my Asics nimbus. The left shoe didn't fit right. The heel inside cut was too low for me. The asics come up higher and fit better. I didn't buy, obviously. I am still very interested in Hoka shoes but I am uncertain at this time. Also, your heels are kind of lower positioned than the rest of the foot and I could tell immediately.  Don't know if this is good or bad.<br />thank you. Just wanted to share.	2015-08-04

While these are just (barely) wide enough, they are not long enough from heel to &#34;annoying toe thong&#34;. That toe thong just pulls backwards into the &#34;toe crotch&#34; and is irritating at best. I want sandals I can forget about.<br />Here's the frustrating part: While Amazon provides free shipping and free returns in size 8 (I am a Prime Member) the size 9 is $5.00 more, will cost $13.98 to ship, and no free returns. What gives?? I will be returning these, but will not be trying the 9, it's just not worth the cost or the risk that they won't work either.<br />And I really WANT to try the 9, because here's what I do like about them: The footbed is very comfortable. The toe thong is smooth and seems like it would be very comfortable if it wasn't so tight. They are almost flat (very little drop) which is what I am looking for, and the fairly thin soles are quite flexible (most flat sandals have a stiff sole that doesn't allow my foot to articulate properly). There is not much in the way of arch support, but I don't need that. Finally, I think they are really cute, and surprisingly sexy. Sigh. The search for the perfect flat sandal continues...	2015-08-04

I've worn these shoes two summers in a row -- they were GREAT. This year I bought a new pair since my first pair were done... I bought this pair and this is what I am reviewing. Something is different. It's sort of weird, but the first time then took them off later when I got home, the tops of my feet were red and swollen. I chalked it up to just &#34;breaking them in.&#34; The next time I wore them, same experience. Again I sort of ignored it. Long story short, over the course of weeks, it has come down to the fact thatI cannot wear them without having this itchy, red, blistered skin on the tops of my feet!! it's simply bizarre. it seems to be an allergic reaction. What has changed? My guess is inside lining of leather straps has been replaced with a cheaper lining. This pair were about $40 cheaper that the orignal ones I bought a few years ago. Perhaps they are made a new factory in China or they company is using a cheaper lining to save on labor and quality....? All in all, I am really disappointed. Clarks, what is the deal?? The quality has simply changed and the shoe is not the same. Has anyone else had this experience?? It's bizarre. I am dealing with major skin problems from these shoes. I would attach a photo but it is gross. The itching wakes me up at night. I've stopped wearing the shoes for days, the skin healed, I went to wear them again and it's back. The skin on the tops of my feet is destroyed. Giving these shoes a big THUMBS DOWN!! My view of the brand is also depreciated. Cheap materials = not cool, Clarks!	2015-08-04

These shoes are very comfortable.  I would like the looks of them better if they had a buckle instead of the Velcro. However it does make them very adjustable. I have hammer toes and they fit comfortably over them. They also have good arch support. I still need a little more support if I am going to be on my feet for most of the day. I haven't found a sandal that will give me the support I need for that. I like the look of the material and so far has been no problem keeping them clean.

I needed a light-weight shoe for summer wear and knew my size for this brand. The arch and heel did not feel comfortable when I tried it the first two days.

Now, my arch is supported and my heel does not hurt. I am more hopeful my feet will be happier for the summer.	2015-08-04
US	41877830	R3UZUSMTHJI6F4	B00NHP5KCI	961272440	Five Ten Men's Hiangle Climbing Shoe	Shoes	5	4	6	N	N	Great entry level aggressive all around shoe.	Have been wearing these for about 4 months now. At first I wasn't sold, but that could have been because I had gotten use to wearing the 5.10 Team VXi for so long, which is the softest stickiest shoe I've ever worn. You feel everything with those for better or worse (but usually for better.) If you've ever climbed in the VXi before then you know that the one thing they don't do at all is edge hence why I started looking for another shoe to add to my closet.  I ultimately settled on the hiangle because I wanted something that would be equally aggressive but that would deliver in the few areas that the Team VXi can't. The shoes were extremely stiff and uncomfortable when I first got them, but loosened up after a few sessions, and have quickly become my go to shoe for outdoors (the VXi's super soft rubber gets torn up fast by the prickly rock out by me) and also for clinging to tiny edges. The longer I have the hiangles the more they become my every day climbing shoes, and the more the Team VXi becomes a shoe for training footwork and special projects where they naturally excel.  This is a firm, aggressive shoe that is great for people transitioning into their first aggressive (and relatively speaking affordable) high end shoe, and also makes a great all around kicker. The leather stretches a bit, but this thing has so much rubber on it, that they still feel nice and snug. I'm a street shoe 13 (occasional 12) and pinch down into an 11.5 in these. It's not a fun fit, but it's comfortable enough and they come off and on more easily than most slippers. Thick rubber on the heel and over the toes is great for heel hooks and bat hangs (though I wish it came back just a little further on the middle toes)  Would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a mid price range firm mid-sole aggressive shoe.	2015-08-04

I'm happy with these MX623's - I wear size 10.5 4E and fit is excellent. I wear a separate orthotic so want a removable insole which this of course has.  The review question asked about arch support and I said &#34;no arch support.&#34;  Hey face it, get yourself a consistent orthotic. Don't rely on various shoes to give you arch support. Give it to yourself consistently!<br /><br />New Balance is known for changing styles all the time -they really angered my years ago when they were the only wide width game in town - there is now more competition. Hear that, New Balance!  Keep this style going consistently. Why do you go out of your way to change models all the time. Don't you realize this alienates customers. You have me currently.

They really do look better in person than online. On the other hand the comfort is not that great. After an 8 hour shift, I couldn't wait to take these off my feet. Maybe they need more time to get broken in? I don't know, but I really don't want to risk spending money on a shoe that hurts my feet. Also the side zipper is useless, You have to unzip it to actually comfortably put the boot on and off. They still look good though	2015-08-04

During my painful months of physical therapy I couldn't carry my heavy leather designer purse, and this lightweight beauty was the perfect solution. I find that it is just roomy enough for my essentials (wallet, cell phone, keys, lipstick), but not so large that I am tempted to fill it up with non-essentials and put stress on my shoulder. I gravitate towards the black because it goes with almost everything, but I also love the other color choices. My now rehabilitated shoulder no longer keeps me up at night aching a heavy purse. Light weight is the way to go!	2015-08-04

I measured the thong that goes between your toes from the inside edge of the shoe to the thong and the right shoe thong measures 1/8&#34; to the right  from the thong on the left shoe, making the right shoe unbearable to wear. It's hard to believe that 1/8th of an inch would make that much difference. I kept thinking that I could eventually make it comfortable, but was never able to, which made it too late to return, so now I'm stuck with a pair of unwearable shoes. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone.	2015-08-04

So the elastic band that holds the tongue in and works as a compression point on your foot has the tendency to dig into the foot. I ordered mine 1/2 larger, and still noticed this issue. I will be putting gel inserts in To replace the current ones. I have put 54 holes in with these shoes plus plenty of range time in the week and a half I have had them.<br />Spikeless is definitely a new concept to me, but the fact I don't have to change to go into the clubhouse makes them a good choice<br /><br />The shoes themselves even with the elastic issue are still comfortable. Walking 18 (carrying not using a push cart) is easily done. Only slight discomfort when walking down anything steeper than say 12-14% grade. Up hill, flat, and low incline are fine. I'm assuming the downhills will be easier once I change inserts.<br /><br />They did come with another pair of inserts, so I may try those before investing in Gels	2015-08-04

They had all the elements I was looking for in a pair of hikers, all leather uppers, classic design, vibram soles, etc. I ordered a size 13 thinking they would fit since I sometimes wear 12 and a half in other brands. Nope. They were too small, but just by a hair, my big toe barely making contact with the end of boot when I walked (not something you want when hiking down hill). So I exchanged them for the next size up, which was 14 since they don't make half sizes beyond size 12. Unfortunately, the 14's were too big (sigh).	2015-08-04

I have nearly the same shoe made by Skechers, but they are not nearly as comfortable as these, nor do they seem to be as well-manufactured as Sanuk's. I wear these shoes everywhere when I am not working. They are very versatile. The straps on mine were tight (almost too tight!) and I have had no problem with the back strap falling down as other reviewers have complained. But they are a soft material with give, so if I step onto uneven ground that tilts my shoe to the side, my foot slides off the sole, and I can definitely see how someone might twist an ankle this way! But the straps do add to the comfort of the shoe, so I prefer them to something more rigid.  As others have noted, the thong starts pretty far back in the bed. For those of us with shorter toes, that leaves more bed above the toes than would be ideal, but it doesn't look strange. It also did not affect sizing for me.	2015-08-04

I envision this being a bit of a nuisance.<br /><br />Edited:  After tinkering with them a bit it could have been that the lenses were not fully snapped in properly from the factory.

NOTE: Strong rubber smell....Like the cushiony sole with the comfort bumps and arch support. However, the right shoe feels like it has been tried on many times and stretched (so that it fits me comfortably), whereas the left is extremely tight. The V band crushes the top of my left foot so that I can't even get my toes all the way into the end of the shoe like I can on the right shoe. I did check the bottoms to ensure they are the same size--they are (M 5/W 7). Probably should have ordered an 8 as these look extremely short, making my feet look short and swollen. I'm 5' tall with average feet, so these SHOULD fit fine, but just way too tight on the left shoe, though the toe post length seems fine. Will try to wear these an hour a day with folded tissue under the V at toe post to see if I can stretch the left strap a bit. Otherwise, these will go to my skinny kid.	2015-08-04

If you are buying these and have a high instep, go a size up. I had to return this style as well as the Aerosole's women's coral reef style because my regular size 10 wouldn't fit, and I have bought several shoes from Aerosole's before. I found one of their stores close by me on a recent trip to Miami and I was able to go in and try on other pairs and I got two different styles fitting me in 9 1/2 and 10 respectively so it was definitely the style and not a size increase on my part.<br />The shoes are really well made and beautiful though I was really sad to have to return them.	2015-08-04

They also have a fantastic rubber sole that does a death grip to any wet oily or bloody surface (depending on what you do). Here's the trouble, my husband is a true size 10. He wears Keens exactly like this pair except it has laces and the fit great! They're called the PTC slip on ll. But these are just huge all around. My husband runs all over the OR and these shoes wouldn't stay on his feet if he had taken them in to wear. So I called keen to try and figure this out. My husband has a normal foot, not narrow, not wide, just average. Turns out, these shoes do that. Some people don't mind that constant flip flop. So they are a design that didn't work for us. However, not everyone has that experience and so I encourage you to try them. They may fit just fine for you. We had no trouble returning them the very next day and received a full refund that day as well. No hard done. I love Amazon Prime!	2015-08-04

I switched to North Face shoes, and they held up better but the narrow size hurt my feet after a long day.  For the past 2 years, I have only worn Merrell's wide shoe.  It is extremely comfortable, and keeps my feet dry (even in wet grass).  That said, it does take about a day for a wet pair of shoes to dry under regular conditions (so I have 2 pair).  I recommend these shoes for everyday walking, and offroad walking.  For jogging and treadmill use, stay away from these as they do not have the proper support.  I only have one negative comment and that is that I can not just push my foot into a laced up show.  I must insert my foot while placing my finder in the heal loop.  If I don't do this, then the heel support will break free from the shoe and rub my heal raw.  This is painful, and results in an early failure of the shoe.	2015-08-04

The stitching and seams are strong.  The fabric is strong and is very smooth so that the bag does not make your clothes bunch up under it.  The outside zippers work easily and have good sized zipper pulls so you don't have to search for them but can quickly feel them and pull the zippers open. The strap is completely adjustable and once at the proper length, stays at that length and doesn't slip.  The strap is also narrow, smooth and soft enough not to cause &#34;sawing&#34; on my neck and shoulder.  When I filled the bag with my wallet, phone, keys, notepad, pens, kleenex tissues, chapstick, compact, receipts, and a couple of miscellaneous small items, it still was not bulky, but rather slim and rested flat against my body.  The bag does not hold a water bottle, you will have to carry that yourself.  The color goes with just about anything and does not readily show dirt or soiling.  I love this little bag and I believe it will last for many years.	2015-08-04

I typically wear a 8.5 shoe and ordered a 9... it fits perfectly. When I got them wet they dried pretty quickly. There is canvas like material between the toes which takes a bit longer to dry but the sandal itself doesn't retain much water and dries rather quick. Also, when wet they are not &#34;slippery&#34; like most flip flops.  They remain grippy on your feet. I had one other pair before buying these...plan to buy more.	2015-08-04

I was even able to cancel the order for the compression socks because when I started walking in these, I had no more pain in my shins whatsoever.

They provide a slightly stylish look, while also being a convenient, comfortable shoe. I will buy these for life. Also, Sperry's come in different shapes and forms to accommodate your style needs or your foot needs. I definitely, and heartily, recommend these shoes.

She had the perfect face shape and the lenses made her face light up.  They are durable and a good quality.  The quality of the shades out weight the price and that is an added bonus.  I used to only buy one particular high end polarized shade for myself but now I see that Mambo shades are a great alternative.<br /><br />*  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-04

It will do everything better than your starter shoe, but with the added benefit of not obliterating your virgin climbing feet like a viciously down-turned shoe.  The first thing I did after my starter shoes kicked the bucket was upgrade to a pair La Sportiva Muira VS's, and while not a horrendous mistake, I later purchased a pair of Mocs as 'casual slipper' for sport climbing and general warmups.  It became clear at that point I had skipped a crucial step in my development as a climber.<br /><br />Some notes:<br /><br />-If you're careful about foot placement, these will put in work.  My current pair has been going strong for 18 months.  The edge is, of course, gone, but what you get during the later phase of the Mocc's life cycle is improved sensitivity and enhanced smearing.  This is important for beginner to intermediate climbers.  What I discovered is that the Mocc, being a more sensitive shoe, trained my foot placement and ultimately made my feet stronger on more difficult footholds.  A much stiffer shoe (indeed, certain aggressive shoes) will inhibit sensitivity, and, in many cases, encourage bad footwork.<br /><br />-As far as form-factor is concerned, you couldn't find a less fussy shoe. There aren't any gimmicks here. The C4 rubber is sticky and pliable, and is just thick enough to give you a good balance of support and sensitivity during the break-in period.<br /><br />-Fit is crucial.  If this is your next shoe after ditching your starters, don't be afraid to size down to something that is effectively uncomfortable.  These will stretch, and stretch significantly.  I wear between a 9 1/2 and a 9 in street shoes, and a 7 1/2 was a good (initially) uncomfortable fit.  After three or four climbing sessions, they were satisfactorily broken in, and remain exceedingly comfortable.  My feet are of average width, and I find that the toe box is literally the perfect volume.Likewise, my heel fits nicely in the heel-cup, and I can't say that my heel has ever been pulled out of the shoe even during the most demanding moves.<br /><br />-One thing to keep in mind is that, unlike many other 5.10 shoes (and most contemporary shoes, for that matter), the sole does not wrap up over the heel cup.  There's good rubber coverage on the heel, for sure, but it's not going to be terribly protective for your heel.  While this offers great sensitivity, it can also mean that throwing heels on sharp or protruding holds may be painful.  I've also noticed that, after months and months of using them, the adhesive that keeps the sole connected to the heel rubber has weakened, resulting in a *small* amount of separation.<br /><br />-The overall design of the Mocc has hardly changed since its introduction in 1990. It was originally designed for climbing long, demanding cracks, but they'll be great even for boulder problems in the V0-V6 range.  In fact, I've completed a few V8's in Mocc's when I needed to pull off a tough toe-hook that my Muira's couldn't manage.<br /><br />-They will dye your feet red.<br /><br />Bottom line, what you're getting is a no-frills classic that does everything above average.  There is no other *intermediate* shoe that offers the same performance and longevity for the value.<br /><br />TLDR:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+High versatility for an intermediate shoe. Will handle tough boulders, pumpy sport, and long, mutli-pitch grindfests.<br />+Comfortable once broken in.<br />+Best value at $110-$115<br />+Sticky C4 rubber that is fantastically sensitive.  Sensitivity means better feedback on foot placement.  Better foot placement means stronger climbing.<br /><br />Cons (but not *really* cons)<br /><br />-These shoes will stretch, so size down between 1 & 1/2 and 2 sizes from your street shoe!<br />-Heel may be too sensitive for new climbers<br />-No snazzy shoe technology offered in more contemporary shoes	2015-08-04

I love the boho look and how easy it is to clean (just throw it in the washer). It works well for every situation and holds a lot of stuff. I tend to carry at least one book with me, and whilst the bag gets heavy, it doesn't tear or rip.<br />My only complaint is that there are no dividing pockets. Gravity just kind of drags the heavy stuff to the bottom, and the top is a big layer of reciepts.  The front pocket is really nice, though. Perfect size for my Android.	2015-08-04

Although I have not used the bag yet, I received it the other day.  The studs and floral detail are blackish-pewter, exactly as shown in the photo.  What you can't see in the photo are three things that make this bag absolutely stellar.  First, the flower accent..  In the photo, it appears flat and flush with the fabric.  It's not!  It's slightly raised, VERY 3-dimensional, and substantial feeling!  It looks as if it could be used as a hair clip or even a jewelry-type pin/broach.  Second, the fabric itself.  It's a nice satin, and more importantly, it's finished properly.  I can't count how many times I've bought an inexpensive bag or shawl, only to find exposed seams or fraying bits sticking out.  The internal lining on this bag is tucked away properly.  And finally, the shoulder chain.  I have a few evening bags with shoulder chains, and when you want to just use the bag as a clutch, you stuff the chain into an inadequate little pocket inside the bag.  It always slips out of the little pocket and is rattling around inside the bag.  Other bags have crappy hook and eyes for linking the shoulder chain in place -- eventually the hook stretches out of shape and the bag is falling off the chain.  Not this one!  It actually uses a lobster claw clasp to secure the shoulder chain to a sewn in metal circle (can't remember the word for this), just as you would fasten a necklace.  The chain itself is thin, but decently made... I don't foresee it breaking while being used.  I bought this bag for a formal function, and it can easily hold my phone, lipstick, tin of mints and a tissue or two, with room to spare - yet it's sleek and streamlined.<br /><br />To summarize, excellent value, extremely attractive, well made.  I'm VERY glad that I purchased this bag.	2015-08-04

Excellent lenses but the rubber split on the nose bridge after 2 months of use, exposing the less comfortable metal underneath. I contacted JiMarti for a warranty inquiry only to be told they wouldn't fix them. So I asked to purchase a new nose piece and they said they do not sell replacement parts... I'd have to order completely new glasses! Honestly, for $34, they should have been willing to fix or send me a new nose piece after only 2 months. Totally unrealistic and terrible policy.<br />I continued wearing them through July 2015 by slipping the split rubber over the metal bridge before I put them on. I found the &#34;smoke &#34; frame glasses for $9.95 and decided to purchase them, again, because the lenses are really great. The nose piece looks a bit different, perhaps the problem for my original pair was a fluke?	2015-08-04

The Nike Flyknit shoe has a great fit around your foot but it does squeeze a little bit. The shoe itself has an awesome design, looks really cool and fits like a tight sock. My big complaint with this shoe is that the rubber lining separating the upper and the soul of the shoe is very flimsy. I was out for a run and dragged my toe which ended up scarring the rubber and rubbing off the black lining which exposed the front toe of the shoe. To my surprise the black rubber separation is just a light black film on a white base.  in only 1 week the shoes have started to degrade from walking and running. For the price of this shoe I am very unhappy with the cheapness of the rubber middle. I will not buy this shoe again.	2015-08-04

I ended up exchanging my 7M pair for a bigger size (half a size bigger), and I am still not happy with them. The arch support is not right, the sizing is definitely not right (7.5M feels now too lose, my toes wiggle way too much, the arch sits too far behind, almost under my heel... but the 7M was too small and my toes hit the front of the shoe when running). I might just be too used to my Nimbus, but I feel that this shoe &#34;goes flat&#34; after 4-5 miles of running. Not good for serious running. But quite cute to look at.	2015-08-04

Prefer an eye-catching design over a $90 metal name-brand label on a tired print? Then these may be for you.<br /><br />Over the past five years, I have owned three Shagwear wallets (their Canadian flag/maple leaf, the travel passport style, and a floral one). They are conversation starters wherever I go. People really want to know the story behind a stylized Canada goose or whether that's the Canadian flag on the back of my wallet. Yes, yes it is. Am I Canadian? Yes, I am. No, I don't know your cousin Bob in Toronto but let's talk about health care now.<br /><br />Shagwear would earn more points if they made their wallets to last more than a year. I'm not really that hard. I do not whip out wads of cash or pile in loonies and toonies by the dozen. Nor do I carry 72 loyalty cards because I don't think I can name 72 Canadian stores, let alone shop in that many. Unfortunately the seams on their wallets were sewn by gophers in Albertan mountain camps, pressed down by little paws, and no actual use of string or thread appears to meld the sides. The seams split easily when aggressively used -- say, by slipping your debit card into a slot once a day. It tears or wears away at the worst spots, right where cards line up or along the middle seam separating the cash pocket. Argh.<br /><br />Be gentle with zippers that tender hands have sewn in because they aren't made for a lot of wear and tear. Or rip and zip. They tend to pull away at one end and there's no way to really secure the zipper once it comes away.	2015-08-04

I found them to be uncomfortable, and I am not a wimp when it comes to high heels since I wear them regularly. They felt true to size as far as interior fit, and arrived in good condition in the correct brand. While attractive shoes, I needed something I could wear for extended periods and they were just too clunky and uncomfortable. They do appear much larger and more bulky in person than the picture.	2015-08-04

These new ones are not nearly as good	I bought these same flip flops (same name, model name) last year in a retail store.  It seems Fila has changed the design, because when they came in the mail (Same size I originally bought) they were completely different - the straps on the new shoe are shiny, the padding on the base was slightly different, and the soles are hard and plastic, not the rubber soles I had on the original shoe.  Very strange the differences.  I don't blame the seller from Amazon at all - delivery was onetime, and packaging was pristine, with labels on from Fila, etc.  Again, just seems the design has changed to a cheaper, less appealing version.  Disappointing, because the originals lasted me two solid summers f wearing them EVERY day even for very long walks, but they started to rip. They were the only flip flop I could wear comfortably.  These new ones are not nearly as good, but they were cheap and not worth the trouble of returning.	2015-08-04

Love them so much!	These just arrived today and I've been wearing them all day! I took others' advice and ordered a half size smaller than usual (normally a 7, ordered 6.5). They fit perfectly! They are really comfortable too! And boy do they SPARKLE! I got them in gold, and I thought they would be sort of a glossy metallic gold, but they are really glittery! The pictures do not do them justice. They are simply gorgeous and I LOVE them! I can't wait to wear them for a night out with my friends! The only inconvenient thing I'd say about these sandals is that the bottoms are very slippery. It doesn't bother me at all, but if it's something you would be bothered by, you may want to take that into consideration when deciding to buy them or not.

Good padding and cushioning, although for my foot I could use a higher arch--will have to put in inserts.  Toe box of shoe is quite roomy--your foot isn't cramped at all.  Like the chunkier look A LOT.  Very stylish.<br />The biggest drawback to this shoe is the odd sizing.  It fits like a man's shoe, with that wider heel that also makes unisex sizing not work for most women--notice they always default to a man's shoe &#34;last&#34; (which is what the form or &#34;pattern&#34; for a shoe is called), never a woman's.  Grrr.  My heel slips out in back, even when I tried it with footies and socks.  Because of this, I had to return my regular size 10B I ordered. Am hoping the 9.5 solves the heel issue but isn't too short in the length.	2015-08-04

Out of all the minimalist shoes I have worn (Vibram FiveFingers, Merrell BareAccess, NewBalance Minimus), these have, by far, the least ground feel.  For that loss of feel, they don't make it up in cushioning, though; it's a solid sole with very little compression-wise give.  I cannot wear them nearly as long, comfortably, as I can the Merrel or NewBalance.<br /><br />I wouldn't get them again, but there is nothing particularly wrong with them.	2015-08-04

This year he was delighted to see the eyes and teeth light up with each step and is always getting comments on how neat his crocs are.  We did have an issue with the heel strap breaking the 1st day of wear but the return/replacement feature through Amazon was fantastic and the replacement arrived very quickly.  My child is very hard on shoes and the painted robot shark is scuffed and chipped away in some areas, but I do not think it's an issue with craftsmanship rather daily wear from all day, outside play with an active child.  I highly recommend croc clogs to all parents of young children!	2015-08-04

Not as much arch support as the Kadee flat but they are so padded that I don't notice when wearing. I get compliments every single time I wear these and people are floored that they are crocs until I slip them off to show the amazing inside. They do get a little bit sweaty but you're wearing plastic shoes so that's to be expected. I'm typically a 7.5 so the 8 in these is a little loose but wearable as the pointy toe makes them fit a little snugger but that's what I expected. I also have the Kadee in an 8 and those are much larger, they feel about a half size smaller than the Kadee which works for me but might make them a bit snug for some. Worth trying, I recommend them all the time.	2015-08-04

I wear a 10.5, but 11 was what I ordered because I knew 9 would probably not fit.  They were super wide and my foot would work its way off the side of the sandal while walking.  The strap parts didn't secure the sandal to my foot very well, but maybe a smaller size would've worked?  Love the sandal's beauty. I'd say order a smaller size.	2015-08-04

I do have to buy a size up with these to get the arch in the right place which I don't like as I have a bit of room on either end of the shoe. I prefer my flip flops to fit the exact length of my foot.  It could just be my foot though. I give them a 5 star in spite of this because these things are so darn awesome!  I had given up on regular flip flops and gone to the Fit Flop style because regular ones made my 58 year old feet hurt if I wore them all day.  These things are truly the most comfortable flip flop I have ever owned.  They have a good arch and live up to their name with the cushioned sole.  And they are pretty too!  I had to make an unexpected 3 mile walk the other day and was wearing these.  I had no problems then or the next day.  I now own two different styles and will be buying any others they make available.  They are so worth Buying!	2015-08-04

These shoes were poorly made and I waited too long to return them, much to my displeasure.  The cloth lining of the insole came off (in the water) about the second time I wore them. Then in the midst of a water zumba class the whole insole came out over the top of the shoe.  Obviously the glue used for the adhesive was definitely not water resistant!!	2015-08-04

These shoes are gorgeous and I really wanted to make them work, but they are way too narrow!  I wore them out to a movie and halfway through the movie my feet were already throbbing. I always buy my boots a half size larger than my normal size so that I can put cushioned inserts in them. With these, I had to take the inserts out just to get in my foot properly.  They are adorable and I wish I could've made them work, but unless you have a narrow foot (not a regular width) you might want to skip these. Giving them 2 stars because they are beautiful, and because the laces and buckles are functional not just ornamental.	2015-08-04

Adidas footwear always runs large, but don't let that be a reason to stop you from trying their products. I find their products more reasonably priced than Nike, which is why I've made a permanent switch. This sneaker is super light. If you want to talk about cheaply crafted shoes, then yes all sneakers these days are produced in China. Nothing you can do about that. My only downside with this sneaker is the insoles. All you need to do is change the &#34;souls&#34; (hehe) of your sneakers. I've added $20 insoles and it's really made these pairs my new favorite. I haven't been able to replace my running sneakers in 2 years because I didn't have it in myself to replace my free runs every  year. I'm so glad I decided to go with these!	2015-08-04

This is a very stylish looking shoe, but I, and most other reviewers, have found it to fit small and tight. My wife bought my usual size 10, and even though I had sufficient room at the toes, it took me a few days to realize it was a narrow fit. Also, the sole and inner sole are very thin, and give little support. While these shoes are suitable for shopping and short jaunts, you will not find them comfortable for walking or long periods of wear.  But the most irritating feature of these shoes is that the inner sole sticks to your feet, and comes out when you remove your shoes. You have to push the inner sole right back into the toe area each time you wear them. Very time consuming and a major defect in a high end shoe. I've tried gluing the inner sole down with super glue and Gorilla glue, but the foam inner sole just tears off.  The only real solution is to toss the inner soles and buy a set of Dr. Scholls squishy inserts. All in all, a nice looking boat type shoe, but not recommended.  Update:  I followed my own advice and tore out the original foam inner soles, and replaced them with Dr. Scholls inserts. Even though this made the shoes more comfortable and wearable, I've left my rating at 3 stars. For such a high end brand, replacing the inner soles was a hassle, and had the effect of adding $14 to the original price.	2015-08-04

I have several pair of Merrell shoes/sandals and all have great arch support.  Not these.  There is some but not what I have come to expect from Merrell.  I also did not like the side view of these shoes with the gray -- I would have liked them better (had they fit), with a completely black footbed and sole. These shoes were also cut smaller than other Merrell sandals.  I typically wear a 1/2 size and size down but sizing down with these made them small -- the back of my foot was actually hanging over the back of the shoe.  Even had they fit, they would have been returned for the reasons I returned them as stated above.	2015-08-04

I am very difficult to please when it comes to shoes and I am very happy with these. I can only find fault with the open style which at times is a double edged sword. First of all thats why I bought them. As boat shoes for getting out in the shallows. But after walking sandbars near the ocean I found that snails and things get under your feet and you must remove the shoe to get them out. And even after rinsing them repeatedly I am still getting sand under my foot every time I wear them. I cant find where its hiding but Im sure it will run out eventually. Still give them 5 stars. I bought a pair of cheap knock offs last year and they ripped apart in a very short time. These seem like they will be durable as well as comfortable.	2015-08-04

Not only do the products look of very high quality but the cost if very affordable. This black purse looks like a leather purse but is in fact made of faux leather.<br /><br />It has 4 pieces in total. One is the main purse which has handles and it is quite big and very spacious. The next is a smaller bag which is more like a satchel and has 2 kinds of handles which are adjustable. Then you have the wallet and lastly a keyring or key holder.<br /><br />Over all the design is awesome and it looks great with any kind of outfit.<br /><br />Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.	2015-08-04

They have a really wide reach (the arms circle out like they are going to give your face a &#34;cousin hug&#34;). With that being said, I was able to bend the arms into a more natural looking and feeling fit using a blow dryer. I have a larger head but my face is not huge. 15 minutes with a blow dryer, all is well. With that all being said, these sunglasses are great. The few people that have tried them on really like the lenses and look (Mostly Ray-Ban fans). Hell, a friend even mentioned how much they liked the case. These things are solid and I'm glad I bought them at the price (just short of $50). It should also be noted that the frames are pretty true to color at the given angle in the picture but can look a bit more dark pink depending on lighting and whatnot.	2015-08-04

They are well padded and comfortable, and offer a wide toe box so that the toes can spread out comfortably. They are durable, as I have walked hundreds of miles in my first pair and they are still in good shape. I would just note that the design of the soles makes for a kind of rocking forward motion as you step, but most people should be able to adapt quickly.	2015-08-04

I ran a few half marathons last year in the 12's, and these feel just about the same, but maybe a bit smaller in the toe box, but it might just me the socks I had on the first run. Runs after all feel good. The blue color of this shoe is real nice looking. Much better color option than the 12's. This shoe is really about the support. They provide great support and have a great overall feel. Great cushioning for my mid-foot strike. When you need stability shoes, it should be about the feel, not the looks. This shoe hits homeruns on both ends. The best thing I can say about this shoe is this - when I run I do not think about my feet at all. That is how good the shoe feels.	2015-08-04

I got the taupe color and they are lighter in color than I expected (more ivory white than beige) but I like it! The top of the leather in the front of the shoe also does not come as high as I thought (not ankle high). I am size 7 and size 7 fit good, but I think 6.5 would have fit as well, maybe even better! Since the shoe is held by an elastic band in the back, I would assume that tighter is better for more support. But I have extremely thin ankles and a narrow foot, so if you are thin, then maybe half a size smaller would be best.	2015-08-04

I bought them for my daughter and she wore them only indoors. They lasted her about 6 months before the sole separated from the rest of the shoe.

I love this bag!  It is the perfect size and I can always find what I'm looking for in it (my keys! my cellphone!).  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a shoulder strap.

Unfortunately, the gores didn't provide any give across the instep of the shoe making them painful to walk in.  I do have a very high instep as well as a wide foot, so they probably would be comfortable if your foot is more in the &#34;normal&#34; range.  In the past, I have found Keens to be generously sized in this area, and all the styles I own have held up very well.  This one just wasn't made for me.	2015-08-04

They are lightweight to wear and love that it is lined in soft padded fabric plus the faux shearling which make them very comfy.  I have a slightly wide foot due to bunions and I also have a high arch but based on other reviews, I ordered my usual size 7M and they were perfect.  The toe box was roomy enough w/o being too large and length was perfect.  I could wear a thin sock or none at all.  One reviewer said they were not stylish but I disagree; I think they look great with jeans (but I tie them off on top of my arch, not all the way up).  I walk a lot every day and these will be great for tromping around in the woods and paths where I go.  Also love that these are a scotchguarded fabric that can be wiped clean.  I certainly did not want fancy expensive leather boots for walking around all day but it is hard to find anything like this boot so I am very happy.	2015-08-04

The colors just pop against my skin.  Agree with the other reviewer that the band in the back makes a sound as you walk.  However, I am used to making some kinda sound in my higher heeled shoes so it didn't bother me.  I ran around on the carpet a few times to make sure that my footing was secure and it was.

These are stylish, comfortable, durable, well-made sandals that fit true to size.  Sam Edelman offers the Gigi's in a variety of colors, so there is something for everyone in the Gigi line.  I have purchased many of these sandals (some from Amazon) and would have given the Gigi sandals a 5-star rating except for the Amazon PRICE point.  Several other department stores are currently offering all the Gigi sandals at SALE prices now that it is August -- discounted by at least $20.00 per pair. However, Amazon continues to charge FULL price -- Why? Amazon used to have a pricing feedback feature to report LOWER PRICES available at other retailers in order to price match and offer the lowest price. What happened to that feature?  Amazon is becoming less customer friendly and no longer appears to value their Prime Members loyalty. Note to Amazon -- Prime Members will and do shop elsewhere to get the best value for their hard-earned dollars.  Loyalty must be earned -- and Amazon needs to get back to their roots and do a better job or risk losing their &#34;bread and butter&#34; Prime Members.	2015-08-04

They also had gobs of glue all over them which I had to carefully pick off and in some spots it took the finish off the shoe.

I have wide feet and have had a difficult time with many of the popular trail shoes and these fit me great. I realize that for some this means they could be too wide in the toe box, so keep that in mind if you have normal to narrow feet. Not sure about durability yet, but I do have high hopes for this shoe.	2015-08-04

Otherwise they are very cute.  Order tour true size.  O couldnt decide who to listen to in the reviews so i got a half size larger as this style if too small is a nightmare.

So, when I saw that some people ordered a certain size and it was a size or two smaller than they expected, I decided to order a 10, because I am a size 9, and they fit perfectly. Like all shoes, you have to walk around and get used to them for a couple of days. The straps of the flip flops did give me slight discomfort on the top of my feet and in between my toes, but honestly, this was only for a day or so and I've experienced much worse pain with other flip flops. It's been a few days and they are really amazing flip flops, they're super comfortable, and they're so cute! Goes to show reading reviews before buying something is definitely a smart decision to make. I would definitely buy another pair and for a gift, as well!	2015-08-04

These worked great all day in and out of the water.  I normally wear an 11, and so I ordered an 11.  They fit me well, but I didn't wear socks with them. If I were to wear socks I think they would have been on the snug side.  They are a little snug around the ankle area when putting them on, but that is just because the tongue is attached, once my foot is in, they are very comfortable around the ankle, and they don't feel loose at all.  The elastic pull string helps snug them down too.  I like the enclosed toe, especially on the rocky shores of the river and climbing over rocks etc.  Really happy with these for comfort and being able to wear all day with no problems.	2015-08-04

I use these shoes with customer orthotics (for collapsed arches), so your experience may be different, but these are the best work shoes I've ever had. I work 8-10 hours per day as a diagnostic technician (Mercedes/Smart) and with these shoes (and the orthotics), my feet are always comfortable. The only down-side is that they're no good in the winter, with snow/slush, but that's true of all breathable shoes and not a fault. I have a different set of water-proof shoes that I use when the weather dictates, but these are much more comfortable.	2015-08-04

I'm pretty much not a sneaker person at all whatsoever. I always feel like I look funny wearing them or that they're too pointy or too sporty or too blah. These shoes I bought on Amazon Prime day on a whim. I never really buy shoes without trying them on first bc I am so picky about my shoes, especially my sneakers. But they were such a good deal and I did need them that I went ahead and bought them. When they arrived I was ecstatic! They fit perfectly and they're super cushy. They have great support for me high arched, ballet trained feet. AND they are probably the coolest looking shoe I've ever owned.  I wish they made them in also a teal and grey color as well bc I like them so much! Highly recommend.	2015-08-04

They are a soft sole not rubber as in the title just to reinforce, which work great around the house or for light walking outside.

Really comfortable, I personally didn't even have to wear them in (although I see others have), and I can happily wear them all day. Great quality, fab-looking boots.

I have been wearing Teva sandals for more than twenty years, and I think the Hurricane is my favorite style. These shoes are very comfortable and provide plenty of support when you're doing a lot of walking. I've just returned from a long vacation during which we walked everywhere. I brought athletic shoes and loafers with me, but ended up wearing my Teva Hurricanes every single day. even when the rest of me was tired and sore, my feet felt fine! Love these.One caveat: keep an eye on the price, it changes from day to day and from seller to seller. I bought these for $30 a few weeks ago, now they are at $60.	2015-08-04

I favor smaller, cross body bags for daily use as I prefer to be hands free. I actually purchased another cross body bag online prior to this purchase and that turned out to be a messenger-sized bag that was too big for what I wanted. This Alicia zipper cross body bag is neither too big nor too small and just right for what I need.<br /><br />It looks really sophisticated and comes with many zippered compartments: there is a zippered compartment on the inside of the bag; there is another zippered compartment on the outside (front facing with the JS logo); there are two zippered compartments on the back; and the top is zippered as well. As much as I like the look and feel of the bag, I am concerned about its durability since the fabric lining on the inside seems rather thin. I don't think this bag is made for stuffing too many things inside. I was able to fit in my long wallet, hairbrush, small tissue pack, my SG 3 Note, my reading glasses and my sunglasses - these all fit into the main compartment. I wasn't able to fit in my water bottle. My keys and ID badge fit into the outside pockets.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this bag for my daily casual needs. I purchased this in black and it looks really sleek and chic.	2015-08-04

Plenty of extra zippers on this style purse for more storage. This one is a beautiful color, size & I like the silver hardware v the gold which many other colors come with.	2015-08-04

This is my second pair of these sandals, and I only had to find another one because a dog chewed through one of the sandals in my first pair. I very nearly cried, because I wear these shoes with absolutely everything! I was so happy when I found them on amazon and could replace the first pair, because these are honestly my favorite shoes I have ever owned. They fit exactly as they should and will last forever (as long as I keep them away from friends' unruly dog's mouths) and go with absolutely anything-- dresses, jeans, shorts, skirts of all colors. These are my summer staple, and you know they are stylish when a woman in her early twenties (me) wears them home and her mom loves them so much that she has to buy a pair also. And yes, we both adore these shoes so much that we sometimes wear them on the same day when I am visiting at home.	2015-08-04

The rain wasn't too heavy this particular morning, but I still got a feel for how the boot would handle.  It was fine.  As with the first pair, while the tab didn't come apart as with this pair, one of the boots was poorly constructed.  You can look at the front of the boot and see how misaligned the sole is from the boot itself.  It's at the front of the boot so you wouldn't notice, but, to me, that speaks to the quality and workmanship.<br /><br />Again, it's a cute boot that wasn't too expensive, purchased more for the style and design than as my go to rainboot.  I will keep them, but if I had to purchase another pair of staple rainboots, it most likely would not be this brand.<br /><br />******************************************************<br /><br />I wanted an ankle boot for the summer months as my taller boots didn't work well with dresses/skirts in the warmer weather.  I saw this particular style of the boot on another site; however, it was not available in my size.  Thankfully, as almost always, it was available on Amazon's.<br /><br />I immediately decided to purchase but was still hesitant as to which size to order.  A lot of reviewers spoke of how the boot ran quite large.  I am a true 7.5 and normally when reviewers state that a shoe runs large, I find that getting my true size is best.  Still, far too may (I would guess about 95%) said it ran large and they ordered a size down.  I thought there has to be truth to this so I went a size down and ordered a 6.<br /><br />When I tried them on with socks (as I will be wearing them with socks) one fit snug (not tight; but snug) and the other felt great.  And even though I didn't try the shoe in a 7, I think the 6 was the way to go.<br /><br />The boot feels solid and the low heel makes it wear more like a shoe than a boot.  It slips on easily and looks super cute.  I read that some said the boot fell apart quickly and the first pair I purchased (hence the title) the tongue on the back of the shoe came apart which is why I replaced them, but until I use them for at least 8 or 9 wears, I can't be sure of their durability.  But I hope they last as, previously stated, these are just meant for a few months during the summer.  They're not my go to boot which I why when it came down to purchasing a similar style by Hunter (I have their tall boots), i much preferred spending half the cost on a shoe that I hope will do the trick..  Will update in a month or so.uickly and the first pair I purchased (hence the title) the tongue on the back of the shoe came apart which is why I replaced them, but until I use them for at least 8 or 9 wears, I can't be sure of their durability.

I've owned many pairs of Teva Sandals. My first pair were so comfortable, that if not for snow, I would wear them year-round. They were very basic, much like this style, but they lacked the anti-microbial footbed and they had to be washed often. That shouldn't be a problem with these, but what I've discovered is that with each new pair I try, they seem to be less and less comfortable.<br /><br />My previous pair were a bit fancier with molded strap connectors, extra padding everywhere and more cushion in the anti-microbial footbed. However, they couldn't be worn for more than a couple of hours of walking without the straps rubbing and causing a blister. So I thought I would return to the simpler style, hoping they would be more comfortable. I really want to like these. Unfortunately, Teva changed the design and they are worse than my previous pair.<br /><br />By creating a more molded anatomic footbed, they added a lip around the edge of the shoe, making the shoe feel narrower. Whereas the straps on my old Tevas would flatten down along the edge, the lip on these sandals don't allow the inside ankle strap to move outward and presses into the inside of my foot each time I take a step. I'm already familiar from my previous pair with what happens after walking for an hour: blister. I included some pictures to illustrate the problem.<br /><br />I thought of cutting away part of the lip right where it hits the strap, but decided I shouldn't have to make modification like that. I chose to simply return them and continue looking, but I thought people should know about this issue. Sorry, Teva, but the &#34;improvements&#34; you've made have only made your sandals worse.	2015-08-04

Aside from the cute design though, these rain boots just don't cut it. They didn't hold up well at all. My 9 year old wore these as backyard shoes daily to walk around our property looking for frogs, toads, lizards, etc. and within the first couple of weeks one of the buckles and the strap tore off completely. Not quite 3 total months later and the top part of the right boot came completely off of the back half of the sole of the boot. She can no longer wear them. They just disintegrated, and weren't overused, she didn't do anything that would cause such wear and tear in such a short amount of time. I've bought my girls rainboots in the past that have gone through both my girls and then even handed down to a friend's kiddo and still held up great through years and several kiddos. Won't buy this brand again, and I don't recommend these boots.	2015-08-04

I developed osteoarthritis after a complex ankle fracture two years ago.  The doctor ordered me to get NON-FLEXIBLE shoes to keep my ankle from moving too much.  It's very hard to find stiff soled shoes in a narrow width.  I finally found the Mesphito Rush oxfords.  They fit very well even though I have narrow feet.  I do wear golf socks with them. They are SO comfortable!  Wore them 10 hours right out of the box!  The leather is supple and soft. They were very expensive and I was terrified before I bought them.  However, they are well worth the price.  My arthritis has calmed down and I am able to do things with my family again.  I don't have to take Ibuprofen all day or go right to bed after work to be comfortable. I'm buying another pair ASAP.	2015-08-04

Fit is perfect and the overall apperance is quiet impressive especially if you wear it with a good slacks. I had many compliments the first time I wore this but the only reason I did'nt gave a 5star is that I think it has tendency to be scratched easily and when it does like what happened with mine, it seem like the outer layer has pealed off thus revealing the second layer which happen to be gray. Maybe because  it's made of a super soft elastic synthetic leather like material and thats it is sensitive to scratches. But ofcourse you can do something about it and so I put some super black polish to cover the flaw a maybe a black marker will do the trick.

So unless you have very skinny legs, do not waste time buying. However, if you do have smaller legs, these boots are beautiful and look very well made. They actually exceeded my expectations of how I thought they were going to look. The foot part of sizing was fine. I wish these fit, because I really liked them. I tried them on and the calf part was squeezing my leg and it was difficult to get them off.	2015-08-04

I thought that I would try a new brand besides my pair of trusty New Balance stalwarts, so after reading the reviews I opted for the ASICS Gel Contend 2 model.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />VERY light. No surprise as it is a running shoe but I use it primarily for kicking around and, in particular, I bought it for use at work. Unfortunately, that didn't work out. (See below.)<br /><br />OUTSTANDING heel control. Nice and tight with no slippage which is just the way that I like it.<br /><br />Nicely padded around the top of the shoe and quite breathable.<br /><br />Heel padding is excellent and I am lovin' it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Too narrow a fit. I bought the 11.5 4E model. Length-wise, it's fine but it is too narrow a fit for me. I wore them around the house and thought that if I took them for a nice walk they would start to break in. Unfortunately after several outings, they're not breaking in whatsoever. Strange. They're not God-awful tight but they are annoying enough that I don't want to wear them for very long. Of course, it's now too late to return them so I'll have to figure out a way to use them for short periods of time and (hopefully) they'll eventually break in. Keep your fingers crossed...<br /><br />Poor padding in the front part of the shoe underneath the foot. Granted, one would expect a running shoe to have extra padding in the heel area (and again, it is superb in the heel) but I expected more in the front part. It is way too thin for my comfort. I will have to seek third party insoles for light duty work which is not what I anticipated having to do.<br /><br />Poor arch support. I don't think that I have any unusually high arches but this is another area of the shoe that bothers me. The arch support is way too shallow for my comfort. Again, I will probably have to seek a third party solution for this.<br /><br />I don't expect a shoe that I buy online to be perfect out of the box but I also think that, at minimum, it should be comfortable enough to wear for extended periods of time. In that respect, these ASICS don't really make the cut. Then again, maybe it just has to do with my fat feet.	2015-08-04

I had another pair that lasted several years - I wore them out!.  I had them in the size bigger, but they were too big.  These fit me much better.

These Tahari's are a 1/4 to 1/2 size on the smaller side.

The sizing is the only reason they're not more than a rating of 3.	2015-08-04

I replied, Thank You and when you get old and cannot bend to tie those young men's shoes do not forget Propet.'  These are so simple and easy that it makes going out a fun time instead another dreaded 'oh, do we have to do there.'  Slip them on with either socks or none and the hook and loop closure cinches the job for each shoe.  No retying or slipping on the untied string.  They have non-slip soles ranging in height from ¬Ω&#34; to 1¬Ω&#34; with a conservative full leather upper.<br /><br />They may not be youth oriented; however, they are a fine pair of walking and usable shoes that should last from wear and even fashion.

I have worn my pair for six months every day after work and have hiked about 40-50 miles with them. They have held together very well. The soles have held up well to the sharp rocks of New Mexico's high desert although I have lost about 1/3 of the tread on the heel. They are ridiculously lite the body of the shoes material can best be described as a super tough Chuck Taylor Allstar like material. If Chuck Taylor's had a super comfortable sole. The sole is a solid single piece and the body is a single layer of material. The are great for wet areas I hiked a slot canyon that had deep standing pools of water and they dried out before I was back to my truck. My one of word warning would be stay away from cactus. Cactus spines go right through the sides of these boots. You might want to take this into account if you live where there are a lot of Rattlesnakes, Cottonmouths, Etc. When mine wear out I plan on repurchasing.	2015-08-04

After a little research I learned that these should be ordered 1/2 size larger than your foot, and that is correct. Asics Omniflex are the best-made wrestling shoes in my opinion... BUT... I consider these new Attacks a step down from the previous model, the Pursuits. The Pursuits were so ahead of their time, and still are, that any successor is going to be judged pretty harshly. The Attacks don't feel as high-quality in terms of material, and design-wise they are actually more conservative than their predecessor's. Still easily one of the best shoes out there, but they have me wondering if Asics has run out of ideas.	2015-08-04

Absolutely gorgeous brightly-coloured shoes (photo true to colour) for my 8 1/2 year old grand-daughter who has not seen them yet - lovely quality and beautifully packaged.<br />Only negative comment I have is it would be so much more helpful if the length of shoe (cm or inches) was shown beside the sizes or even in the sizing chart - I always find foot measurements a surety when buying childrens shoes.<br />I did have a lot of difficulty deciding which size to order - in fact I think they may be a little too big but rather that than too small - she just won't be able to wear them for a while.  Very difficult with so many different countries sizings and being so far away for verbal communication being in NZ .<br />I read the sizing chart but that wasn't any help as all it offered was:  US Size, UK Size, EU Size, Japan BUT NO ACTUAL FOOT MEASUREMENTS unless there was somewhere else I was meant to look.<br />Thoroughly recommend these lovely shoes to anyone looking to purchase.	2015-08-04

I agree with the other lady that they make a very annoying slapping sound when walking, too. I think they would be good for vacations, though, as you wouldn't need to pack many shoes.

He loved this dressy new style.  He finds the inside heel material stiff and somewhat ruff.  It's digging into his heels and they're uncomfortable to wear.  He has never had this problem with a prior pair.  I think the leather on the back of the shoe is making the heel much less flexible.  Does someone have a suggestion to make these comfortable?  He loves the style, but not the discomfort.	2015-08-04

These shoes are great for sprints and track work, maybe not so much for roads and definitely not for trails. Absolutely no support - these are for neutral runners and no one else.

They have elastics under the cords that you can't really adjust but they make the shoes more fitted.

One thing I loved about the shoes is how light they are.	2015-08-04

Also they are comfortable and I find my feet aren't cramping by day's end.  Do they breathe? No, not really. Be prepared for pungent feet. I get regular pedicures so it's not as bad but somebody that doesn't take care of their feet might need to keep Lotrimin on hand or something.<br /><br />I would never sacrifice safety for something that can be taken care of with good personal hygiene though.

Parts of the wallet, mainly the coin part, are plastic and I don't expect it to last very long. The credit card slots are exceptionally small and tight making it difficult to get cards in and out.  The Buxton wallet that this was replacing was soft and supple and had lots of room.  I used that wallet for 8 years.<br />I'll be surprised if this one lasts one year !  Had I had seen this wallet in a store and felt it, I would not have purchased it.  It smells like leather but other than that it is not the same quality I am used to in a Buxton.  Its either a cheap imitation or Buxton has lowered their standards when it comes to leather goods.<br />PS...I just noticed, on the back side of the wallet in small print, it says Genuine Leather EXTERIOR  (the remainder of the entire wallet is plastic/pleather).  In all fairness, that should be noted in the description so customers don't think they are buying an all leather wallet.	2015-08-04

I got these boots for two reasons, to have protective shoes at work and while riding my motorcycle. I've had the boots for a little over a week now and have worn them almost every day since I got them. While the manufacturer's propaganda about wearing like a tennis shoe is a bit over-stated, these are the most comfortable protective shoes I've ever owned. They fit right out of the box, and the edge of the steel doesn't dig into my toes when I walk around all day like other boots I've used.	2015-08-04

US	51310713	RIZ68WZH1REAT	B00EP0ACS6	936749014	adidas Men's Greensider Golf Shoe	Shoes	5	1	1	N	Y	Great, lightweight golf shoes	These were my first foray away from traditional golf shoes. Prior to these, I'd always worn the all leather style which were heavy and didn't breathe very well. These were the exact opposite. My first impression when I pulled them out of the box was how incredibly light they were. And they looked good. When I was deciding between shoes, I was leaning toward the style that looked like running shoes because I knew they'd be comfortable. But I've never really liked the look of running shoes with nice shorts. These seem to bridge that gap between the running shoe style and the more formal all-leather style.<br /><br />Putting them on  felt like putting on a pair of lightweight running shoes. And they felt equally at home on the pavement as they did on the grass. Being summertime, I wasn't going to be testing how they held up in wet conditions but there was still a noticeable amount of moisture on the ground from the sprinklers and my feet remained completely dry. And, unlike my old shoes where, after 18 holes of walking, I couldn't wait to get them off and put on some flip flops, with these shoes I felt that I could have happily worn them the rest of the day. And amazingly, I had just pulled these out of the box and played a full round in them and my feet couldn't have been happier.	2015-08-04

Go Ahead and Pass on These - I Wish I Had	As posted by a million other people, these shoes definitely squeak. I've tried the baby powder under the liner trick, and that does seem to help although it wears off. I stuck with them through that because I really think they look great. However, recently after about 2 months of moderate wear I noticed that the threading along the toe box was coming undone, and the fabric near laces is starting to fray (I'm assuming because of the laces rubbing back and forth when I walk in them). So it seems that I now have a squeaky pair of shoes that are poorly/cheaply made and now I'm trying to remember why I kept them in the first place. My advice is pass on these for something else. Disappointed, I had come to expect more from Merrill based on past experiences.	2015-08-04

Color is oatmeal canvas, not white leather or even faux leather as advertised, fit of shoe is extremely narrow. I have a pair of reef leather flip flops also in size 8 and they are actually wider than these shoes as well as a bit longer which was not an issue for me since I typically wear a 7.5. My sandals are a bit loose so I couldn't have imagined the shoes not fitting. I purchased these for a trip that I was unable to wear them on and now have missed my return window due to being gone much of July. I would NOT recommend buying these online, you must purchase in store to try on or you may be disappointed. I would appreciate it if the seller would arrange a return as these are unworn in box still and I will not be able to wear them. I do believe this is my first 1-star amazon review and I hope it is my last. Please excuse my worn sandals in the photos for reference as my reef sandals are some of my favorite shoes.	2015-08-04

Now, having said that, I will say that I'm new to trail running and Mud Runs, however.... I just completed the DC Spartan Sprint and let me just tell you there literally waist deep. These shoes were the bomb!  Here are the points of this shoe that really stand out for me:<br /><br />Performance:  The majority of the 4.5 miles was spent going wither up or down some very slippery trails and where others had to do the sit and slid, I was able to walk/run down the slopes.  The &#34;claws&#34; on the sole really allow you to dig in and grab the mud.  On the earth berms they had constructed, by the time I got to these they were worn into an extremely slick and unforgiving obstacle that I could not imagine trying to get up with regular shoes like I saw so many people sporting.  They really struggled and without a helping hand I don't think they would have ever gotten over these hills.  I was able to stab a toe in and power up and over these maybe not with ease but certainly faster and easier than others.  I just simply could not have imagined running this race without these shoes.<br /><br />Fit: I have a narrow foot and these Inov's fit like a glove!  They're much slimmer than a standard &#34;D&#34; size shoe and really hug your foot.  Let me just reference the Mud again in the Spartan race.  I saw many people along the way lose their shoes to the mud.  One poor guy lost a shoe about 1/4 of a mile into the race and was not able to recover it.  He ran the rest of the race (I hope he made it) on only one shoe.  By contrast, I never worried about my Inov's coming off.  Having that secure feeling is worth a million when you're clawing a 1/4 mile through mud up to your hips.<br /><br />Clean up:  I've worn these for two Mud races now.  The Spartan and a Warrior Dash.  Both times I came home washed them thoroughly outside with the hose pipe, removed the inner soles and ran them through the wash them left them out in the sun to dry.  They've done amazing!  check out the before and after clean up pictures.  I've been very please with how well they clean up.<br /><br />Overall, Just a freaking great shoe!  I just could not be happier.  If you're doing any kind of Mud Run...Get these!g!  check out the before and after clean up pictures.

That marketing is a bit misleading.  The bag is extremely well made and it has a lot more room than one would imagine upon first glance. It has been constructed for durability. There are three zippered pockets (two on the outside and one on the inside). In addition, there are a few other open pockets on the inside.  There is a zipper on top to secure the articles inside. However, this top zipper leaves a small opening on both sides, so if you have any small articles, they can fall out of the bag.<br /><br />The biggest issues I have with the bag are that it will NOT hold a laptop computer and it is definitely a bag designed for women, not men. The bag will hold a tablet, but it will not hold a laptop computer, so don't be fooled by the title or advertising. In addition, the DESERTWOLF VINTAGE CANVAS TOTE BAG is a very feminine looking bag. For instance, there is a faux leather belt in the front with some Chinese writing on it and there is a label in the very center of the front of the bag. These are both designs that are typical of female purses and totes. In short, it's something I would think about getting for my girlfriend, but not something I would ever purchase myself.<br /><br />Overall, the DESERTWOLF VINTAGE CANVAS TOTE BAG is a tote bag that has been designed for durability and longevity. However, it will not fully carry a normal laptop computer and has been designed with some feminine features making it not something that most men would probably use.<br /><br />I received a sample of this item from the manufacturer for examination and possible review.	2015-08-04

Perfect boots for wet or snowy weather! Rubber traction on the soles provide stability for walking from car to building, and look fashionable enough that I got compliments every time I wore them! Very comfortable so can wear all day long. I'm considering buying another pair for when this set wears out. I gave four stars because the buckles on the ankle part are showing some wear/tear around the buckle holes, as the fabric is not as thick (although please note, you don't buckle/unbuckle these to get the boots on/off, but you can tighten them if desired since these are real, working buckles). I also noticed the toe area gets easily scuffed, leaving scratch marks in the fabric. However, I had a long walk from the university parking lot to my building during some pretty harsh snowy weather this past season, so overall, I appreciated that they provided excellent warmth and protection along with comfort AND style.	2015-08-04

They are comfortable and hug the feet so there isn't a lot of flip/flop noise nor dragging noise; if you have downstairs neighbors, they will be pleased. I bought them to protect my toes from furniture at home; they are wide and have a bumper around the edge which really protects toes from accidents.	2015-08-04

Tighter across the foot, looser in the heel.  I ordered my regular size as I have with my other keen sandals..  Since these are leather I suppose they will stretch a little with wear, they are not uncomfortable.  A half size larger would take care of foot but make the heel looser.  I wanted a more traditional brown leather  sandal for fall and these will work.  For comfort I would go with the Whisper. My grey whisper is my summer go to . I am redoing my backyard and a keen sandal  is bulletproof. Rock, dirt, whatever.  Great traction and toe protection.  Hose off  and go.  I also wear them for errands and sometimes out to lunch.	2015-08-04

Pros - same Ugg luxurious comfort and all day wearability, LOVE the color options and very cute design. Cons - the opening seems a little big on my legs - I am used to the snugger fit of the classic short, mini and tall and this is a little breezy. I actually tried looping the elastic around the button twice to see if it would make it tighter, which it did a little so I have left it that way. This begs me to wonder if by doing so, the elastic will stretch out faster and at some point, will either break or get so loose as to not be useable. I would have rather seen the top a tiny bit more fitting and perhaps a faux button and loop rather than a real one becuz if it does at some point break, the whole boot will come open. My only other slight concern is that when I used my cell phone QR scanner to check the QR code on the inside label of the boot, it does not come up with Ugg verifying that it is a genuine Ugg product. After numerous tries, I get the same site which is a link to Decker and Ugg and a few others along with a privacy notice link. I believe this perhaps is due to the fact that Deckers Outdoor Corp is the seller of this boot and since Decker owns Ugg, the QR code may not act the same as some of my other pairs. I still think the pair is genuine - I have enough of them to know the quality, but it would have been nice if I would have been able to 100% verify it on Ugg's own site. As usual, you will want to order one size down from your regular size.	2015-08-04

You need to break these bad boys in!  These are my second pair and by default leather sandals for all occasions.  I broke mine in my wearing them for increasingly long durations. The leather warps and changes colors, especially on the bottom which is why I chose these colors instead of the lighter ones, since the light ones tend to look icky when they're darkened from pressure.  The braid is a nice differentiator from other rainbows.  It adds a feminine touch that allows me to wear it with dresses.	2015-08-04

This is my 4 set of Rainbow flip flops. I've been wearing them for 10 years now, and wear them constantly when I'm not at in the office. After my dog chewed through my most recent pair, I had to replace them ASAP. They require some breaking in; the strap is very uncomfortable for the first few weeks. After the break in period, though, I'd never wear another flip flop. They're comfortable for walking and standing, and work well with many outfits. They don't have much arch support, which matches my preference, but I can see the lack of arch support being an issue for others.	2015-08-04

I tried on the same boot in a retail store so I knew my size but ordered online for the better price. I was lucky enough to get the boot the day I was leaving, so kudos to Amazon for that! After getting out here and wearing them for a few hours I was uncomfortable and my feels and legs are sore. I went out and bought inserts to help with cushioning but that made them fit too tight. I ordered a 7 and that fit great in the store. The 6.5 was too small. Since the only shoes I brought on vacation were those and flip flops I had to wear them ( can't wear flip flops on a motorcycle all day). I'm wondering what your policy is for unsatisfied customers? Im so disappointed because they are raved about for their comfort and quality and I spent a lot of money. do you accept returns of used boots? I would even be willing to exchange and try the Justin boots that are suppose to be more comfortable but overall these boots are advertised for their comfort. I had ordered another pair that I am returning because they were too small. Anyway, please email me at angurba07@aol.com.	2015-08-04

My 5 year old wore them at Disney for 3 days and her feet never hurt. She has very narrow feet and is very particular about how her shoes feel. The closure is easy, and the shoe does not rub any part of her foot or ankle which is very important! The tongue on the inside is already getting some of the silver rubbed off unfortunately (we've owned them for a week), but once you put the shoe on, the strap hides it. I know she will be very sad when she outgrows them. OH, and she LOVES the light up part and stomps her feet triumphantly to anyone who she wishes to show it to. She also loves that Anna is on one side and Elsa is on the other, which helps her know which foot each shoe goes on.	2015-08-04

After at least at least one thousand miles in them I had to get a new pair of super duty all purpose shoes.(I still have them and they are serviceable) I hike,walk, work, and do lots of spur of thee moment activities in my athletic shoes. They have to be able to hold up to a lot of different kinds of abuse and weather conditions. These fit exactly as what my usual shoe size runs. The toe box is roomy and I have wider feet. They feel great and they are light considering the support and  protection they offer. It feels like I'm wearing ultralight weight, very low cut boots instead of sneakers, which offers a feeling of security. They are very breathable since its gortex and have very sharp look.	2015-08-04

My sister has a pair in a size 8, which is the size I normally wear. After trying them on, I felt that they were a hair too long, and going down a half size would better suit my foot in terms of length. So, I ordered a 7.5. While the length of the sandal was correct, the rest of it was a poor fit. The sides were a bit narrow (I've got wider feet to begin with), and the top strap was so snug I had a hard time getting the Velcro to secure itself. It was just too tight for my lady hobbit feetses. That being said, the strap over the toes fit just fine. I ended up returning them and ordering the size I normally wear, and should have ordered, the 8. The length, as I've said, is a little long for my liking, but the rest of the sandal fits so well that I'm more than willing to overlook it. The straps fit perfectly over the top of the foot, and the footbed is nicely cushioned, providing a perfect amount of support without feeling like my feet sink with each step (I hate that). I highly recommend these, just remember that they may run a tad long. If you've got longer feet, you'll be set. If you don't like them that way, I'd suggest a different sandal.<br /><br />Update: I love these! I can wear them all day, multiple days in a row, and they are still ridiculously comfortable! No blisters, no tender spots. The straps stretched a tad, but I needed them to. They fit like a glove.	2015-08-04

Then, I stopped at OfficeMax and Verizon before heading home to take my dogs out. The shoes should have stood up to the activity involved in retail shopping and walking around my yard, but when I went inside and took off my shoes, there was a large hole in the left one, a hole large enough for me to stick my finger through (see attached photo). I paid $130 for these shoes, so I expected them to last longer than 45 days. I wouldn't recommend them.	2015-08-04

I am on my feet all day for work and I was having a lot of foot pain at the ball of my foot. My doctor suggested I get something with a higher arch and these are by far the best arches I could find for the money. They felt a bit odd to wear the first day because they do have a high arch, but after one or two days you really get use to them. I bought size 9-10 women's since they are cheaper than size 7-8 and I cut them and they fit perfectly. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Repurchased a few more for my other shoes and slippers.	2015-08-04

I have had a pair of the Arcopedico shoes before and they really help when you have plantar fasciitis.  Like this pair but the band across the top is a little tight - not too flexible - but I still like the shoes.  Hopefully, it will loosen with time as I wear these shoes. I gave it 4 stoars only because of the band being tight.  Ordinarily I would have given these shoes a 5.	2015-08-04

I wear a US 10, and I purchased this Camper in a 41.  I'll be wearing thin dress socks or tights with these because there isn't room for thick boot socks. These are an exact size for a 10.  I will say that some Campers in a 41 are snug on me and some are loose, this one falls in between.  If walking a long distance, I would put inserts into them. But for office days, they will be fine.  There is a slightly padded insole, so its not totally flat and hard. I gave it five stars because they are attractive, and will wear well.  I don't count off for heel and arch support because I feel that those are my own issues and not everyone else has them. Granted, it is the middle of summer, so I have not worn these all day either, but with the Camper reputation, I feel confident in speaking about how they will wear.  I should also say, they are completely lace only, there is no side zipper.  The top back of the boot has a slit of sorts for comfort (flex).	2015-08-04

I took both pair to a shoe repair shop and the cobbler said that there is no way to glue or sew the soles to the upper.

So, I ordered same one and was glad to wear it again. HOWEVER, it was broken just after 1 month!! I barely walk wearing it though. Since I'm staying overseas, I couldn't return or fix it it. And then my husband reordered same one for me cuz I really loved it.  BUT IT WAS BROKEN AGAIN. (the string part) I'll never buy this one again.

This shoe would have been PERFECT had it not been for Naturalizer's funky measurements! I had previously purchased the Carlita sandal, 12M, but the sandal was a bit too big (I am an 11) so I gave them to my sister which fit her perfectly. So, I ended up ordering a size 11W - same sandal thinking that - like Goldilocks, I would find the perfect fit given that the 12M was too big but fearing that the 11M would be too small (I have wide feet). The shoes arrived and with bated breathe, I ripped open the box and had a &#34;Cinderella Stepsister&#34; moment as the shoe DID NOT FIT AT ALL. I checked the label multiple times thinking that the store had mistakenly sent me 11N or an 11M but NOPE, there clearly printed was an &#34;11W&#34;. I have ordered PLENTY of Naturalizer shoes in the past and have NEVER had this issue before! Either my foot had grown ever wider or Naturalizers sizing changed.<br /><br />Determined to get these sandals, I came on Amazon and found a comparable Capricorn sandal that also came in an 11WW. SCORE, right? WRONG. While the color is lovely and the shoe so comfortable, the shoe is STILL TOO BIG (my perpetual dilemma)! The width is perfect but the strap is WAY TOO BIG. Unlike a fellow customer, I guess I have the opposite dilemma of having big, wide feet bu with small ankles thus it feels as if I am one wrong step away from leaving my shoe on a DC metro platform - literally, I can slip in and out of my shoe without ever unlatching the strap.<br /><br />*SIGH* Alas, I am keeping the shoes as I can't part from the comfort and am weary of ordering again. Just know that the sizing is funky and pray that Naturalizer standardizes their sizing.	2015-08-04

This is the third pair of Polo sunglasses I have owned since 2001. These sunglasses last a long time if you take care of them. I am a big fan of the wrap around shade, and I am glad to see that the slightly larger rounder wrap has come back. These glasses cover a lot compared to my last pair which were smaller and more square. It was nice to have the extra coverage. One complaint I did have, and it may be specific to me, is that when ever I smiled wearing these, my cheek pushed up the right lens. I know it is picky, but there it is. The Polo logo is a bit large and guady for my taste. I wish there were some pictures of different faces wearing these shades so you could get an idea of their size when worn. The case is a soft one which seems like it will offer protection from scratches but not getting crushed in your backpack. My old pair of Polos came with a sturdy springloaded wooden case which offered extra protection.	2015-08-04

Love the look and overall feel of this shoe, but due to the nanoweb on and around the toebox there is really little to no stretch. A half size up would have been perfect.

However putting a heel support in it and a thicker sock they are just fine.  They are brown leather on the front and a brushed suede on the back of the boot. Love the heel height, just perfect for most day wear.  Have not worn all day yet... They are soft so a little slouchy which is fine.  I have a 14 inch calf so they are perfect and go on just fine with a little room to spare.  Once I get to wear they all day I am positive I will love them, just trying them on for an hour or so they were very comfortable.  The sole is slick so scuff them up or you will slide.  I had purchased two pair the Black and the Brown.  Kept the brown the black was more charcoal coloring not black enough for my liking in a boot.  The price was amazing, sure I will have them for years to come.	2015-08-04

I don't wear heels too often, so these didn't get a ton of wear.  They aren't very comfortable if you're walking around much, but working in an office where I spend a lot of time at my desk they worked fine.<br /><br />The heel strap rubs and isn't very smooth so it causes some chafing.  The big issue was that these broke with one summer of me wearing them once or twice a week.  One of the straps going over the toe completely separated from the sole.  Again this is with normal and pretty minimal use.  I would say you get what you pay for, but I've had better quality shoes from discount stores that were almost half the price.  Chinese Laundry has never been a brand that has lasted me long, but these fit my need so I decided to give it a shot.  Not worth it.	2015-08-04

I bought these in the gold and they look pretty true to color. As the previous reviews it said they are tight and the cats and runabout have a size smaller it was perfect for me because they don't sell 6 1/2. Tell is a bit more grounded than I expected but overall a good boot for a costume.	2015-08-04

These fit slightly large, which is perfect for me, because a true 8 would be too small, but a 9 would be way too big.  Straps are comfortable, especially because they don't run between the toes. There's not much cushioning of the footbed (which would take them to 5 star territory), so I probably wouldn't wear them for a long day of standing/walking, but they seem like they'll be perfect for normal day-to-day wear.	2015-08-04

Great quality boots all around, and very comfortable. Will be great for building duck blinds in the fall temperatures, and with the 800 grams of Thinsulate should do just fine on chilly days in the deer stand as well. $130 pair of LaCrosse boots for a little over $70?

We have been regular buyers of this model for our 7 year old for the last several years.  It took some time to get used to Reef's numbering system as it related to the sizes advertised, but once you get over that little hurdle, it's good.  Reef doubles up on sizes, and sells a &#34;13/1&#34; size as &#34;13&#34;, and a 2/3 as a &#34;2&#34;, and so on.  We hoped we could skip a size this time around when he outgrew the 11/12, and started by ordering the 2/3.  Way too big, so we ordered the 13/1 and it's great, with some room to grow.  Keeping both pairs because he will grow into the next size for next year...or earlier, since he wears these year round for swim team.  Great product.	2015-08-04

However, I wear size 9.5-10w and ordered the 9.5 wide. They are way too long. I did not realize how long they were until I got to work and my heels kept coming out of them. I had to put in heel cushions and foot bed cushions to wear these shoes. For me a size 9 has always been to short, but a size 9 in this shoe would have fit me well.	2015-08-04

I used them by stuffing them into an old pair of sneakers that had worn-out insoles, and they did give me comfort and helped with my plantar fasciitis. My only complaint is that they are WAY too big for the range of sizes that they are supposed to fit! I think they are supposed to fit Women's sizes 7-10, but there is no way you're squishing these things into a size 7!  I had to trim them way down, which wasn't easy, because of the layered materials. What the product really needs is guides under the sole for cutting out the appropriate shoe size, or they need to make different insoles for each size.	2015-08-04

US	24669840	R4BW85AAF6EMO	B003YAGV9M	642898743	Deluxe Kayak Cover	Shoes	5	3	3	N	Y	Quality and features were just what I was looking for in a storage, but not travel cover.	After a carport fire that left me without storage for my 14' kayak I bought this to cover my boat at a marina in open kayak rack storage. I wanted to protect my boat from the sun as well as disguise it. I also have a 15.5' boat that will wear this cover in the winter. I am very impressed with the quality of the material. The cover is well sewn together and the straps on the bow and stern ends easily adjust the cover from the 15.5 to the 14. It is not a snug fit, so if you are looking for a travel cover look elsewhere or get a custom tailored one. However, for storage purposes the quality and fit are exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price. I would buy another one if needed. Be sure to compensate for a rudder in the cover length. The 14-16' accommodated my 15.5 rudder with ease. If you have a 16' boat, you may need to size up. I was lucky that one size fit both of my boats.	2015-08-04

I was happy with the customer service from the rep at our local baby store but these shoes have proved to be poor quality as well.  My almost 2 year old daughter has worn them for less than 3 months, and not daily as she had Keen sandals she wore a lot as well, and the Velcro will only lightly stick as the top velcro strap became really fluffy.  I loved See Kai Run shoes for my two older children but the quality seems to have gone downhill and these will be my last pair of See Kai Run shoes.	2015-08-04

It's not &#34;stiff&#34; or floppy....just in between. The perforations are beautiful. I love the dark brown handles on too...I can wear this into fall. And it's not &#34;white&#34; either...it's a pretty cream, so it's definitely a go after labor day weekend. I didn't expect it to be such a messenger bag size...it's pretty big. I thought it would be more of a &#34;purse&#34;....look at the dimensions so you know. When I wear it hung around my hips, it covers the front part of my hip and part of my rear. But it shapes nicely the my body so it doesn't feel like it's in the way. But it's definitely heavier than what I'm used to...but the cotton straps make for a really comfortable wear around the shoulders. As a student going back to college, I think it will be perfect...Ipad, snacks, etc. There is a cross body bag that is a sister to this design, I considered getting it, it's a little cheaper, I just didn't like the clunky shape of it. I really like how this one folds over on itself. A pro is that those two zippered pockets are easy to access and super functional...roomy so I can put phone and keys in there so I don't have to dig deep to the bottom of my purse like I usually do with other purses...like a big black hole.<br /><br />My only concern is that I probably shouldn't wear this with dark blue denim or anything that will rub and transfer color. I had a fossil bag before and I wore a pair of jeans and it turned the one side of my purse a blueish hue, and it was a cream/bone color. I might consider finding a leather protector, but I don't want to risk changing to color of the fabric.	2015-08-04

I would agree with some of the other comments that these boots run about half a size to a full size large (compared to Nikes).  They felt a little narrow when I first got them but once I broke them in they fit like a dream.  It feels like the boot molds to your foot after a couple weeks and only gets better from there. One thing other people complained about was the color being litter than the pictures and I would agree with that also.  But I would note that if you put some type of leather preservative on them they will darken right up and I think they get darker with use too.  I gave them 5 stars but I do have two small complaints.<br /><br />One is the sole material is soft.  I work in a shop where there are metal chips and other small sharp debris on the floor and the metal shavings will dig into the soles.  Once the soles get worn in they stiffens up a bit.  I don't notice it as much any more but occasionally I'll get a straggler.  I can't fault the boots too much because the shop I work in has concrete floors and the softer soles make them comfortable to wear.  I've worn other boots and by the end of the day my feet were very sore.  So I like having the soft sole for the comfort but I don't like it because it collects crap. You win some you lose some I guess.<br /><br />Secondly I wish the boot laces that came with they boots were a little more durable. I've had my boots for about 4 months now and wear them 5 days a week.  After 4 months one lace has worn through the outer sheathing and half of the inner fibers.  The other lace is right behind it and should be replaced too.  This is on par with other boot laces I've used but I'm in the mind set that when I spend a pretty penny on something I should have high quality all around.<br /><br />All in all they are great boots.  They fit great, feel great and the steel toe does bother my toes.  I would definitely recommend these boots.	2015-08-04

I got married in Tulum, Mexico. Before we left I realized I didn't have any good flip flops to wear during the ceremony which was going to be held on the beach. After  looking at a few places, I happened into PacSun, and proceeded to find the best flip flops that I've ever owned, hands down. In the days leading up to the ceremony, we had a couple of excursions with our friends who accompanied us to Mexico. These flip flops were worn both days, and had miles put on them,  over all types of different terrains, be it at the ruins at Tulum, or in and out of wet environments while ziplining, scuba diving, and cave exploration.<br /><br />These flip flops amazed me then,  in that they were brand new, and didn't tear my feet to shreds after miles in the Mexico heat, and I have gone through multiple pairs since.<br /><br />My favorite thing is they don't actually flip or flop as I walk. I am not ready to retire to sandals and socks, but I don't exactly want to be flopping around either.<br /><br />Excellent product, highly recommended!	2015-08-04

I would rather them be slightly tight as they are now so they can break in perfect.  All shoes break in somewhat.  I would buy them again if I had to.  I appreciate companies that make wide shoes!!	2015-08-04

Awesome for trail running, backpacking, scrambling, bouldering, and working out in the gym. I usually get between 450 and 600 miles on them before the treading wears out which on average is about 4 to 5 months. Walking in concrete and asphalt will destroy the treads quickly. The problem is once there is some wear on vital treads my feet don't land evenly and I wnd up with knee pains. Once I start feeling knee pains I know my shoes have run their course. I have to argue that these are not water resistant. Countless times I've backpacked theough thick brush and fields with high grass and my everytime my feet were soaking wet. They definitely do not keep my feet dry during a rain fall. On the plus side they do dry relatively fast.	2015-08-04

The design was consistent for about 7 years or so.  The last few years I have not liked the boots as much. The last pair before these were sized too small...I plan to give them to Amvets.  I decided to try one more time before I switched brands.  I've cruised timber in theses a couple of days and they seem to be fine.  I work in piedmont conditions with lots of slope.  The heel fits good and the larger toe box give room for swelling.  Interesting that they seem shorter than my other pairs.  The do not look like the picture.  Soles do not have the pronghorn pattern either but I can live with all that.  They do the job.  I'll get a year out of them.  Oh, I'm glad the pull loop is back.	2015-08-04

Figuring it was Florida, I thought i'd pick up a good pair of shades with Polarized lenses.  I looked at several different Oakley frames and prices.  I really liked the Badman design but i didn't feel like paying $400 bucks.  Then I came across the Tinfoil design.  I liked the design and shape of the frame as well as the brushed aluminum finish.  I was a little concerned that I hadn't actually tried them on but when they arrived my concerns were quickly put to rest and I knew I had made the right choice. They are lightweight, have a comfortable fit,  are very stylish imho and of course they're the Oakley brand so you know you're getting good quality.  Funny thing about the trip is that it rained most of the time I was down there but I made sure they got use in rain and shine.  Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend them.	2015-08-04

I know they could make them better I have a $30 pair of px22's that fit comfortably and the adjusting bands are made of thick strong plastic. I feel like the more expensive it is the crappier the design and build of the headset they need to put more work into making these headsets not only sound great but feel great to and not be made cheaply.	2015-08-04

It does what it's made for. I happily purchased this expecting more from what I got. When I first received it, I was wondering why it didn't work. I looked it up and found out that you had to install drivers. I installed them and it started working. It worked great, sadly I ran into a problem. Sometimes the game I was playing would lag for a second and the wireless receiver would stop working. I believe this isn't my PCs fault; I run games well, and this would only happen when the receiver was plugged in; this was indeed the receivers fault. This glitch happens quite often, which is why I gave it a three out of five stars. Other then that this product is overall, not bad. I would recommend this if you're on a tight budget.	2015-08-04

When i say collecting I mean new in box, and american version. This is my first time buying an amiibo off of Amazon because I've had pretty decent luck hunting for them in stores so far but from what I've read, you're playing roulette by buying them off amazon. Whether it be getting it in an non American import, or coming damaged. Well I got my charizard in English like it said, The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because the Box was a little damaged. Whoever sold this to me has had the amiibo for quite some time I'm guessing because the corners were soggy and there were minor creases on the front cardboard as well as a pretty bad scratch in the plastic almost to the point where it breaks through. All and all I will continue to look in stores and not support the scalpers as much as I possibly can.	2015-08-04

So when I was offered the opportunity to try this Arc Charger I was stoked! Finally we could charge both of our controllers at the same time!!!<br /><br />It comes in a small box and there is no assemble required, all you do is plug it in and hook your controllers up to it and let them charge! It took my controllers about an hour or so to charge. It's very sleek and doesn't take up a lot of room at all and it looks awesome next to our system. The controllers fit very snug and hook in very easily! There is also 2 USB ports on the side of the Arc Charger which is very convenient for charging your phones or whatever you need to charge while charging your controllers. While your controller is hooked up to the charger you still can use it, I tried this when I first got it, I hooked my controllers up while watching a movie and I could still start stop and pause while the controllers being hooked up.<br /><br />This Arc Charger is essential for any gamer, I highly recommend getting this for your PS4 controllers. They charge fast and they look really good sitting next to your console. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-04

When plugged in, after 2-3 minutes of use using high graphic games, the PSU would shut down and restart, I believe to heat. I tried other high intensity graphic games with same results. It does, however, work on simpler games (for young children). Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the quality. Just to make sure it was not the console itself, I purchased a used Microsoft brand PSU from a game store, plugged it in and it worked with EVERYTHING! without any issues. So if you are playing high intensity graphic games you may experience the same issues.	2015-08-04

I've only used it for a day or two, so far, but It is responsive (a bit too much in some cases; see below), comfortable and makes Elite Dangerous a joy to play. It seems to be very sturdy and was very easy to set up. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars as I did find one downside, but not enough, in my opinion, to take it to 4 stars. The precision needed for enabling full manual control in Elite Dangerous (Flight Assist Off) is not there but it could be if Thrusmaster's T.A.R.G.E.T software supported this device. But for the price, this is definitely worth the money and I would recommend anyone on a budget to purchase it. Ideally I would recommend Thrustmaster's Warthog, but not everyone has that kind of money.	2015-08-04

Very easy to set-up and use.  Great sound quality!  Very comfortable!  And then the problems started after a few short months.  The pain problem with the headphones is they NEVER should have made them fordable.  The part that folds uses a small metal pin, held on the sides by a plastic channel.  About 2 weeks ago the right side plastic channel cracked causing the pin to come out.  The only way to keep it usable was to reinforce the outer frame of it with a strip of metal, held in place by DUCT tape.  Then this evening the left side plastic channel gave way, just like the right side did previously.  Again I have to reinforce it with a metal strip with DUCT tape.<br />Keep in mind this was being used by a teenager that has been using PlayStation models since 2003!  He does not beat on his equipment, and has never had an equipment failure as bad as this.  &#34;SONY get rid of the folding aspect, and maybe your product will hold up better to daily use&#34;	2015-08-04

Quite impressed with them great sound quality. All the music I played on it sounded perfect. I listen to Alt/Hip-hop and nothing was distorted. Range was good for about 20 to 30 ft, then it would go in and out which is normal it's not going to go 100ft or something crazy. Reason it only got 4 stars was that I learned it's not compatible with consoles... :( Mic works great just have it on right and not muted lol. These are great for wearing around the house listening to music and PC gaming but not console so keep that in mind. If they were console compatible these things would be perfect!!! Keep looking if you want to have an all-around headset. Great buy though if you don't want to buy a much pricier version of Astros.	2015-08-04

For those curious about the height of the figure/plush, it stands about 3 inches tall. The detail of the amiibo is astounding. The eyes, rather than being painted on, are embroidered. It has a cute little tushtag that reads Yoshi in the color matching the body (so mine was blue). There also a loop on the Yarn Yoshi's head, presumably to slip a ball-chain through (or, I suppose, a really thin carabiner). The NFC chip is housed on the bottom of the plush within a little patch the has the same &#34;amiibo&#34; mark and Nintendo logo as the traditional amiibo.<br />The quality of the plush, on the whole, is just fine. The seams look fine and the embroidery around the eyes is nice and clean. My one minor issue is that stitching around Yoshi's back-shell puckers a little bit at the bottom edges but I don't think that effects the integrity of the plush at all.	2015-08-04

As it turned out, neither cable worked on the N64, but they worked perfectly on the SNES and Gamecube. Unbeknownst to me when I purchased these, component cables for the Gamecube cost about what you could pay for a New 3DS XL, so I decided to stick with the S-Video connection for that console after all.<br /><br />Works great for SNES and Gamecube, but definitely a bummer that they didn't work on the N64.	2015-08-04

While it worked, I loved it.  The smoothness is unparalleled but unfortunately the durability isn't.  Customer service, although far from stellar is reportedly better than Fanatec, which ironically is the direction I took post t300.  I'm a proud owner of a CSW V2 now -- I figure I'll start with better build quality with the hopes of avoiding customer service altogether.  Fingers crossed.<br /><br />tl;dr<br />It's difficult to pinpoint exactly why my t300 failed but I have some ideas. The first is manufacturing.  Cheap(er) materials and cheap(er) components can really bite back.  This is clearly illustrated by the differences between the t500 and t300 (pedals notwithstanding).  It you ever get a chance to drive the former, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Along the same vein, heavy backorders at the time of purchase (xmas holiday) forced higher production, likely beyond their capacity.  Not a good recipe to maintain QC.<br /><br />But the biggest culprit IMO is inadequate cooling.  Many first-time wheel users search for unnecessarily heavy FFB, which can caused severe clipping, which in turn prompts an even heavier setting.  Moreover excessive heat causes FFB fade and yet another reason a user might bump up the settings.  This cycle taxes the motor (especially cheap ones) particularly on long play sessions.  I'm certainly not saying having a cool t300 will guarantee unlimited durability, but there's a good chance it will extend it.<br /><br />A couple more suggestion regarding FFB and heat is to find your personal feeback setting from the bottom up...meaning start from zero and work your way up until you hit the sweet spot.  This way you may find you might not need as much FFB as you think.  And please pay attention to the heat exhaust in correlation to the the level of FFB.  This may give you insight into when to let it cool off.  It's also good practice to leave the wheel base plugged in after your gaming session to allow the fan to continue to exhaust the heat.  Note that no exhaust may indicate fan falure too, which in this case means stop playing immediately !no exhaust may indicate fan falure too, which in this case means stop playing immediately !	2015-08-04

Although, i personnally will always reutrn to Soul Calibur 1 for nastalgia's sake and to Soul Blade for many other reasons. Soul Calibur 2 made mistakes with content like getting rid of Rock and Hwang but instead having Barbarian and Thief, respectively. But made up for it by introducing Talim, Raphael, and  Yun Sung. Also by fan service of Tekken's Heihachi being guest featured, the only character in SC to fight with his bare hands! Also, they brought back the concept of the weapons having different attributes that affected gameplay. Or you could use standard effects with any skin.  I never liked the choice of art design for this one. The beautiful textures found in SC1 took a back seat to the ubiquitous pastel surface colors of the models.  This edition contains the second and last time we got to see exhibition theater, where characters demonstrate their technique forms for you.<br /><br />The fighting was intense, fast paced, and merciless. All characters that returned had expanded move sets. Many included different stances to lead into other oppurtunities. Plus, they made more substantial stages that were more believable then just oddly shaped rings. This edition of SC is a must have if you play to annihilate your opponent!<br /><br />Btw, the re-release in the &#34;HD&#34; marketing scheme, available on PSN, did not port well. Its an adulterated version as is no gauge by which to judge this great PS2 game.	2015-08-04

Sometimes if you have more than 1 after 15-30 mins the framerate can go to around 15 and stay there,  even after closing the program and re-opening.  Other than that,  I am playing on Max settings/resolution...  Nothing like it :)	2015-08-04

What a fun, different type of game.  I didn't know what to expect when a friend told me to get it so we could play together.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />In a nut shell the game is all about accepting different kinds of missions that have to do with some sort of heist.  For example, you rob banks, museums, jewelry stores, narcotics dealers etc. and then try and get away, all while your team of 4 is being bombarded by waves and waves of increasingly hard cops, SWAT, and gangsters.  Payday comes when your mission is complete.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the multiplayer aspect of this game.  Sure single player is fun and you can move at your own speed but the game was really built for playing online with friends and others looking for a good time.  When you begin, you are looking for any kind of job.  Your weapons and skills are pretty lame but you quickly level up so you can obtain better weapons and develop better skills to help you on harder, more rewarding jobs.<br /><br />Once you complete a job you gain experience and level up.  With each level up you get skill points.  With these skill points you have basically 4 &#34;tech&#34; trees that you can go down.  One helps you control and persuade people/cops, another tree develops your stealth skills, and another helps you break into things quicker.  Each tree has it's perks and the idea is that one of the guys in your group will take a different path than the other and specialize in certain skills and take on certain roles that you will come to depend on.  This is the heart of the game and such a great mechanic!  You can mix and match different skill trees but in order to get the best a certain tree has to offer, you really have to focus on it.  There are enough skills to master that even after 40-50 hours of playing with my friends, we haven't perfected any skill tree yet.  In comparison, we loved to play Borderlands 2 and enjoy the different paths in that game for characters as well but once we put in about 25-30 hours, we were done and ready for a new game.<br /><br />There are many ways to complete any single mission as well.  You can go in guns a' blazin or try and sneak in and get out without anyone noticing...the latter being extremely difficult if you don't have a couple guys with a lot of the stealth skills.  You can set the difficulty of each job and the rewards go up the more difficult it gets (and the faster you level up).<br /><br />You earn money at the end of jobs and with that you can purchase additional jobs, more weapons, and customize your own masks.  The only thing that frustrated me a little bit was that there is some DLC that you have to purchase if you want some of the extreme weapons like rocket launchers and even some normal weapons like grenades.  I still give it 5 stars because the game isn't meant for those type of weapons anyway but it would be fun once in a while and definitely useful on some missions.<br /><br />There are other things that you can customize based on the type of mission you chose.  The more armor that you put on and the bigger weapon you are holding means you will be slower and not so stealthy but you sure can take a few hits before going down.  This allows you to play the same mission many times over with different crew set-ups and individual load outs and have it be a completely different experience.<br /><br />Graphics are pretty good...good enough that it did not distract from the experience.  The A.I. is half-way decent.  You can control your teammates if they are computer players (always will have 4 on your team, A.I. or players).  The cops that run at you try to release hostages and definitely aren't the dumbest bad guys (good guys?) i've encountered in games.  While it does seem to progress slow and each level up comes further and further apart, there are plenty of weapons, equipment and skills to play around with.  I've never felt like I was waiting forever for something new to try out.<br /><br />In the end, if you havea couple of guys that you enjoy gaming with or even just like joining up with some random people online, this game is a great choice that has tons of options and replay-ability.ome random people online, this game is a great choice that has tons of options and replay-ability.	2015-08-04

Which to me was really good for a headset. Decided to get a pair that actually increased surroundings noise (footsteps, reloading, etc.) and not just make everything louder. And I especially liked the whole being able to hear myself talk thing. Emailed turtle beach and they referred me to this particular model saying it was the closest to the X11s. It's been great and installed very easily. Only bad thing I have to say is that it will randomly have a little glitch or something and the sound will cut out. Only for like half a second or so. Only happens when plugged into the computer though.	2015-08-04

I was getting tired of the standard rubber sticks getting greased up and having my thumbs slip off them.  It turns out these are a perfect fit for a PS4 controller, and the replacement process was far easier than I thought it would be (see the bottom of the review for a link to the tutorial I used.)  These sticks feel amazing, and are definitely worth the money if you're interested in getting metal stick replacements.  Now that I've experienced metal thumbsticks, I don't know if I'll ever be able to use a controller with normal ones ever again.  It's kind of like how once you go with a mechanical keyboard, you can't go back.<br /><br />I will say I was a bit skeptical to order these at first because I've been seeing a lot of bad reviews on Amazon with all kinds of different thumbsticks lately.  Despite that, I decided to order these anyway, and thankfully I was not disappointed.  I made sure to order them directly from E-mods rather than a different seller.  I think that's the reason people are having issues.  My guess is that they're simply clicking &#34;add to cart&#34; without seeing which seller was auto-chosen for them.  If you want to be safe and likely have no issues just like me, order from E-mods directly.<br /><br />Tutorial for putting these on a PS4 controller : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVTLCcl4hr0	2015-08-04

Sound quality is nice but it's an ordinary sound quality.  The ear muff extender broke pretty fast of more than careful usage.  It works perfectly fine, just doesn't lock on a certain extension meaning it'll slide down if you dangle it.  The jack that plugs into the adapter seems to have a tough time going in but it does, and the adapter I'm afraid will break soon.  The buttons are not sensitive at all, so you really have to press it hard.  The adapter also moves when you push the buttons, which implies possibility of breaking from force.  Now I take care of my things as perfect as I can to avoid any damages.  This just was like this within a few weeks.  So for this amount of money, you can do way better.  I know you're paying for the look and stuff, but it even looks cheap.  That's like slapping a $10 sticker on a small candy bar.  It's an ordinary piece of equipment with huge price tag.  The picture didn't look cheap but the equipment when I got it showed otherwise.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE turtle beaches, but this is a sad excuse for their headphones.  Very cheaply made (literally probably cost a few dollars), ordinary sound quality, the accessories are hard to use, wear and tear seems to be harsher on this and overall just plain... Average.  Maybe below.  So again, you can do better.	2015-08-04

The gaming systems seems to be Sony's only exception for the rule to be VERY stingy when selling their products with all the necessary accessories; Bought an Xperia Z2 and came with the worst charging cable so people would be so frustrated that they'd fork out to buy the proper charger which the Z2 supports. The headphones don't come with a very particular USB cable (necessary to charge the headphones) which many folks don't have, neither did it come with ... Seriously, they couldn't chuck in a USB cable?<br /><br /> Then the problems started happening; first the battery stopped charging, I was disappointed but not furious, since I could pick up another battery  online and I'd be good to go. After replacing the battery, the headset worked but it still wouldn't charge (giving it a lifespan of a few hours). I decided<br /> to try 2 more USB cables, including my Wii U USB cable still no charge. After doing some research, it seems like it's a product defect and there's nothing I can do. Sony's response is &#34;too bad&#34;. Aside from the consoles, I'm staying away from everything Sony.	2015-08-04
US	51804388	R1VW557S35QKM2	B00WTI3JPE	82806212	The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt	Video Games	3	0	2	N	N	Too long and too repetitive	Unlike many reviewers of this game, I have actually FINISHED it.... after almost 200 hours.  It was, in summary, a passable and well done game, but it suffers from pacing and is simply too long - especially since much of the gameplay is repetitive, as well as the settings.<br /><br />I will, unlike others, start with the Cons:<br /><br />-The movement/camera is a bit slow. Often the camera would look off-centre or down, requiring manual adjustment.<br />-Pacing.  The last ten hours of the game are the &#34;climax&#34;.  And unlike Dragon Age Inquisition, W3 does not end with one final battle.... it is a series of them.  But in a 200 hour or so game, why pack the big fights into the last 1%?<br />-Controls. Sometimes the character didn't go where I wanted. He would stand too close to an object for me to pick it up. Or I couldn't easily steer him into a doorway.<br />-Dumb horse. He often appeared in odd locations; too far or stuck behind a fence or something. And he isn't very good at jumping.<br />-Setting. The graphics are really well done... maybe at the cost of variety?  The landscape and cityscapes have really little variety, compared to DAI for example.<br />-Spells and combat.  The Witcher really only has two useful spells during combat... for the entire game! They upgrade a bit... but compared to DAI, two spells is just not much. Most of the combat is swordplay, but while the level of the sword goes up the combat does not really change much.  Often, there would be a short cinematic kill scene like mortal combat. These were neat and only took 2 seconds.<br />-Longest dialogue scenes. These were great in the beginning, but by hour 100 I was just scrolling through them as fast as possible. It seems as if more than 50% of the game could be cut scenes and dialogue - which can turn a 200 hr game into 400 hours!<br /><br />Pros<br />-Grenades. They are simply fun.<br />-Graphics. It didn't look like an upscaled 720p. It was native 1080p, with vibrant colors, good interaction, varying weather/day-night, etc.<br />-Open worldness.  You can pretty much go here and there on horseback or foot.  Inside buildings, in caves, etc.  There are only 4 or so &#34;maps&#34; - and really only two that you will actually do a lot in.  And these are huge.<br />-Swimming/diving. This was not a huge part, but it was a bit different and necessary.<br /><br />Other<br />-Storyline. It was ok. But it wasn't until hour 150 that I figured the whole purpose of the game... and at that not so much, as I was rushing through the dialogue.  Most of the game is Geralt looking for his friend/foster daughter.  It isn't clear why it matters much.  A lot of the game, actually, is finding people.<br />-Sex scenes.  Nice PG-13 scenes gave the game a fresh feel and made it feel a bit more adult.<br />-There is only one character that you play, except when you do a few things with &#34;Ciri&#34;. But these are just intermissions, as you cannot upgrade her kit or skills. One character is easier to manage than 15 (as in DAI) - but it is also much less variety in  combat.<br /><br />I feel like this game would have been quite acceptable at 100 hours or so, but 200 was simply too much.  They should have made the end more like the middle... and maybe have added another character or two that you could control.  In the last battles there are other characters.  Even if you don't control them in any way, they add variety to the slash and shield combo.<br /><br />www.liamhdooley.comteraction, varying weather/day-night, etc.<br />-Open worldness.

Not only did one of the controllers that comes with it die within a few weeks of receiving it, but I'm convinced the unit itself is responsible for ruining NES controllers.

You would pay the same price for an Xbox One with only the basic cables and (wireless) controller from any major retailer, and this version includes 2 full games. My only reasons for giving this review 3 instead of 5 stars is simply Microsoft's Windows 8, and the hard drive space. I use both a Playstation 4 and an Xbox One, and the PS4 is much easier to navigate. Microsoft has tried to make dashboard navigation easier with Windows 8, but in reality it is much worse than even Xbox 360. The 500 GB hard seems like a lot of space, but in reality it is not when you have to install data for every game you play, sometimes upwards of 100 GB. The system is very fast with a great selection of games.	2015-08-04
US	50508229	R320YMGOM3F0NI	B000035XF0	542306912	WCW Main Event	Video Games	4	0	0	N	Y	WCW Main Event	I recently bought this game (used), and I have the honor of giving it its first review (as I also did with WCW SuperBrawl for SNES)! I think that for a GB game, it's actually quite good. As you would probably expect, it's pretty limited (or it seems that way to me), but it's still fun. I've mostly gotten beaten when I've played it, but I've had a good time doing it! I usually enjoy fighting and wrestling games more when I play against another player, but I can't do that with this game because I don't have a Game Link or know anyone else who has a GB or this game! That kind of stinks, but oh well! The game actually has a great roster, in terms of both size and names. Although nine guys wouldn't constitute a very sizable roster on most other games, it's a good-sized one for a GB game, at least in my opinion. In addition to the game's &#34;cover boy,&#34; the Stinger (in &#34;surfer&#34; form),  the roster includes the Steiner Brothers (featuring a pre-&#34;Big Poppa Pump&#34; Scott Steiner), Ravishing Rick Rude, Johnny B. Badd,  Dustin Rhodes (from before he became that weirdo Goldust), Big Van Vader, Ron Simmons (aka Faarooq), and a Steve Austin from before he was &#34;Stone Cold&#34;! (As far as I know, this was the only game, at least for a Nintendo system, to include Stunning Steve!) In fact, the roster here is very much the same as that of WCW SuperBrawl for SNES; the only guy here who isn't on that game is Steve Austin. (SuperBrawl also featured a few guys who aren't here, including &#34;Nature Boy&#34; Ric Flair.) Both games were by FCI, who apparently had the rights to do WCW games at the time, so I guess that's at least one reason for the very similar rosters; also, the two games were apparently released not too far apart from each other, which is probably another reason. I don't know all about the play modes, since I can't play with another player (and also since my copy of the game didn't come with instructions), but a single player can play &#34;exhibition&#34; matches or a tournament. The matches work in &#34;rounds&#34; for a set time limit. Somewhat strangely, it seems that you can change the number of rounds (or &#34;falls,&#34; as the game calls them) or the time limit, but not both at once. I don't get that, but whatever. As far as moves, there doesn't seem (based on what I've seen)to be many of them, but in an 8-Bit game for a system that doesn't have a lot of buttons to utilize, I guess that's to be expected. As far as I can tell, the guys seem to have mostly the same moves (not an unusual kind of thing in early wrestling games), although I've read that they each have a signature move that you perform with the Select button. I don't think I've pulled off any so far, though; I don't really know what the conditions have to be in order to be able to use them. I think the graphics are very good for a GB game. Despite being small, 8-Bit characters, the guys do kind of resemble their real-life counterparts (most of them do, anyway). There seem to be just a few generic outfits that they wear, but they look O.K. I guess there wasn't too much they could do with wrestler graphics that small, anyway. The other graphics are quite adequate, too. (Something that is sort of funny is that when you lose a match, you get carried out of the ring on a stretcher!) You can even get color on GBC! Overall, I like this game, even though I haven't completely figured it out. I recommend it if you want a GB wrestling game, like WCW, and were into wrestling before it was SUCH a steaming heap of you-know-what! (A word of warning, though: The game seems to go for some rather steep prices, even used!)	2015-08-04

I'm on a Mac 10	Even if you can get it working, it's a bad controller. I'm on a Mac 10.10.4. The drivers do not install automatically. I spent a couple of hours trying to find the download with no luck. Eventually I downloaded something called USB Overdrive, an annoying program that bugs you to buy it every time you restart your computer. The program makes it so you can assign keyboard buttons to the controller. This isn't how a joystick is supposed to work, but it is the only way I could get it to work. It's not worth the trouble, spend the extra money and get something better.<br /><br />Now for the controller. You have to push the buttons hard, very hard. I haven't even used it that much and my thumbs are killing me. I tried turning the sensitivity up on the USB Overdrive program and the controller went crazy. It's hard to describe, but let's say you pushed the Y button once. The computer would keep acting like you were still pressing the button for minutes.<br /><br />Like I said guys, it's not worth it.	2015-08-04

Examples such as Molotov cocktail bottles, the bottle trajectory, the ability for a side character to &#34;see&#34; the monsters by squatting down.... if that's not a rip-off, I don't know what is.  How about the metal helmets on the monsters?  Straight out of Silent Hill.  I love the beautiful graphics and what can be occasionally challenging game play due to shortage of ammunitions.

All opinions remain my own and were not influenced. My opinions may not reflect those of others or of the company.<br /><br />I am highly impressed by this PS4 controller charger. It offers a sleek modern design that is sure to match and decor and make the room pop. I love that it's functional and ideal for game parties. It can charge up to 4 controllers at a time. 2 controllers charge from the base by sliding into place and the other 2 can charge by usb on the side.<br /><br />The lights lit up as soon as I plugged them in and they were charging without any issue. They charge pretty fast, giving us more play time and less down time! I love that the charging station has a non-slip base. You don't have to worry about it sliding all over the place while you are trying to plug a controller in. Plus, it's steady and durable. You don't have to worry about it tipping over when in use. The controllers are secure when placed in the chargining station and  won't fall out.<br /><br />The charger base comes with a USB charger and an outlet adapter so that you can plug the charger into the wall. The charger cord could be a little longer, but luckily I set it right next to my tv and it's the perfect length. However, it may be too short if you chose to place it somewhere else.<br /><br />I've been using this charger for about a week now and I love it! It's much better than our old charger and it charges faster as well. I'll definitely continue to use it!<br /><br />Pros<br />Modern Sleek Design<br />Charges up to 4 controllers at the same time<br />Not bulky<br />lights let you know when the controller is fully charged or still charging<br />affordable<br />can power thru the adapter as well as the PS4 itself<br />non slip base<br />Easy to use<br /><br />Cons<br />The provided cord may be a little short for some.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better charging system.

I especially like the dance portions, but have yet to unlock any more than just a few basic moves. I am starting to wonder if that's all there will be, in which case, Nintendo is missing the boat by not creating a dance program for Wii that takes people further than that. Same is true of the really fun Climbing portion -- once you have mastered climbing to the top, there does not seem to be any more challenging climbing to try. In many cases, the only thing that gets unlocked is more time at the activity, rather than a more complicated, difficult, or interesting activity. I am enjoying this game and its variety, but, like I said, it would be nice if Nintendo would make more challenging versions of many of the activities presented.	2015-08-04

A steel case for the game.  A comic. And a downloadable story line featuring Harley Quinn.<br />The game itself is great.  You get to be the batman to the fullest extent.  The Batman mobile is amazing when you're not driving it.  What I mean is that the controls are horrible.  But in Battle Mode it become truly stunning and creates some of the best game play I have ever experienced.<br />Another flaw in the game is the sporadic freezes.  The game will randomly freeze and become inoperable.  A particular building (I forget which one) will allow you to fall through eternity over and over again even through a reloading of the last save.  There are other glitches here and there that make the game annoying to play at times.<br />Over all the story is a rehashed one but the game play is distracting enough that you don't care.  I  would still recommend it specially if you are a die hard Batman fan.	2015-08-04

I had totally forgotten about it until I saw it while looking for some new games to get. Well, I have pretty much nothing positive to say, much like many of the reviewers here.<br /><br />It sucks. It really, really sucks. The first thing I noticed was the horrible controls. I don't even remember what they were, but I remember wuite clearly that they felt unnatural and the game didn't respond well to them anyway. I remember that I had no clue what to do. I know that the game is all about exploration and such, but you have to give me some sort of idea about what to do.  Even playing something like Fallout New Vegas, I know what I'm supposed to be doing, even if I get horribly lost on the massive map. Here, they just kind of toss random stuff at you and expect you to know what to do. Pretty annoying.<br /><br />I personally rarely use the 3d on the 3DS. Sometimes, I'll turn it on while playing just to see how something looks, but it gets pretty impractical during real play. However, it's still a nice feature to have. This game doesn't even have 3d. Period. There is no 3d in any place in the game as far as I know. Why make it a 3ds title? Why not make it a Virtual Console title or something to that effect? It makes no sense! Do not waste your time and money on this game. Please.	2015-08-04

There is much more do to then just helping to pick of clothes for your costumers. You can now work part-time at both hair salon and makeup salon. Design miniature homes to let your costumers rent out. Become a poster/fashion model and so much more. I will need to point out that this is an Japanese Game. In order to play it you will need an Japanese 3DS and know how to read basic Japanese. As long as you can read Hiragana and Katakana. You can simply look up what the is highlight to understand what a costumers would like.	2015-08-04

I bought this gun accessorie to replace my nyco sure shot gun because it did not allow me to press the A button without using other hand(in games like dead space and RE DS Chronicles the A button required). The weight of the accessorie is nice. The whole body is made with the rubberized plastic not just the grips like I thought (this is good). The duel triggers work well only slight wiggle room for triggers. I could not figure out what the batteries where for...then I just gave it a shot. Bamn! Built in Vibrations! Both B and A triggers have this feature. Press for a single jolt hold for &#34;rapid fire&#34;. I have got to say I love it the extra jolt goes a long way when combined with the wiimote's built in vibrations. Look these guns will break eventually they have moving parts they all will but this is a solid build and looks like it will last as long as my others. Get it it is 15 bucks.	2015-08-04

Metal Gear Solid is one of my favorite game series. I was so excited to get all the games (except the latest one) in one collection. The only games that it doesn't include is the two Portable Ops and the two Acid games. However, it includes all the games in the main series. Portable Ops does have a part in the main story line, but it is not necessary for understanding the whole picture. This collection includes Metal Gear Solid, and Metal Gear Solid VR Missions for download on the PlayStation store. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker on one disc. This disc is the HD collection, and everything is crystal clear when playing.  On the other disc it includes Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. Snake Eater includes Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake on its menu. Even if you do not play these, on the menu of Metal Gear Solid 1 is an extras tab, including the plot of Metal Gear 1 and 2. I personally was not a big fan of these two, but they are still a crucial part to the history in the Metal Gear world. Metal Gear Solid and VR missions were in third person like all the other games, but they are more in an orbital camera view, so instead of being behind snake, the camera is above him.<br />This will continue to be one of my favorite video games. The story line of Metal Gear Solid is full of action, emotion, and it reveals many secrets throughout the series. For a $30 game you get 8 games in one set.<br /><br />Update: In Metal Gear Solid 1, Campbell asks you to contact Meryl, and he says her codec code is on the back of the CD case. I searched frantically on the game for a CD, until looking it up on the internet. He means the games case, but because this is a download, you do not have the case. Her frequency is 140.15	2015-08-04

Originally I purchased the Niko 2 pack with charge base and it did pretty well but you cannot buy extra packs for it without buying the whole set and base. I needed a battery for my 3rd controller so I picked this up. I am very pleased and though I expected the USB charge to be a pain it is not because it will charge off any decent USB charger. This means I can use the Amazon Basics (2.4amp) charger I ordered for my cell phone to charge it. Lastly the life of this is about 3 times longer than the NiMh ones that come with the Niko and the battery reporting is more accurate. Ultimately I am not displeased with the Niko but knowing what I know now I would have paid the extra and picked up all MS kits.	2015-08-04

This is much better than PES, or any other football/soccer game for they have all the official stadiums, kits, logos, and they have more enjoyable game modes. My favorite game mode is Ultimate Team, for the creativity and the freedom you have to create any team you want, trading up to get more expensive teams, testing your teams against others, and going up and down through the seasons. I also enjoy online seasons mode and career mode. One annoying thing I find with this game, is that the servers crash quite often. It can get very frustrating when you're about to win promotion, and then the servers drop, and it counts the game as a loss, but other than that I love this game!	2015-08-04

The contact points for the paddle shifters are a thin metal strip that tends to bend with use and eventually snap in two. This makes the shifter unusable but everything else works great. Fortunately my racing game allows me to play in automatic shifting mode. The second breakable part is the bungee type spring that provides resistance to the turning of the steering wheel. It wears out and breaks in two. The steering still works but without the feeling of centering control. This is my fourth wheel I have purchased because of this problem. I haven't found any other stand alone unit in this price range that compares. I mentioned these problems to Tech over a year ago but I don't think they took it seriously. Also it would be helpful if the seller would mention that the wheel is a rebuild as Thrustmaster will not cover it under warranty if it is. I learned that the hard way as well.	2015-08-04

I realize I'm reviewing an 8 year old game, but geez, you would think for a game made by EA and The Simpsons, there would be some sort of quality put into the game.  This game severely suffers from horrible camera angles.  You really need to be able to look around in this game, and it's often not possible.  Things get in the way, and when they do, the camera snaps back into place, making me wonder where I am sometimes.  The camera angles also inhibit shooting things, etc.  Jumping and climbing can also be difficult, and I often found myself falling off things because I wasn't able to see where I was going.  When Bart is flying or Homer is a ball, it's difficult to look down and tell where you are.  You just have to guess.  Also, sometimes you might want to jump in a direction and can't see because the camera won't let you spin the camera around, so you have to do it blindly.  All-in-all, a very egregious error for a game in the modern era, especially when made by such a large developer with a big budget.<br /><br />Another strange thing is the artwork.  It says &#34;In HD&#34; and some of the cutscenes look really nice, but then there are other scenes that look like they were hand drawn by someone on a drawing pad who had an unsteady hand.<br /><br />The gameplay itself is pretty horrendous (for the camera angle problem mentioned earlier) but it also suffers from a lack of cohesiveness.  It's just not really fun to play for the most part, and has a lackluster quality and strange disparate parts.  The only redeeming quality to the gameplay is that they reference several classic games, and the references are enjoyable, but the gameplay is hit or miss.  They seem to be embracing the ironic, but it doesn't always come across as enjoyable.<br /><br />The Simpsons references are weak.  All the voice actors seemed to participate in the project, but the jokes seem dull and misplaced.  I would venture to say that no actual writers on the show wrote any of the dialogue, but instead some sort of &#34;B-team&#34; of writers worked on it, who had an appreciation for The Simpsons humor, but didn't know how to actually create something funny.  The jokes and references to former shows fell flat often.  The first achievement made me laugh, but the rest went downhill from there.  I almost wonder if someone from EA wrote the script for the show because there are a lot of inside jokes about EA that were just silly.<br /><br />I liked exploring the town, but it's pretty limited.<br /><br />This game seemed like someone tried to make a good game, but it suffers mainly from bad camera angles, which make the game almost unplayable at times.  If it were any other game, I would give it only one star, but because I'm a huge Simpsons fan I gave it another star.  It's not worth the used price I paid for it, and looking at some of the outrageous prices it's being sold for by some vendors (More than when it originally came out.  I'm assuming for collectors) I really don't think it's worth that price at all.  Rent this one for two days if you can or avoid it altogether.e show wrote any of the dialogue, but instead some sort of &#34;B-team&#34; of writers worked on it, who had an appreciation for The Simpsons humor, but didn't know how to actually create something funny.

My husband and I are avid gamers and have played multiple MMORPGs for the past 10 years.  We both played the beta, took a break, and then both bought copies of the product as a PC download.  Downloaded the product with no problems, played for one day with relatively few/no glitches and then when we went to log on a second day, both of our accounts were suspended and then banned permanently.  Our characters were low levels (below 10) and we had done NOTHING to violate the Terms of Service.  After multiple attempts at trying to un-ban our accounts the ESO-Customer Service representative refused to tell us what had happened to prompt the ban and refused to answer further questions.  So now I'm stuck with a game that I can't play.  I should have spent my money somewhere else.  I would never recommend this product to anyone based on the customer service I received and advise all to stay away or waste your money.	2015-08-04

Works perfectly!	This PlayStation 3 Dualshock controller worked amazingly well when I was judging its performance.  First off, the appearance and cosmetic aspect  of the controller is identical to that of the normal PS3 controller, which usually comes bundled with the console.  The only notable difference is the replacement of the Sony button with the off-brand PS3 button.  The controller itself handles extremely well when compared to a standard controller, possibly even better in fact.  The buttons are quick and responsive, joysticks are easy and maneuverable, and the left and right trigger/buttons have smooth glides in and out, satisfying trigger-happy gamers.  The controller is a cheap and great alternative to the normal PS3 controller, and in my opinion performs better, which only adds to its list of great features.  Dualshock vibration works fantastically on this gamepad, the rumbling is suited to each game and is perfectly timed.  The controller displays no sign of lag whatsoever and is easily synced with the console.  I had absolutely no problems with this controller so far, and I feel that I don't plan to in the future.  This is a great controller for all Sony PlayStation users that need a high quality gamepad for all their gaming needs.	2015-08-04

I remember getting addicted to pinball party a couple days later when me and my family stayed over at a family friends place during the New Years and throughout the dead timeslot hours from midnight to 4, I couldn't stop playing this game. The Sonic tables are fun yet difficult, Casinopolis is fun to spend a lot of time in mostly for the Roulette and Bingo tables (the Slots one is kinda hard to win plus you lose a lot of rings!). But most of all, I LOVE the Nights table the most. Not only because of its music but the Nights tables are fun! You have to get the ball in the Idya palace three times to unlock the idya and once you use your left flipper to perfectly grab the idya just repeat four times and you get to fight the Nightmares! In fact I've gotten so far in the Nights arcade table that I've reached past 2,000,000,000 points and was surprised to find a hidden stage known as &#34;Twin Seeds&#34; the growth! There you get to fight Wizeman in a dark table where ypu can't even see the lit up arrows! I can spend many hours playing the Nights tables and rehearing its awesome soundtrack again and again. My favorites are &#34;Spring Valley&#34; and &#34;Soft museum.&#34;<br /><br />Now I wouldn't say pinball party is perfect but Story mode can be something to complain about. Challenges there can go from being dead easy to near impossible. I'm referring to the final fight with Eggman. It's almost impossible. You need to beat him as his score keeps increasing!! Worst of all he starts with 200,000 points ans his score only doubles by the second making this challenge all the more frustrating. I'm alright though I beat him twice but was disappointed to not unlock anything new -_- A tip to you players the only way to beat Eggman is to complete Casino Paradise before the time runs out and believe me the odds are against you. Sometimes the ball doesn't go to where you want it to land. Spelling the word E G G can be tricky because you have to hit the flipper at just the right time to get the ball upper atmosphere. Then defeating Eggman for me ia difficult cuz getting the ball in that one hole takes a lot of patience! In fact I got the ball into the &#34;other&#34; hole much easier!! Don't waste your time on this challenge too. When you defeat Eggman you have to sit through one minute of the FRUSTRATING BONUS ROUND WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SKIP IT!! I HATE THE USELESS BONUS ROUND ESPECIALLY FOR A MISSION LIKE THIS CUZ THE CLOCK IS STILL AGAINST YOU AND EGGMAN'S POINTS CONTINUE TO RISE BY 200,000! I HATE THIS THE MOST! That's why you need to finish Casino Paradise the third stage in order to win. There's no other way.<br /><br />Well if the game was too easy it wouldn't be any fun so its good they made that impossibly hard stage. I was hoping for a Black Jack table in Casinopolis cuz I'm still mad you don't get anything for defeating Eggman (or Metal Sonic!)<br /><br />The Samba de Amigo table is one that I don't really care for but it's alright. There's also a Tiny Chao Garden that's always fun!<br /><br />To conclude, its been 10 years since I owned this game and now that I'm deployed in Qatar, I still find myself bringing this game with me and my still working GBA SP! I got this game for Sonic Advance but Sonic Pinball Party tops all the hand held games out there since I'm still playing it even to this day! A great, fun, addictive game hands down.radise before the time runs out and believe me the odds are against you. Sometimes the ball doesn't go to where you want it to land.

I've been playing it ever since. I've had many great memories while playing Guild Wars 2, and I love that there is no monthly fee. So if I take a break from playing, I can just go back to playing without having to pay. This is an MMO that is very different to other MMOs. I don't know this from personal experience, but I've watch gameplay of other MMOs and Guild Wars 2 is very unique. Along with your main storyline, there are side missions, exploration of a HUGE world (which took me an extremely long time to discover the entire map), there are dungeons, &#34;World Events&#34; usually during the holidays which are actually really fun, and SO much more you can do. The game has really changed from the time I purchased Guild Wars 2 and now. 90% of the time, good updates! There are times such as grinding where you have to be playing a lot to get good gear, but what MMO isn't like this? Playing with a group of friends is also a ton of fun.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Very unique in comparison to other MMOs out right now<br />- FREE TO PLAY/NO MONTHLY FEE<br />- Because there is no monthly fee, you may think &#34;I'll have to use real money to get good gear&#34;. Absolutely not. You can earn tons of in-game currency in all sorts of way, without having to use real money. Obviously it wouldn't be as fast as using real money, but there are definitely ways to get rich without paying an extra cent.<br />- There are dynamic events that pop up throughout the map and its always fun to join other players doing these events.<br />- There's PvP (player vs player), PvE (Player vs Environment, no PvP), and WvW (world vs world/server vs server). There are different modes for everyone to play.<br />- Every player has different and unique gear. I rarely see two players who look alike, gear-wise. I love seeing all the unique armor and dye combinations that players have.<br />- You can create five characters for free, and if you want more, you can purchase another character slot.<br />- There are eight (soon to be nine) professions or classes, and five different races.<br />- If your character is level 80, but your friend is level 10, you two can still play together and not have your level 80 be extremely overpowered. There is a level-scaling system which works very well.<br />- One of the greatest thing, close to being my favorite, is the Guild Wars 2 community. 95% of the people are very friendly and will help anyone with questions or they will have casual conversations with random people. I have also encountered a lot of people who give away valuable in-game items to people. There is also a great diversity of people who play. From young to older. Personally, I am on the younger side (18), but some people in my guild are married and I have met older folks who even play Guild Wars 2 with their children. I think its great.<br /><br />There is so much more that I love about this game, but way too many things to list.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- It isn't like Skyrim where you can hit whenever. There are a certain set of moves that certain weapons have, but I don't mind.<br />I can't really think of much I dislike. I'm not trying to say there are not things I dislike in Guild Wars 2, but there are definitely more things I like about it than things I dislike about the game.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great, fun, and unique MMO. One of the greatest video games I have ever played. Definitely worth the money. Also to note, there is an expansion pack (Heart of Thorns) coming out soon, which is different from the regular updates they release. This expansion is $50 which also includes the core game if you do not already have it. Personally, I will not be pre-purchasing the expansion pack due to the price, but I wouldn't doubt if I bought it. I am just waiting to see what others say about the expansion. But even without the expansion, there are world event updatesas I stated earlier, that are extremely fun. For example, there was an event during Christmas, and there were SO many things you could do. New game modes, new gear and loot. GREAT PURCHASE and its only $20! So what are you waiting for?? There is never a time where I've had nothing to do while playing.	2015-08-04

Four controllers and they all had the rubber wore out after minimal use. Also two of them are unplayable do to the left analog stick sticking. For example playing a shooting game my character will be moving in a direction and just stop in his tracks. Luckily the other two contollwrs have not done that yet. Oh and sony says i need a receipt to get them fixed.

These include Blackjack, Baccarat, Craps, Roulette, Poker, Slots, and Video Poker. Picking each game is quick and the load screen is pretty fast. When you pick Blackjack there is an initial choice of 1, 2, or 4 card decks. The game plays fast and the controls are intuitive but the initial part of placing a bet and choosing an amount is slightly clunky.<br /><br />With Poker you've got a choice between 7 Card Stud, 5 Card Stud, 5 Card Draw, Jacks or Better, and Texas Hold 'Em. You can place a bet between $3 to $200. The game moves along quickly and controls are easy to understand. For Slots you have a choice between Ancient Treasure, Buffet, Love 2 Win, Easy Money, and Beyond the Stars. There is a choice among $1, $5, or $10 machines. Certain Slots have 3 reels and others have 4. Also some only win on one line while others use all three.<br /><br />And Video Poker has Double Down, Jacks or Better, Jokers Wild, 10s or Better, & Deuces Wild among the choices. Bets are $1, $5, or $10. Lastly you've got Baccarat and Roulette among the table games. Both games are also intuitive to control and plays at a fast pace. The included instruction manual gives an in-depth and thorough explanation of the rules and strategies for each table game or machine. The graphics are mostly sprite-based except for the roulette wheel, which is comprised of polygons.<br /><br />And the sounds are typical of casino ambiance with the spinning slots, token noises, and chatter from gamblers. You can turn off the background noise(or lower it) if it bothers you. And when you exit a game you have a choice of saving the progress if you choose. Overall this is a solid gambling/casino game for the PS1 with plenty of gaming choices and a fast-paced style of play with easy to learn controls(for the most part).	2015-08-04

This piece of hardware can be VERY frustrating!<br /><br />I had to fight to get the drivers installed and perform a few workarounds to make it work as intended. Once everything was installed, it worked fine UNTIL you reboot or unplug the device, then you have to go through the process again of installing the drivers manually.<br /><br />Pros:<br />You get to use an XBOX 360 controller on your PC<br /><br />Cons:<br />You might get a headache from trying to install the drivers over and over again trying to make this thing work properly<br />Connection seems intermittent on occasion, even when the receiver is right next to the adapter.(this was tested with more than one controller)<br /><br />Microsoft has discontinued support for this device completely and the drivers are no longer supported either, so the problem isn't necessarily the manufacturer of this product entirely, but overall I would just recommend staying away from using an XBOX 360 controller on your PC in any way.	2015-08-04

Mainly, any time you do something in the game, say go to a dungeon, or perform alchemy, time passes. You are usually given a certain amount of time to complete missions. It turns these games into a kind of time management game as well as an RPG, similar to how Persona 3 and 4 work in some ways.<br /><br />Normally, I hate time constraints. It's one of the reasons I just can't play Dead Rising games. I want to do everything and have a hard time doing that without a guide. Many of the Atelier games are like that. You'll find doing everything without a guide very difficult. Escha and Logy is not like that. Not only are the assignments fairly simple to complete within the time constraints they give you, things like chatting to your team mates and towns people doesn't take up time either. To finish it off, you get a whole year of time for the last assignment and in that time you can finish up any prior assignments you didn't have time for, making it very easy to see every ending and every scene in the game. So if you are worried about that aspect of this series, this would be a decent entry point, or perhaps as a second game to play in the series as I have heard the next game in the series does away with the time stuff completely.<br /><br />Now, to the second aspect of the series that makes it special. These games focus heavily on alchemy, think crafting in most other games. You gather items and get recipes for everything from armor to healing items. In this game you need to make everything. It's been a while, but iirc in previous Ateliers you could buy healing/attack itemsshould you need them. This one is different. All attack items, all defense items, all healing items, everything must be made by you. This ends up being one of the most time consuming and fun parts of the game. Finding just the right recipe to blow every enemy off the map with one toss of a crafted bomb is a delight. It also means you can choose to play the game using primarily crafted items and not worrying about armor and weapons for your party. It is completely possible to focus only on healing items and bombs and minimal time upgrading your equipment and still finish the game with no issue. Even hard bosses can be taken out with the right super crafted items.<br /><br />That brings me to the battle system. The battle system is still traditional turn based, nice in the days when the trend is everything moving to action rpgs. Atelier Escha & Logy has massaged this system into something dynamic and classic all at once. You have six members at the ready, 3 on the front line 3 on the back line. When the support gauge is ready, even those in the back line can participate with both supporting attacks and defense. There are skills that can be used, special support attacks that get unlocked and even super specials. The fighting in this game is so varied it took me quite a while playing before I had seen all the special move animations.<br /><br />As for the overall look and feel of the game, It's very nicely animated. The game has that jrpg quirky dialog, and the characters can be a little stereotypical at times. It's not the greatest writing, but it's cute enough. I listen to the English voice overs. One of the reason's I first got into these games is the first one I played, Atelier Iris, had the most charming voice acting in a game I'd played in a while. The voice acting in this game isn't the best, but it's certainly not the worst I've played. Some characters are much better than others.<br /><br />I would recommend this game to any jrpg fan, even those afraid of thetime issue. It may seem like you are running out of time, but remember, you get a whole year at the end to finish things up.	2015-08-04

I purchased this Wireless Ultra Sensor Bar back when the original Wii first came out.  The sensor bar that came with the Wii was not going to work for me because I have kitties who like to chew cords and immediately chewed my sensor bar wire in half.  When I saw this sensor bar I immediately bought it.  It takes four AA batteries and you can set it anywhere from a standard range to a wide range.  There is a power button and a button for setting a timer of either one or two hours.  There is also an indicator to let you know if the batteries are getting low and need to be changed.  I have been using this sensor bar for about nine years, with both the Wii and now the Wii U.  I find that it works great and am very glad to have it.  I use it on the standard range setting because I play only about 7-8 feet away from the sensor bar.  Love it.	2015-08-04

But lacking support?	It's a great, solid product. It's bare bones and there doesn't seem to be any software associated with it so you can't really designate buttons to specific things without some sort of third party support, but those are easy enough to find. It's comfortable, responsive, and neat looking. I would've given it 5 stars save for the fact I can't find any support for the thing online. It comes with instructions in the box but I expected there to also be online support through their website or something but I can't find any official support for this product. It has a real black market sorta feel to it, if you know what I mean. I feel like if I do have an issue with the product I won't be able to get assistance. I haven't had any issues with it, though, cause it's so awesome I guess, so that point is sorta moot. So the product itself is totally 5 stars material, but the support and information on the product and company leaves me uneasy and really lacking so that's 4 stars for me. I'd recommend it as is.	2015-08-04

Otherwise the space feels (is) disconnected.<br />Material gathering<br />One area seemed like it was missing a lot quests and stuff to do.  That area also introduced the Avaar.  A $15 DLC will fill out the details of the Avaar.<br /><br />Overall while DAI has significant improvements, the story, the characters, and the choices are lackluster.  For me, the spark is now gone ‚Äì beaten away and gone.  I don‚Äôt expect I‚Äôll be playing future editions to the Dragon Age franchise.  At this point, I also doubt whether I‚Äôll be playing future Bioware games.<br /><br />I loved the graphics and particularly fighting large monsters like dragons.  The combat was great, much better than previous games.  There was a lot to explore.  I don‚Äôt think I completed a single zone.<br /><br />I spent over 100 hours playing DAI, but I don‚Äôt feel it was time well spent.  I had fun but was also kind of bored.  DAI is a lot of game for the price.  But I didn‚Äôt have as much fun or get as much out of it as I did with Dragon Age Origins.  I finished with no desire to replay it.<br /><br />None of the choices seem fraught with moral consequence or significance.  I didn‚Äôt need to agonize over choices and none of them have stayed with me.  In writing this a few months after beating, I don‚Äôt even recall much of the plot or anything significant about the NPC characters.<br /><br />None of the choices felt impactful.  Some things changed but generally not widespread significance.  None of the choices made me wantto replay to see what might have been.<br /><br />I didn‚Äôt like the crafting or the material gathering.  Materials are rare and a variety is needed.  Stopping to gather materials felt like it was significant chunk of my time.  Whether or not it was, it felt like too much.  Some materials are too rare and take too long to get.  I don‚Äôt like farming, that‚Äôs one reason I quit MMO.  At one point I thought about quitting the game about 3/4 in, but then I looked up a material duplication exploit.  I don‚Äôt usually use cheats, but for me it was that or quit before finishing.	2015-08-04

Being able to plug in your phone or iPod, for instance, to add your own soundtracks to games is pretty cool. Sound quality is decent, although at times bass/explosions push the speakers beyond their limits.<br /><br />The big issue was reliability. Within 6 months I was having issues with the 3.5 connectors from the headphones into the auxiliary control unit the headphones are equipped with. If the 3.5 wasn't just right the left headphone would go dead and/or static-y.<br /><br />TL;DR Performance was OK, but they broke after 4 months.	2015-08-04

My only disappointment is that they didn't expand the final dungeon and boss somewhat, something that always felt like it was hastily tossed together.

If you're planning on just watching Netflix or any other streaming service, turn it off/remove it. When I first purchased it, it made a slight whirring sound, naturally, due to the spinning of the fans. But after a few weeks of use, it's started to make a horrendous buzzing sound, to the point where I would have to smack the unit for it to stop.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't purchase it. The PS3 system itself is designed with ventilation in mind. It really doesn't need anything more added to assist with this. The only way I can see someone needing extra cooling like this is if they were to hold some sort of day-long tournament where the system would be under heavy use for 10+ hours, and that's not how most people play.<br /><br />Don't bother.

If you're coming into this game or series for the first time long after release, just buy it, it's a no brainer! Very high quality visuals, excellent dialogue and story, and brilliant combat situations.<br /><br />Just finished the campaign which is all I ever play with this genre of game, as I don't do multiplayer any more. 10-15 years ago, I was all about MP, but not these days where game time is limited, where the loudest thing in my house is not Counter-Strike pumped through my PC speakers but kids running around playing. I understand this game got a bad rap early on for failed multiplayer delivery. I couldn't care less. It's a solid 5-star interactive novel with fun, exciting missions and a satisfying ending that leads directly into the sequel. So, you &#34;win&#34; but there's more to come with these characters. I played through on casual mode. That's how I play shooters, to decide if I really like the game, whether it's buggy or not, then consider playing again at normal mode. I'm not hardcore anymore, over the hill as a gamer (but, for the record, my reflexes still beat my 16-year old son's!).<br /><br />The only failure in this game was near the end, 2nd to last mission, where you're in a tank about to escape the satellite dish installation, and the game bugs out, gets stuck in some sort of &#34;event trigger&#34;. I had to restart that mission after powering down the Xbox (the next day) and it finished find the second time. Not quite losing a star for that, possibly a half, but since it recovered and only took 10 minutes of replay, that's okay. Thank goodness it wasn't a show-stopping bug over a year after release! I would expect a patch...<br /><br />Speaking of which, I never buy new games, but this one I did buy new--the Hardened edition was on sale, unopened, at a steep discount. I'm not a tightwad, but over the decades as a gamer (ha! you youngsters can't claim that...) I learned the hard way not to trust publishers on game day launches, so I never pre-order or even pay full retail these days. The CoD games are all worth $60, but for about 10 hours of fun, that's iffy value (compared to, say, Skyrim, where I spent 400 hours playing--but that is an extreme case, I'm sure you would agree).e-order or even pay full retail these days.

Pros:<br />-- Decent audio (I'm no expert so I can't say too much)<br />-- Good materials. Buttons, fabric, plastics etc are all nice and not cheap feeling<br />-- Lightweight. Didn't notice the weight after wearing for a while.<br />-- Long battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br />-- Ear pads are stiff and didn't sit well on my head. While the weight was good, the pads pressed on my head and hurt after a while as well as not 'sealing' as well as my X12's<br />-- Plenty of blinking lights to be had. The power button, bluetooth light and xbox bluetooth adapter all blinked during use. I would expect them to blink during pairing or turning on or similar but to remain off or on when in use.<br />-- The mic boom elbow doesn't detach. This is something I didn't understand when shopping around but decided to look past it and try them but when compared to other brands and models that are half the price that have a mic that completely detaches and doesn't have a silly elbow piece sticking out (such as the Creative Sound Blaster Tactic 3D Fury), it's a little disappointing.<br />-- Bluetooth is chat only. You cannot pair this with an iTouch or other device and listen to music. This one may not count as con since it's not meant to do this but either I did not see or notice this fact until after I figured out first hand I was unable to do so. I feel like this is something it should be able to do for the price.<br /><br />I suppose over all this isn't too bad of a headset but some minor changes to the design could have improved it significantly.	2015-08-04

Makes it easy to bring my Xbox with me on vacation. No more shoving my Xbox in a bag and hoping it doesn't get damaged. Only two complaints I have is that you can't store cables or controllers inside the case (or atleast it doesn't recommend it), and the screen is only 720p. I mean seriously, for $300+ it should have a 1080p screen, there's $120 19' monitors that are 1080p so this seems kinda ridiculous but it's certainly not a deal breaker. All in all, great product, I just wish it had a slightly better screen.	2015-08-04

I was all ready to play my Dance Dance Revolution game. When I was surprised to find out that this Wii does not have any game cube controller ports. NOT EVEN ONE!  The Wii I was replacing had FOUR. Any games that I have that need to connect through the port are now worthless. Who made this ridiculous decision? And why? Other than that, it's  awesome as usual.	2015-08-04

However, the game itself was lacking, the gameplay is emmersive initial but soon falls short. It is lacking in the playability after a few hours, with friends this an entirely different game and they can keep you playing but alone it gets boring pretty quick. The multiplayer isn't the greatest but it's ok. I would say this game is worth to play depending on what kind of deal you got. $10 yes, $25 noooooo, $60 that I payed for it, never again. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />I did enjoy hours on this game with my friend though so if you have a squad go for it	2015-08-04

US	28600501	R3THQO3BOYNP82	B00IQCRKT8	575580052	Batman: Arkham Knight	Video Games	3	1	1	N	N	Average game	I've been a fan of the series since the first game, Arkam Asylum, and I must say, out of the three core games, (excluding that Batman Origins mess) this one is my least favorite. There isn't anything really wrong with the game, but there isn't really anything right about it either. I shall diagnose my opinion of the game by breaking it down into pieces.<br /><br />Storyline: For me, there is simply too much filler. The story barely progresses at a steady clip, and it can get really confusing on what parts of the story are illusion or real, due to Batman's mental state. At random parts it hits the accelerator on giving facts out, only to once more go back to the confusing narrative direction. You will see most of the main villains, and some obscure one's as well, but most of them are taken out with a single take down strike or a few button presses, with only a couple of boss fights sprinkled in. But don't expect a strong ending, as the True Ending happens abruptly, and is rather open ended in how the player interprets it all.<br /><br />Gameplay: More or less the same as the prior two, with gadget use receiving an upgrade, as they can now be used in the air making approaches far more interesting. The combo system works well, as to be expected. The biggest draw the creators were hailing was the New BatMobile. For me, it's the worst addition to the series. It handles very loosely in it's normal state, and you spend ENTIRELY too much of the game fighting other tanks, making it feel like another game entirely.<br /><br />Graphics: Great on the Ps4, although I have seen way too many bugs, ranging from Batman walking backwards for no reason, to getting stuck in objects at random.<br /><br />There really isn't anything &#34;wrong&#34; with the game, but everything felt rushed and yet extremely padded out at the same time. When the action and story are working together, the game is great. But more often than not, you might end up finding yourself bored during many segments of the game.<br /><br />By the way, the main Villain is beaten in a cut scene. Not a quick time event, or a boss fight. The game literally fights the battle for you.	2015-08-04

If you still have access to a PS2, this is a must have! Most vast content of any Soul Calibur to this day! Most elaborate move sets (Not my fav for all the characters, but great!) Soul Calibur never had so many moves or characters: Not Before; Not Since! Best Create-A-Soul so far. It Will Inspire You! Not only do you get to utilize the standard and hidden characters moves on your creation, you get about 10 unique additional move sets to apply! And CaS has an entire game to itself with a substantial story! This edition made a break-through when the 8-way Run (the movement system ‚Äìfor the uninformed) was consistent with all the other movements: no hesitation. Evasively side-stepping is as effective as backing up, the same as moving forward!<br /><br />Many modes to enjoy, including the signature challenge scenarios. The intro sequence must be watched with reverence! Turn the lights down, don't blink! Get this if you are a content player. Get this and SC2 if you are a tournament player.	2015-08-04

I've written reviews of both games at one time or another, but a quick recap might be helpful. Halo Anniversary is a wonderful &#34;HD&#34; remake of the original first Halo: Combat Evolved, the first in the series. You can switch between old mode (showing the old Xbox graphics) and new HD mode, which is fun and startling. I found myself switching back and forth so much that I kept getting killed in the game. The original physics are still there from the old game, so only the graphics have been upgraded, not the gameplay or story or physics. That's okay, I prefer an exact duplication of the original without screwing it up.<br /><br />Reach is a brilliant game, not starring Master Chief, which I have played so much over the years with my son that it's an obvious 5-stars. I just bought a 2nd copy and an extra 360 so we can play locally via LAN in co-op mode. This is one of the best features of the Halo franchise that sets it way above most other games. Call of Duty series? NOPE! They don't offer LAN co-op--too bad, that would be fun. In fact, few games do it at all, let alone do it well. I haven't played the Master Chief Collection yet, as I don't own a One, so I'm referring to the 360 version here.<br /><br />When the price drops, this is a great way to get these two games at once. The logic of bundling these two together might not make sense at first until you've played Reach through to the end. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say, Halo: CE follows Reach naturally due to the ending (you'll see if you haven't played it through yet). In fact, it might be kind of fun to play Reach first, if you haven't ever enjoyed the brilliance of Halo: CE yet (where have you been!?).<br /><br />However, be mindful that both of these games have been out for many years already, so unless there's a really great sale on this bundle, it doesn't make much sense to buy it to save money since both can be had for a steep discount, not to mention the used market. I recommend buying one of the more exclusive versions of each game instead, even if you're coming into the series for the first time.ot to mention the used market.

Bought two of these so when my siblings are all together I can connect them to my PC using the mayflash wii u adapter. The first one I tried was great. The triggers were springy and the z a bit clicky but was overall still very responsive and was on par to the original. The texture of the d pad felt much better to me than the smash bros official GameCube controller that is out right now. The second controller unfortunately was not as good. As soon as I held it I could tell it was different. As I rotated the thumbstick it felt very off unlike the first, and soon realized the stick would get stuck if you pushed it in any bottom direction. Unfortunately I'll probably have to use an Xbox controller in the meantime for that one as shipping the item back would already be half the cost and too much effort. For 8 bucks I guess I'll just order a new one and cross my fingers to hope it matches the quality of the other controller they shipped me.	2015-08-04

I purchased this game and now am finding that my Alienware controller that worked for MLB2k9, does not work with this game. I've tried reconfiguring but if you have a certain button for pitching and try to use it for batting it gets changed or eliminated.

The controller on the bulky body actually feels about right, and the buttons and D-pad are not stiff, like other devices like this.  The screen is bright and has a 3-step brightness button (4th step is screen off), and the sound out of the device itself is so good, it must be heard to be believed.  I would put the audio on par with demo pods and display units you used to be able to find in stores that showcased the SNES.  Both video and audio reproduction seems identical to an actual SNES.  Inclusion of A/V out and controller connection dongle is icing on the cake, which allows me to use this as a TV-connected console.<br /><br />Additionally, the Retro Duo 2.0 seems to have better compatibility with third party peripherals.  I use an old ASCIIPAD by ASCIIWARE, and this works flawlessly, which is unlike a competing SNES portable device.  I did not find any games that didn't work with it, including Mega Man X, F-Zero, Star Fox, Super Double Dragon, Gradius III, and Shaq Fu*.<br /><br />* I recommend never actually playing Shaq Fu; I only tried it to test compatibility.	2015-08-04

He enjoys the game, but it's really frustrating that it doesn't work properly. There are areas where you need to use a character with a specific element in order to get through. For some of these areas, it still won't let him through when he is using the correct element character. It also will tell him he needs a specific trap and when he puts that trap in it doesn't work.. this isn't all the time, but it's often enough to seriously diminish the enjoyment of the game experience.	2015-08-04

Those games are fairly few and far between - the Elder Scrolls series, GTA, etc. So, I tried Far Cry 3 based on the solid reviews and really enjoyed it. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Elder Scrolls or GTA, but still enjoyable nonetheless. And with the open sandbox style of play and a multitude of side missions, it provided dozens of hours of gameplay. And it had a good story. I enjoyed seeing the evolution of Jason Brody from an adventure-seeking, but meek follower to a full-blown warrior. However, there was one thing that irked me about Jason is that the voice actor who played Jason didn't feel convincing as the fearless who'd take on an army of people. But other than that, I enjoyed it enough to play it three times through.<br /><br />So, with Far Cry 4, I was hoping for a similar experience and it didn't disappoint. Unlike Jason Brody, who didn't even know how to fire a gun at the beginning of Far Cry 3, Ajay Ghale, the protagonist in Far Cry 4, seems to be a fully-formed badass for mysterious reasons. He hits the ground running and the only thing holding him back is his arsenal. But as I was playing through the game, I felt like it was a whole lot like its predecessor. You're finding communication towers and hijacking the radio signal to open up more territory, taking over enemy compounds, and taking on a number of other side missions. It was so similar, in fact, that I felt like I was almost playing a re-skinned version of the same game.<br /><br />There were some new features, however. One of which was the main storyline requiring you to make a choice between two people battling for the leadership role of the Golden Path. You need to decide who you're going to side with, and the decision is never a clear cut one. This provides the opportunity for replay value as you'll inevitably be curious how things might turn out if you choose the other way.<br /><br />So, all in all, I've enjoyed the game after one play-through (I haven't completed all of the side missions yet, but most of them), but it just doesn't feel like it's breaking any new ground. If I had to do it all over, I'd buy it again, and I may even play it again. But it's not at the top of my great games list.n out if you choose the other way.<br /><br />So, all in all, I've enjoyed the game after one play-through (I haven't completed all of the side missions yet, but most of them), but it just doesn't feel like it's breaking any new ground.

Love it! I get really bad eye strain, headaches, and dry eyes because I use my computer most days for nearly the whole time I'm awake. I have really bad eye sight and honestly, I'm almost 100% sure that its because I spent so much time as a child on the computer for so long without proper eye protection. When I first wore these I could really feel the difference after a few hours. I was able to keep looking at the screen for much longer without having to take a break to rest my eyes, I haven't got headaches since I've started wearing these, and I wear contacts because of aforementioned bad vision, and I honestly can't stand wearing my contacts because they make my eyes super dry, but I can't wear my glasses with these glasses so I popped my contacts in and for the rest of the day I couldn't even tell I had them in. My eyes only got slightly dry but a few eye drops moistened them right back up and I was on my way back to typing. These glasses are so good at blocking out the fan and air conditioning wind and keeping my contacts from drying out that I can actually enjoy wearing them. The only downside was that since I bought these from amazon I wasn't able to get them in a prescription which I think I would have really enjoyed a lot more so that I didn't have the extra step of having to put in my contacts everyday, but oh well. Maybe in the near future I'll pick up the blue version of these from the actual Gunnar website and have them make it prescription. The color I got was intercept fire, which I thought would be like a fire truck red judging from the picture but its more of a orange-red color which I'm not sure I like, but I only wear these at home so I'm not bothered by the color for now. Overall though, I'm in love with these glasses. They seem really sturdy, I'm not sure what people have been doing to break theirs, although these are plastic, they are really thick. As long as you don't sit on them, or throw them against the wall or set something ontop of them, they should last a pretty long time.	2015-08-04

This controller feels the closest to the original, and in my opinion, actually feels even better!<br />The design is basically a 1:1 copy of the original, excluding the Nintendo logo on the front. But what really makes this thing shine is the buttons. Unlike most cheap third party NES controllers, the buttons have a tactile and responsive feel. You can feel every press and hear every satisfying click. I didn't even feel this satisfied mashing the buttons on my original NES controllers.<br /><br />This controller also eliminates the need to buy a separate adapter. There are NES controller-to-USB adapters out there that allow you to use the original controllers with your PC, but this controller has the USB cable built in, so it's just plug and play straight out of the box. The USB cable looks and feels like the original's cable, but is just slightly thinner. However it still feels secure and durable, and it is more than long enough if you're using it near your computer.<br /><br />This is the best third party NES controller I've used so far and is a must-buy for anyone who loves using emulators. Tested and works great on Windows 8.1 using emulators such Jsnes 1.1.1, FCEUX 2.2.2 and RetroArch 1.0.0.2. Just make sure to bind the controls to the right buttons on the controller in the input options of the emulator.	2015-08-04

Racing real cars on real tracks is my hobby that I do very often and I know for a fact that the cars don't handle that badly, this game gets frustrating when you try to go around turns but do a 360 every time I try and make a turn, not worth the price and not realistic racing even in the slightest.	2015-08-04

As a Zelda fan I enjoy taking my time and enjoying the experience (my favorite Zelda is Wind walker) but I decided to give this Zelda a shot and my god I'm so glad I did this Zelda is by far the most inventive and creative one yet the masks are a great mechanic the 3 day cycle gives a sense of looming doom to the land you begin to actually care about the characters in the world and you want to help them. Bottom line if your a Zelda fan get this game if you're not I still highly recommend you get this game!	2015-08-04

I've had this headset for less than a year now, and it has already fallen apart.  The construction is the lowest quality possible.  The arms on both sides have broken, the plastic where the ear cup rotates on the left side has completely broken down, and the speakers themselves have a tendency to cut out.  My advice:  don't buy Turtle Beach products until they learn how to actually build their headset properly.	2015-08-04

Pretty nice arcade stick for the price	Pretty basic Arcade stick with plug and play. So plug it in and you are good to go. I primarily use this for PC to play Mame games and arcade fighters such as Street Fighter IV. It is pretty responsive for newer games but the joystick is a bit too free range for older arcades such as Pac-Man where precision is absolutely necessary, but I am a bit of a Pac-Man prude... maybe I should just buy a Pac-Man Cab... Anyway. Since I am not using it with a PS2, the extra plug is kind of annoying hanging around.<br /><br />The build quality is a lot better than I had expected. It is a very affordable stick so I had expected a lack in quality but it was not so. The controls on the stick themselves are not as responsive as I would like them to be but much more responsive than I had previously expected them to be.<br /><br />The product leaves a lot of room for modding if you are interested in something you can expand on later on or you can just purchase a much more expensive arcade stick if you want something more. I don't mind doing a bit of modding and with the large blank spot on the front you can press your own vinyl on and replace the directional stick and arcade buttons with better quality switches. If you plan on replacing the switches you may want to have a dremel tool, sander or a friend with either one.<br /><br />All in all. Pretty nice arcade stick for the price	2015-08-04

I have a projector setup but it doesn't have HDMI, so I have to downgrade the signal type. I connected this cable up and it made a nice secure connection to the WiiU and the RCAs side as well. The cable itself has a nice sturdy feel and build quality to it. It is certainly a nice replacement or addition if you require RCA connections. I have used the WiiU with this cable a few times and extended amount of hours with no issues. The video and audio have been solid on this cable so far. I have also connected and unconnected the cable a few times as well. A nice connection each time. I'm not sure how long any cable can endure multiple connect/reconnects but so far this one is working out great for me. It has about 4 to 5 feet of cable itself, so it can connect via a TV stand or such without issue. Its pretty much a duplicate of the original WiiU RCA cables.	2015-08-04

Coming on the heels of major failure of a set of Turtle Beach 500Ps, the reinforced headband on the Krals is a much needed feature.  I've run the gamut of wireless gaming headsets and this one delivers, but mostly on a technical level.  PC and PS4 connectivity is literally plug&play - no issues there.  Audio and mic quality is very good as well as a good compliment of features with easy controls.<br /><br />My biggest problem is fit and to a lesser degree, weight.  Although the earcups should be of adequate size, the earpad rim is too wide which creates a very small opening for the actual ears. I have very average adult ears but I do have a large head (and NO, I'm not Shrek! :) )  Speaking of large heads, if you have one this is not the headset for you either as the headband is on the snug side.  That said, I believe younger kids with smaller frames should have no problems with the ergonomics such that I've experienced.  And based on my observations, the Krals have an above-average build quality with metal components in just the right places.<br /><br />Because of the observed quality, I'm still keeping them for backup.	2015-08-04

I myself haven't played a single Professor Layton game, and have only played one Phoenix Wright game before playing this. But I can tell you, this game made me want to play more. I want to play all the other Phoenix Wright games, and the Professor Layton games, if they're as good as this one. Since this is a very story focused game I can't really reveal too much that isn't gameplay. Basically, Phoenix Wright and Professor Layton both take place in the same universe now, no alternate universe story lines taking place here, which I'm thankful for. They're thrown into a big mystery in which they'll need to combine their skills; Phoenix Wrights detective and lawyering skills, and Layton's puzzle solving. The story itself is really good, just like the only Phoenix Wright game I played (which is Dual Destinies by the way) it really keeps you guessing and pulls some interesting and believable twists within the universe they set. What might put people off is the ending, I personally really enjoyed it, but others may see it a bit as a Deus Ex Machina, it's not necessarily bad, but it just may take a lot for most people to buy what's being presented. But overall the game's amazing, and really delivers on the great and fitting crossover it promises. If your a Phoenix Wright fan pick, this up, you may even find you'll like the Professor Layton games too, and same goes for all you Layton fans.	2015-08-04

The game was awesome. The statute though. It would be rated a five but the main reason it is not is because the statute does not look like it does in the picture provide by Amazon. I was like &#34;what the heck. I just got bamboozle.&#34; If I would have know that the statute meant paint it yourself I would have spent the money on something else. I often refrain from posting reviews but this one hit me right on the spot	2015-08-04

This is by far the best headset I've ever owned (&amp; I've used some over $100). I highly recommend these. If I had to point out a con the pads for the ears could be a tiny bit softer like on the wired version.<br /><br />!!!!!UPDATE!!!!<br /><br />Everything &quot;Amazon'&quot; had to do with this order (shipping, customer service, etc) was exemplary... however, the product itself has a serious material/design flaw &amp; will break just above the earpiece even with minimal use &amp; great care taken to protect &amp; take good care of them. I'm older, live alone so nobody else even has access to my things &amp; I take EXTREMELY good care of my electronics/accessories. I used my first set of these headsets for about 3mos, never even dropped them and they fell apart. Amazon was good enough to replace them free of charge &amp; the 2nd set didn't even last a month &amp; a half breaking in the exact same place. I did some searching online &amp; discovered this is a recurring problem across the board, there's even some 'fix it' videos out on Youtube for those of you that have some too far out of warranty for replacement.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed to as (before breaking) these were the best headsets I'd owned but I don't recommend spending $$ on them until this issue is resolved at the manufacturer.	2015-08-04

These don't appear to be 7.1 Surround Sound like the Sony, but those were so tight it hurt my ears/head and eventually broke in the center of the band over the head because apparently they were sized to fit infants only. The sound quality is good, and I also use them for listening to music from my laptop. I have also used them for my phone with the boom mic and sound quality was good on both ends. Could use a small foam piece over the microphone to reduce the sound of wind from breathing (pretty sensitive)  For the price I got these for on Prime Day (&#60;$20), you really can't get better.  EDIT: After 3 months of maybe once or twice a week use on average, these broke at the left where the swivel piece becomes the strap. This was very sudden and with no warning.  I was putting the headset on and it snapped. Submitted a ticket with Turtle Beach last night.  Will follow up. I don't have a large head by any means, so this was shocking.  EDIT: Turtle Beach support offered to replace if I sent them the broken headset.  The cost to ship the headset to them would have been as much as I paid for them, and likely just for the same model that will have the same issue.  I didn't bother returning them for a new pair and will look for something else as a replacement.  Fairly disappointed	2015-08-04

This thing is the fastest box I ever hooked up to my 65&#34;4k TV ever.. downloaded Kodi and added the silence rom app , and oh my God what a sweet set up . I can now say cutting the cord is a must now, even stopping Netflix and Hulu . With Kodi you dont need that extra payment . And when I say fast I mean fast , my download speed is around 75 to 85mps with Comcast. When you hit enter the video starts with in a second or two, even on YouTube playing a 4k video ..you pick a movie on Netflix hit play the load symbol spins 0% 50% 99%  and plays all in about one second to two seconds.I will say setting the shield to 4k mode puts my TV in the 4k resolution, but the pic looks not as sharp as it can be even upping the sharpness to 100 looks like it is not a difference, I know its not my TV ,  if I run my WD Live TV box in 1080p 24hz with my unconverted HDMI cable. It runs TV in 4k and picture is amazing, so I think it must have something to do with the shield. But even setting the shield to 1080p mode still makes 4k content look amazing too .  I did stream street fighter from NVIDIA and set it to 1080p 60hz and played with no lag or problems, it runs smooth. But over all great little box for the price.  I got the 16g and put in a SD card for more storage.  Don't think if you know what you want this box for you will be very happy, I know I am!	2015-08-04

The tint is very nice and really helps my eyes feel better about staring at a monitor for long hours. Very few people will ever see you wearing these, so don't buy based upon a cool look, buy the ones which make your eyes feel best -- which is this design with flat lenses. The flat lens design is vastly superior, in my opinion, to the curved lens versions. They have absolutely no visual distortion and the frame fits your nose very nicely so there is no light bleed from the center. My one complaint is that these, and apparently all Gunnars, have a small but noticeable magnification which isn't mentioned on any of the product descriptions. I love the tint but have sensitive eyes so the magnification causes me eyestrain. If there were Gunnars available without that magnification I would buy them in a heartbeat.	2015-08-04

As a previous wii fit (older edition, several years ago) owner, who got rather frustrated after gaining 20lbs in one day (The board and I highly disagreed on this) and donated it, this updated edition is quite pleasant. It's mostly the same, though, my weight seems to be accurate this time around and the extra activities are lovely. I don't see it holding kids attention by any means, unless you have a particularly calm child who is already in to the fitness type games (dance games, etc).<br /><br />For fitness buffs, this is little more than a video game that occasionally uses your legs, but for chronically ill, couch potatoes, I-need-to-go-to-the-gym-but-I-don't-ers, this is a fun intro to moving more. It wont give you a fancy work out, or serious limit pushing exercise, but it is something I can keep on doing when the heat outside is prohibitive to walking/running, or really going anywhere.<br /><br />As for helping my balance, I'm not convinced a game board can fix my actual disorder (I suffer from meniere's disease), but it is fun to try, and it doesn't seem to make the wobbly feeling worse. (I am not a doctor, please be careful when feeling vertigo/dizziness!)<br /><br />Overall, it's a fun device, maybe not for serious workouts, but for replacing telly/internet time with movement, it's perfect.	2015-08-04

At this point, I honestly can't tell if people are just trolling for the sake of trolling, or they actually dislike the game that much.  I have now spent about a week playing it after buying &#34;The Golf Club&#34; first.  I have to say, I disagree pretty strongly with all the negative comments about this game. This review will do a lot of comparing to TGC for those of you trying to decide.  The PROS: -The graphics are good.  They aren't phenomenal for what you would expect from XBONE, but they completely put to shame &#34;TGC&#34; which had pathetic graphics.  The wildlife is a bit over the top, but the courses and the players look great! -The gameplay is fantastic.  The fact that there are 3 different ways to play and on top of that you have the ability to customize it to any combination of the 3 is by far the best thing about this game.  The putting seems to be relatively true and not super easy and i like that the lies play pretty realistic.  The &#34;tour&#34; controller mode takes both your back and front swing into account, which i think adds a nice dynamic and makes it more rewarding to hit the perfect shot. -Career mode is a nice touch.  I play golf games for the career mode and to play locally with friends.  The career mode is dumbed down, but still fun.  This is the first attempt for this series on a new-gen system, so i expected it to be pretty basic (madden, nhl, nba live all had the same thing).  It sucks, but it's come to be expected and it looks like EA is going to continue to support the game.  There are enough clubs, apparel, options to make it fun to switch things up. -Night Club Challenge.  A lot of people were hating on this mode, but I think it's a great breakaway from the traditional round of golf.  There is variety to it and it's better than having nothing &#34;extra&#34;.  I would really like to see them add mini-golf to future iterations.  CONS: -LACK OF CONTENT.  This is the one GLARING negative that I will agree with a lot of you on.  Tolaunch with 8 real courses and a couple BS fantasy ones is a slap in the face to people who spent 60 bucks on this game.  I personally bought it on ebay for 35.. and at that value, it's well worth it.  Adding two courses here soon is nice, but they should have been on the game at launch and then they should add another 10 courses for free.  I don't mind the fantasy courses as they are decent as well, but there really should be more.  The amount of golfers on the game doesn't really bother me that badly.  It would be nice to have a roster of 20 or so, but i play with my own character more often than not. -create-a-player is very basic.  This doesn't bother me that much, but i can see why it might others.  I could care less what my character looks like as long as he has my name, but they could have incorporated some variety.  OVERALL: I have had a lot of fun playing this game in the first week.  The Golf Club offers more by way of courses, but the graphics suck and there is virtually no customization to character, progression system, and a dumbed down career mode.  This game provides all that and although it doesn't give me the fully baked game we were all hoping for, it still does what I was hoping it would.  Which is provide fun golf with a decent career mode and solid graphics.  I would give it 7.5/10.  EA DOES NEED TO MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF COURSES THOUGH, so let's hope they keep the free DLC coming.	2015-08-04

There is a lot of fan service in this game and it can be fun to unlock and couple together your hard earned rewards. Unfortunately the actual gameplay is where this game falls short for me. The battle system is extremely basic, does not include beam battles and stat distribution can highly cripple your character performance if you do not specialize in one area. The hub / social area where you can choose your next activity and view other players is very bland, boring and the fact it is divided into sections which require loading screens makes just getting from A to B tedious, especially since you can only run. I would be a lot more forgiving of all of these areas if the stage maps were much larger including a much more intelligent AI. Stage maps are often extremely small, with invisible walls blocking you off from creating your dream battle. Including warp gates as a method to transporting from stage to stage inside of an activity (called parallel quests) is tacky and could have been performed in a much more intuitive and immersive way.<br /><br />A refreshing step forward from the standard Dragon Ball fighter, but falls short of nearly all expectations.	2015-08-04

It's a sesame episode with some fantastic Kinect interaction. Little details such as:<br />- Seeing yourself in an on screen mirror<br />- Being in the scene with a Sesame character<br />- Throwing things at the characters for them to catch<br />- Taking 'pictures' of a scene by saying 'picture'<br /><br />All make the interactive parts of the shows a very fun change from just standard tv. For most of the episode it really is similar to tv (my kids sit on the couch, they won't stand where the kinect can 'see' them), but the interactive parts at beginning and end of each episode have them standing up and jumping around.<br /><br />I've got two young kids. The stand near each other, and it works quite well. There are times where only one of them will appear in the mirror, or in the Sesame scene, but usually they both appear. It hasn't been a problem.	2015-08-04

I was able to charge my controllers and never once had them run out of battery while putting them on the charger with every use. The LED's do work appropriately but they are very bright so if the are in any area where you plan to sleep you might want to choose another product. My major complaint is I had one battery go bad on my and when I went to contact the company they told me they do not sell the battery packs separately so if you plan to get replacements you have to buy a whole new charger. So after the disappointment with after warranty support I have decided to go to another charger.	2015-08-04

The seller notified me via email that the item was trying to be delivered on a Saturday but wasnt able to and i was pleased and impressed by trying to assure their customer got their order. I told them it was my place of work and would arrive the next business day, and they responded giving me helpful advice on how to install the product, although their grasp of the language was a tad off, but still understandable. The package arrived in perfect condition and even though there were no instructions it was extremely simple to understand what to do. I cleaned my ps4 and controller and proceeded to apply the sticker to my controller first. This part was the most difficult as the sticker was very thin in certain spots but didnt rip or tear, and went on real quick. The whole process of applying to my ps4 went beyond simple, easy removal from the paper, barely any air bubbles and reapplying was easy as hell and not a bit of residue was left. My ps4 now looks damn cool. The only issue i have is that the one that i received wasn't the same one in the photo for the system.  The batman logo isnt both on the top and front right side, and the PS4 logo and arkham logo arent on the stickers, and the bottom right sticker isnt the same with the arrangment of bats, but still matches the rest of the colors.	2015-08-04

It feels like a new game because of that.  On the one hand, some areas were a little easier.  Some areas wouldn't be hard if, for instance, they hadn't multiplied enemies or increased the number of dark spirit invasions.<br />and sometimes you walk into an area only to run away because there is a scary looking new enemy there waiting to one hit you. lolz.<br />And I am still wondering if any online players will actually ever lay a summon symbol in the belfry sol and that gargoyle fight is awful and my least favorite battle--and because it seems like the pvp invasions have increased greatly in that area.<br />Finally, I had forgotten how easy the game is on the first play through so I cannot speak to the difficulty of completing it on new game plus yet.<br />On a funny note, I was playing it after bloodborne and found myself making the awful mistake of thinking that my health was being restored by my hits.  Silly.<br /> I have not found any of those rings that preserve your souls and then break yet [do they exist in this version?]<br />I don't know much about the pc version but I imagine if you have a decent computer with a good graphics card it will look lovely.<br />-Happy Girl in NH	2015-08-04

I know that Ubisoft wants to fit the times when they make their AC games and have them be true to their time period, but I've never been one for boat missions. I was alright with Connor because their weren't as many boat adventures that were mandatory to progress in the game but this one has a lot more, especially since he's a pirate. He doesn't have much of a personality either. He's not even a real assassin, he stole the uniform and worked with the Templars before leaving because they found out he was the not the man they thought he was. I am not a fan of the Pirate life.	2015-08-04

Rather than hand-hold you through ridiculously tedious fetch quests and relentlessly tie you to the main storyline, Black Flag offers a welcome breath of freedom and variety the game's preceding titles so often sorely lacked.<br /><br />Replete with the parkour acrobatics and impressive, historically accurate locales that made previous entries such robust affairs, ACIV pushes the envelope with a truly open world ripe to be explored and plundered. Within the space of an hour, you'll captain a ship, ferrying across the Caribbean to islands uninhabited and bustling alike. Cities and towns are wondrously detailed and filled with fun distractions from the very beginning. The seas themselves provide perhaps the most enticing draw of all: naval battles. Building off the ACIII's jaunt into ship-to-ship warfare, Black Flag nails a multi-faceted and strategically engrossing combat system that easily overshadows the paltry melee offerings of the first few titles. Controls are easy to grasp, and it never gets old blasting a ship halfway to oblivion before storming its decks and claiming it for your own.<br /><br />While the storyline is still steeped in totally underwhelming, half-baked Templar-Assassin sci-fi mythos, Black Flag's entertaining cast of rapscallion pirates ARRRGH undeniably flavorful and well-acted all around. Likewise, the &#34;meanwhile IRL&#34; subplot about Abstergo Entertainment is a welcome change to the franchise's signature framing device, offering a hearty heap of gaming industry humor to the high-seas yarn truly at hand.<br /><br />The visuals are breathtaking, even on aging hardware like the 360. Both the digital denizens and fauna of ACIV's Caribbean behave organically with the immersive environments around them, and a wide spectrum of locations makes for an unending sense of adventure. In honesty, this game is nearly as rewarding and astounding as any GTA title has ever been: it is leaps and bounds more accomplished that ACIII and should be recognized as a developer's guide to properly evolving an ongoing franchise. Terrific purchase.	2015-08-04

I'm a huge fan of the first two games in the series so I had high hopes coming in.  First off, the graphics look great.  It feels like a nice upgrade from the previous two in that aspect. The game play when you are running around, fighting, gliding as Batman are just as good and there are some added moves to make things a little more fun.<br /><br />The story is fun.  I'm not sure it is as quite as good as the other, but that could be because the main villain has changed.  Scarecrow is good, but it feels like the Arkham Knight is sort of the main bad guy.<br /><br />My only complain is really being forced to used the Batmobile  The Batmobile is fun to an extent, but when you are forced to use it for certain missions it gets a little repetitive.  Personally I would much rather explore the city as Batman flying around rather than driving the Batmobile.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the game, but I think I would rate it my least favorite out of the three games.	2015-08-04

Audio and graphics come pretty close to the original, maybe a little crisper sound and brighter colors. It's a system that uses new parts, so of course the audio and graphics won't match the original exactly. My only complaint would be perhaps having an alternative plug, one where the adapter is not combined with the plug. The controllers are simple generic controllers. Expect the d-pads to be a little wonky. Other than that, it is a great system.<br />Final thoughts: there is an NES clone console by Gamerz Tek and unfortunately, that is not available on Amazon. That is also a fantastic system. I look forward to seeing other products by this company, perhaps controllers and whatnot. Very impressed by these systems. Lots of love and appreciation for the original systems was placed into making these things, which is sadly not what I can say for other retro and clone consoles on the market.	2015-08-04

However also considering what you pay for it, I expect it to be flawless and my unit seemed to ship with a very annoying stuck pixel near the center that I just can't get to disappear. I would order a replacement but having to wait a month for that to happen is just too long so I quickly cancelled the replacement. I can't seem to get the maker of the device to comment on what to do either (I'm not sure 1 pixel is covered under warranty). I will just have to deal with the stuck pixel for the life of the device and hope it goes away. I seem to have this kind of luck with these things lately. I typically avoid consoles with screens due to the chance of having stuck pixels, but this is something I just had to have unfortunately, and I paid the price.	2015-08-04

My home theater produces good sound, so this chat mic offers everything I need to talk to my friends.<br /><br />First, a small caveat: unless you have the new Xbox One controller, you will need to buy the [[ASIN:B00IAVDOS6 Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter]] in order to use this headset. If you do have a controller with headset jack, then the Recon 30X has all the controls you need with in-line mute toggle and volume control.<br /><br />My friends report that my voice was crystal clear using this headset. I was very happy with the slotted ear piece design.  The design allows users to hear themselves talk, so I would speak at a normal volume.  Full-ear headphones often muffle the user's voice, and in order to compensate users will yell to hear themselves.  Moreover I could hear if family members were trying to talk to me.<br /><br />I would recommend these headphones if you have a good sound level from your TV/sound system and you need to be able to hear what is going on in your home.	2015-08-04

It's nothing like Skyrim, all it is from my short experience, is a buncha kids running around in robes with wands and swords and fake magic nonsense.  it's like the Harry Potter of MMO's and there doesn't seem to be any real direction.  sure there are silly side missions everywhere and ultimately an end?  I guess?  But this is probably worth about 20 bucks.  tops.<br />Good news is it does play smoothly but the game is just stupid.<br /><br />I feel like this game is for today's modern day Dungeons and Dragons meetings or gatherings that would take place in the 80's and 90's except this time it's an unorganized cluster Fuq that involves cowards.  and the people are just mean, not the quiet nerdy elve-like people that wear Izod Polos with Fanny packs and high tops but wannabee 'Tough guy' individuals that shout excessive profanity into their headsets to sound intimidating.  In reality they are mostly the kind of people that would run 1st if there were ever a real confrontation that involves violence. These people would not fight alongside of you in 'Nam.  If games existed online back in the later 1960's they would be hiding in them and wouldn't even protest let alone go fight a real battle.<br /><br />I'd rather dip my balls out of my zipper on a 6 lane freeway going 90 mph and have my sac drag along the hot summer asphalt then have to play this silly game again.  I gave it 2 starts because I was admittedly impressed how smooth it plays for an online only MMO game.  But then again what the hell is it i'm playing??  Garbage & Nonsense.<br /><br />I really wouldn't waste your time with this.  Just replay Skyrim or a real game produced by Bethesda not this piece of crap.	2015-08-04

Last June I decided to finally get in shape and lose some weight. Knowing how much I detest exercising I knew I needed to find something that I could stick with in order to achieve my goal of losing 40 pounds. I grew up in the 80s and was a video gamer through and through so when I saw there was a video game that included dancing and music, I had to try it. Just Dance 4 was the first one that I purchased. It was really great so after that I purchased Just Dance Greatest Hits, 2014, and 2015. In my opinion they are all great, some better than others. The songs are also great. You get a real mixture of genres so most everyone can find songs they enjoy dancing to. I just wish Nintendo would release more DLCs and more frequently. I was able to lose those forty pounds by last October and almost a year later have managed to keep it off and maintain using Just Dance and a balanced diet. I am so thankful for these games because if it hadn't been for them, this gamer would probably still be forty pounds heavier and vegging out in front of a different kind of video game. Thank you UBI Soft and Nintendo. I am including an after picture and a picture of all the clothes that I donated because they didn't fit anymore. Thanks to Just Dance and following a balanced diet (logging everything into the Lose it! app daily) I was able to lose the weight.  If you find my review helpful please let me know and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below and I will answer them as quickly as possible.   Thank you for checking out my review.   :)	2015-08-04

We held off - maybe for too long. We had the Wii - and didn't realize how much the Wii U adds. I personally love the fact that when I'm gaming and someone wants to watch something on the TV, I can often switch to playing on the Gamepad. But aside from that, the games are awesome, challenging, fun, and most of them have some group play. Our entire family enjoys the Wii U - usually at the same time - and that makes for one happy family! Whether it's golf and bowling or Splatoon or Mario 3D World or a Party game - everyone gets to have fun, regardless of their experience level. More games, hi def, more group games, &#34;off-TV&#34; playing, Online connectivity - Such Fun!<br /><br />We have Xbox, we have PlayStation - neither of them get anywhere near the same use as our Wii U. Each is great in its own way, each has some great franchise games. Nintendo has more - and Nintendo has more family friendly & fun games - AND Nintendo is backward compatible two generations, with a massive library of classic downloadable games from older consoles!!! [As of this writing, Xbox One still doesn't play Xbox 360 games, and PlayStation 4 wants to charge an additional fee to play PlayStation 3 games you've already purchased!]<br /><br />Truly, the Wii U is the best fun for any family - worth every cent - and each game that we've purchased truly offers tons of great play - that's even great fun the second time around, or playing with new friends & family!	2015-08-04

I got my PS4 and I was ready to play a next-gen game! After beating the first level, I noticed something. I wasn't bored, but I was also not having any fun at all. That's a feeling that goes on the entire time you play this game. Every level is so incredibly average. There's absolutely nothing special about this game. The characters are very linear and have no depth. One character has a &#34;tragic&#34; back story, but it's not enough to make me care about him. Knack himself really doesn't stand out as a character. Nothing he says makes you like him, and most of his lines are cheesy and have been said by every other &#34;super cool&#34; clich√© character. The story isn't really anything worth mentioning. Imagine Uncharted, but not interesting. The villains try too hard to make you not like them, but aside from the girl (who reminded me of an evil, not cool, Laura Croft) I really didn't mind any of the enemies. The music is so easy to miss I almost forgot it had music, so nothing worth mentioning there. And then there's the gameplay. At a first glance, this game seems like it might be really fun. Don't let that fool you, it's not. Every level starts you off as a tiny version of Knack. EVERY LEVEL! Playing as him makes you feel defenseless and incredibly weak. It's not until at least half way through EVERY LEVEL you become as strong as a level one character in any other game. But, every level has a point where you become pretty big, or in some cases massive. This is when the game gets fun. It's always entertaining running around smashing tanks with one punch. Sadly, every single time you become huge and start actually having fun, it takes no more than three minutes for the game to come up with a lame excuse to shrink you back down and make you weak again. There really isn't anything wrong with this game, it's just that there isn't anything wonderful<br />about it either. If you're looking for the next-gen experience,look elsewhere.	2015-08-04

I had to wait 48 hours for a customer service email response with instructions on how to factory reset it. Then I had to update it again, which worked.<br />3. The unit was then usable for 2 weeks and then would no longer turn on.

I compared these with my Sennheisers, which are known for great fidelity, and the X300 was equal or better in fidelity and accuracy. The explosions come through great without being muted or overdone. The microphone is really convenient because it slides out of the way into one earpiece for playing without the internet. They are comfortable and cut out most outside noise while still letting you hear someone calling you nearby.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is that the material that touches your skin can get a bit sweaty over long play times. I prefer the fabric used on the Sennheisers because it never gets hot against your skin. If this isn't a problem for you, then these are top notch headphones you should seriously consider.<br /><br />As a side note, these make great headphones for listening to music on an iPhone since you can make and answer calls using the built-in microphone.	2015-08-04

This review is of the correct item.<br /><br />Playing your PSP games on the big screen may sound awesome (and it certainly is sometimes) but it's not without it's drawbacks.  First, the item worked flawlessly - but it will ONLY work with the PSP 2000 and 3000 lines - if you have a PSP 1000, there is no way that I know of of getting your A/V output to another screen.  Second, this does not enhance the quality of the image it puts out - textures and polygon shapes that look great on the tiny PSP screen don't look nearly as good when played on a large TV - especially at the 480 resolution the composite cables are limited to.  Finally, given the length of the cable (I didn't measure it, but it seems to be about 6 feet or so), it's impossible to really play any substantial distance away from your TV unless you want to go through the trouble of buying a composite extension cord.  To that end, while it's a cool idea, it certainly has limited applications.	2015-08-04

There isn't any lag at all. Games like CoD, Assassins Creed, and Infamous all run perfect.  The console itself and the games all still get updates so you know Sony hasn't given up on the PS3 yet, and I can see why. This console is amazing. Also, I've never even gotten a low on space warning and I have at least 20 games. The only down side I would have to say is the noise the console makes. It doesn't make that much noise but if it's just you in the room and there's not much noise you can here a noise. I think it's just the disc spinning but still, it's noticeable.  Other than that this console is amazing. I have never used an Xbox so I can't compare the two but I don't see how it can be any better than this. The price is amazing and I would recommended this to anyone any day.	2015-08-04

So, instead of buying a new controller, I chose to buy these. First, they are really, really close to manufacturers pads. I actually prefer the rubber on these compared to Sonys. Second, they are super easy to install. I got on YouTube and found a tutorial on how to do it. It took me less than 10 minutes to install them. So, I suggest these instead of replacing the controller or buying thumb grips to cover them. They also have tons of different colors so you get to kind of &#34;mod&#34; your controller in a small way. Shipped fast and packaged well. Definitely will buy from E-Mod again when my kids chew through these.	2015-08-04

The buttons worked well and were very responsive to the games I had used it on.  Overall, this controller seems very similar to the standard Xbox controller, all features are on point.  The only real problem I had was that the LB, LT, RB, and RT buttons/triggers had a very rough plastic feel to them.  The triggers didn't have the smooth glide that could be obtained from an actual Xbox 360 controller, and the left and right buttons made very loud clicking sounds.  However, the end result of this controller was a fairly well-built gamepad that worked exceptionally well for casual and light PC gaming.<br /><br />Installation was extremely easy, all I had to do was download the appropriate drivers from the Microsoft website, plug in the USB, and I was ready to go.  Most games automatically recognized the controller and switched from keyboard support to controller.  As I don't happen to own an Xbox 360, I was not able to observe gameplay on the console itself, but the controller handled very well for all my PC games and applications  I would recommend this controller to anyone looking for a cheaper yet durable alternative to an Xbox controller, whether it be for PC gaming or console gaming.	2015-08-04
