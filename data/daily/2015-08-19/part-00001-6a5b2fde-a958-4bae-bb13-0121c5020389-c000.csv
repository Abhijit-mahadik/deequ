I have an entertainment setup where I have to have my PS4 horizontal and I had to make some changes to this charger. The base uses both USB ports, one for each set of chargers, and the fan runs off either one. I have to set this off to the side of my center, run a USB extension for the front chargers. I only have one controller so this is no big deal. Thankfully the fan can be turned off by a button, but it's also very loud. Louder than the PS4 itself (which is almost whisper quiet). I feel cheap fans were used in this base and there's no speed control. Overall, it's a solid base if you use more than two controllers or use your PS4 vertically.<br /><br />There is one thing I need to point out. Fans are pretty much useless for consoles unless it's in a spot where it will overheat. The PS4 has great heat distribution and does not overheat, so you may want to look elsewhere for just charging your controllers.	2015-08-19

US	47544662	R2DTWJ7SWIGHIB	B00KWFCV32	16819689	Splatoon	Video Games	5	0	0	N	N	Tons of Inktastic fun!	This game is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! The whole idea of the game is ingenious. I was skeptical to buy this game at first because, how fun can it really be to throw ink on floors?? It took me a couple of months to decide to actually get this game and finally decided to just get it and use the excuse to get it for my daughter on her birthday early August. My daughter just loves it. Then I tried it, and man, I can't seem to be able to put it down! The game is beautiful, with vibrant colors, awesome character animation, and audio that really ties the whole game together. The online battles are tons of fun. I just lover splatting other Inklings with my Splattershot and seeing their little ghost fly away. This game is definitely unique in the fact that there are no games out there like it. My only two very very small gripes are that Nintendo should allow online chat, - I mean, come on Nintendo, it's 2015 for crying out loud! - and also, the fact that only truly one person can enjoy the game locally playing it. But the online matches are short enough (only 3 min) that taking turns with another sibling/ inkling, should not be a problem. Splatoon's single player story mode is also pretty cool, and is definitely worth a play through. Overall, Splatoon is an incredible game and is definitely worth its cost. -well at least it is for me! If you are on the line about this game, and it kind of looks cool to you but haven't made up your mind, just get it! You will definitely have tons of fun splatting the crap out of other inklings and covering as much turf with your teams ink color... if you are able to that is! Good Luck!	2015-08-19

You have to buy or have a charge cord already.<br />I bought this because our cord was destroyed. I was surprised when it was just the charging station and no cord to be found. Once we finally got a cord we plugged everything up and it was cool for about five seconds. It was apparent that actually &#34;plugging&#34; the controllers up was harder than it seemed. You have to move and push them in at just the right angle or they won't plug up. Also it would only charge one controller at a time. It charges one and once it's charged moves onto the next one. That can be annoying if you want both charged sooner.<br />We've had this station for a month maybe two and now if you try to plug both controllers on it the LED light turns off and it won't charge at all. So now you can only put one on at a time or it doesn't even work.<br />Overall it's a POS with fancy blue LED lights. Woohoo!	2015-08-19

I had been hearing about 7.1 digital surround sound headsets. I thought I would pick some up.<br /><br />I chose these over the Sony ones because of price style and features were better in my opinion.<br /><br />I prefer the removable boom mic rather than the built in ones.<br /><br />They're not as comfortable as I'd have hoped. They are tolerable for extended periods of time.<br /><br />The batteries I think last hours beyond the advertised life which is ridiculously long already.<br /><br />The 7.1 digital surround is not as impressive asi would have hoped. It's pretty much just spacially calculated reverb to simulate sound bouncing off the walls. Nifty trick, it does help with echo location.... Literally.<br /><br />These are not fully cross compatible with anything other than a PS4 you will not get the digital surround without having a device with an optical port.<br /><br />I like them, but I don't use them as often as I thought I would have.	2015-08-19

When this arrived, we pulled out the cord and ran this inline and it works like a charm and we have several feet of wiring left. Couldn't ask for much more than that!

This is also a great for people who didn't play Code Embryo as the game follows two new characters and uses the events of the first game as memories.  What I mean by that is that the new characters don't know the events of the Code Embryo, so you don't need to have played it to enjoy the storyline.<br /><br />As with the first game, the story, characters, graphics and music are all superb.  Overall, this is an excellent addition to the Xblaze series and a great visual novel game for newcomers to the genre.	2015-08-19

The ability to pick your own path through the game always makes the replay value go way up.  In the first Mega Man X game the creators at Capcom upped the anti by adding 4 armor upgrades, heart tanks and a revised subtank system.  What I took away from this game was how wonderful the play control is.  X is very responsive and with the ability to cling and slide down walls and springboard off gives the player a lot of freedom of movement not found in the old NES games.  I originally thought of the old NES Ninja Gaiden games when I first played it.  Mega Man X and Super Metroid probably have the best overall play control of any games on the SNES and should be included in everyone's gaming library.<br /><br />The game is a blast to play the rock music fits the atmosphere perfectly and the future Blue Bomber is a force to be reckoned with when he is fully upgraded.  I liked the idea of using animals as bosses instead of just &#34;Man&#34;.  The environmental changes in the game are also very unique and add a new perspective on the game.  The backgrounds and stage layouts are interesting and the bosses are fun.  The learning curve is pretty quick and once you learn the dash technique you will be zipping through the game. I also liked the idea of being able to Power up your boss weapons into supercharged weapons once you have the X-buster upgrade.<br /><br />All the mini bosses put up a decent fight as well. The challenge is about average, its not very difficult nor is it a cakewalk either.  I liked how the creators had a stage like Armored Armadillo that let you fill up your subtanks quickly by killing the bats getting all the energy.  I thought the Spider boss always put up a good fight and enjoyed every battle with it.  Sigma is a very good villain, more fearsome than Dr. Wiley.  Besides I was getting tired of fighting Dr. Wily anyway.  The X-series games would get better but the first one is definitelyworth playing.  I would rate this a 5 star game.<br /><br />Gameplay: 9<br />Play Control: 10<br />Story\Originality: 8<br />Challenge: 8<br />Replay Value: 9	2015-08-19

The game just feels like it was rushed out the door.  Several reviewers have commented on how uninspiring the music is in the game and they are right.  In several stages the sound just seems flat and boring except the Vile battle.  Also the game felt like it had too many upgrades, many of which seemed useless to me while playing the game.  What is the point of having 6 capsules if you can only pick 4.  I liked how they brought Vile back and that the game was more challenging than X2 but not really in a good way.  I loved fighting all 3 of the semi villains Bit, Bite and the other guy in X2 I thought that added a lot to the story and was fun.  you get none of that enjoyment from X3 no backstory on the mini bosses.  You do get to play as Zero in this game but I did not find him very easy to use or very practical to use in the game, he is much better in MMX4<br /><br />Also the one major inconvenience I found in the game was there was no enemy similar to the bats in MMX that would always drop energy pellets or capsules where you could quickly fill up your subtanks.  Or the water stage in MMX2 where you could quickly suck up 9 energy capsules right away to fill your tanks in seconds. Once you get to the final stages of X3 you will need every drop of those subtanks to deal with the cheap attacks from Vile and Sigma and it takes forever to fill the tanks back up. I also felt like the supercharged Boss weapons you get were weak or useless not very handy at all in this game compared to MMX1 or X2.<br /><br />Mega Man games are held to a higher standard because they have been so good for so long.  Even though this only the 3rd game in the X series both X1 and X2 were great games with a high replay value.  After finally completing this game I had no real desire to play it again.  As with all Mega Man games the play control is very good and you can dash up in this game, but besides that new feature this game is nothing towrite home about. I felt the game was just missing that fun element that the other 2 X games had. I have not played the Playstation version of the game but I hope it is much improved over this version.  Final verdict its an average game 3 stars at best.<br /><br />Gameplay: 6<br />Play Control: 8<br />Story/Originality: 5<br />Challenge: 10<br />Replay Value: 4	2015-08-19

Well with him being 6, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a steering wheel for him to use just in case it broke. I found this Gaming Steering Wheel from TNP Products and decided to try it. It hooks wonderfully onto my controller, and doesn't slide even when he has dropped it on the floor. It did take him a bit to get used to it, but now, he uses it really well.

I like it, except my issues with it were<br />a. the screwdrivers it came with were cheaply made. I had one strip out on me and become unusable half way through the project, but I had an extra that size on hand so it wasn't too big of a deal. Also it didn't come with any spudgers, which I guess aren't needed for the shell swap, but are nice to have.<br />b. it didn't come with two extra screws for reattaching the hinge. I managed to strip the hinge screws (triwing screwdrivers are great for stripping phillips heads) and was assuming I'd find the right sized screw in the little screw bag you get with the kit, but there wasn't one (you could argue that this point was from my stupidity/my doing, which I won't argue against)<br />c.  it might just be from the slightly different sized screws I got from my local hardware store to replace the stripped hinge screws, but the hinge doesn't quite hold the system closed like a ds lite with a factory case does(system with a closed case will let the screen flop partially open if you let it, where a ds lite with original, working nintendo hinge doesn't let you do that) , but it still clicks to its open position like a nintendo stock case does. Also the GBA game slot likes to scratch pieces of plastic off of cartridges inserted into it (thanks to that metal piece you can see in the thumbnail) but I have many GBA's that I use over the DS for playing gba games, so that's not too big of a deal, but something to remember.<br /><br />Overall, other then the cheap screwdrivers, most my issues with it can be traced back to me making various rookie mistakes that I feel I wouldn't make a second time and even with those issues/my inexperience with swapping shells, I've managed to get the system back together with a better hinge inside of it, and in perfect working order. I would recommend, especially if you either a. have experience taking apart electronics, or b. have a spare ds lite with a broken hinge or buttons and don't mind learning how to take one apart. Also one last thing, I used ifixit's guide on taking apart a ds lite over the guide that a sheet of paper links you to with the product.	2015-08-19

I always considered myself more of action/adventure and fantasy fan. Growing up, I was not very interested in Sci Fi franchises such as Star Wars, Star Trek, etc. Yes, I knew Star Wars, and yes, I did watch all movies and enjoyed them, but I preferred series such as Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones a lot more.<br />Until I played the Mass Effect trilogy.<br /><br />Not to give away any spoilers, the premise of the Mass Trilogy is a combination of most Sci Fi worlds out there. You have us, humans, who discover that we are not the only ones in the universe and that there is a big galactic universe made up of other alien species, as well a governing entity that rules over the galactic community. You play as Commander Shepard (either male of female) as you go through becoming a commander, commanding your own ship, discovering different worlds and planets all around the galaxy, building relationships with members of different races, you make decisions that have consequences, all of that as you prepare your self to fight and survive the eminent attack of an alien race called the Reapers.<br />The game gets you very involved in the story, setting, characters and all. The series made me appreciate Sci-Fi and I started eagerly watching Sci Fi series such as Battlestar Galactica, Stargate and I am about to start watching Star Trek. More over, I am more excited about the next game, Mass Effect Andromeda, a lot more than the new Tomb Raider game.	2015-08-19

US	35605055	R3RSVS6DXTAVYQ	B00IQCRKT8	575580052	Batman: Arkham Knight	Video Games	3	1	1	N	N	Knight In Degenerative Armor	With the constant saturation of superheroes in today’s culture, it’s fairly surprising how almost none of the overall appeal associated with them has translated well into the video game market over the past several years.  Aside from 2004’s Spider-Man 2 and a handful of other exceptions, practically every superhero video game released in conjunction with its respective film has ranged from subpar to downright pitiful in overall quality. This is exactly why the Batman Arkham series is so fresh and invigorating. I heavily enjoyed playing all three Arkham games prior to this installment, including the somewhat despised Arkham Origins game, because I found their stories immersive and their combat simplistic, yet intuitive and exciting.  I’ve never been a big fan of stealth sequences due to their overly simple and repetitive design – in the Call of Duty campaigns they’re serviceable enough because of their brevity – but in these games, they’re engaging and strategical, and allow the player to approach them in a variety of ways.  I was really looking forward to how Arkham Knight would cultivate these superb elements of the previous games while integrating the much-touted Batmobile, but unfortunately the game ended up disappointing me, both in its story as well as its overreliance on the Batmobile during the main story missions.  The opening of this game is very avant-garde as the player witnesses the Joker’s corpse being incinerated while old-fashioned music is audible in the background. The first gameplay sequence actually has the player take control of a police officer during Scarecrow’s initial hallucinogenic gas attack in a diner. These two events came across as unexpected to me, and gave me hope that the remainder of the story would continue to catch me off guard.  However, most of the story, particularly how the writers handled the villains in this game, proves to be quite problematic, as I will discuss in more detail in my spoiler section. The first handful of hours of the game provide a strong enough launchpad—albeit a bit too exposition-heavy—for the plot to propel forward.  The Scarecrow has publicly threatened the citizenry of Gotham, which in turn almost entirely evacuates itself from the city, and Batman must team up with Gordon in order to take him down. While the Scarecrow character here appears more menacing than he did in Arkham Asylum, he takes a backseat for almost the entire game and isn’t prominently featured until the final act.  Instead, much of the game’s narrative focus is on uncovering the secret identity of the mysterious Arkham Knight, an “original” character who was purportedly created specifically for this game. The writers completely mishandled this character throughout the story, and squander any opportunity of making him intriguing or threatening towards Batman by blatantly foreshadowing far too much information to the audience, so much so that I’d reckon most players will be apathetic or disappointed after discovering the Arkham Knight’s true identity.  The ending to Arkham City acted as an excellent bookend to the Arkham trilogy prior to this game, and ultimately, the story here feels superfluous and unneeded, and nothing in it really justifies its own existence besides the publishers simply wanting to make another Arkham game.  Thankfully, the core gameplay mechanics are as solid as ever.  Hand-to-hand combat is unaltered from the previous games, as it should be.  The combat mechanics are virtually flawless, so just because it doesn’t break any new ground doesn’t warrant fan complaints about there being a “lack of innovation,” an issue that’s arisen more and more frequently in recent years with the Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed franchises. Change for the sake of change (or broader market appeal) is inherently bad and generally doesn’t accomplish much except for the alienation of the core fan base. For what it’s worth, I’ll mention that twonew enemies have been added during the combat sequences to spice things up a bit, the first of which is an enemy who attempts to tackle Batman, and the second one being an electrically-armored foe who is temporarily invulnerable to Batman’s attacks. Aside from this, though, there’s nothing more to say about these sequences besides the fact that they’re as fluid, free-flowing, and hard-hitting as they’ve ever been in this franchise.  The stealth sequences/predatory roams now take place in locales that are for the most part more open-ended and larger than those that came before, thus allowing the player more freedom to approach them. The most notable addition is the ability to perform what the game refers to as “multi fear takedowns,” which allow you to easily surprise and dispatch of several enemies in a rapid succession without taking any damage. While these maneuvers are enjoyable enough to execute, they make the act of being stealthy a tad bit too easy. Regardless, these stealth encounters are still the best I’ve ever played before in a video game.  Where the game falters in overall enjoyment is in the segments in which the player is forced to use the Batmobile for extended periods of time.  The Batmobile/Bat-Tank is divided into two separate modes, the first of which is the act of simply driving around Gotham. The default control scheme for the vehicle is cumbersome and counterintuitive to every driving game you’ve ever played prior to this. Thankfully, there’s an option to resort to using a secondary, more recognizable setup for the vehicle, but the catch is that that option isn’t explicitly presented in the options menu. So while this problem is technically fixable, I’d wager that many players still be stuck using the default scheme just based upon how muddled the process of altering it is.  Assuming you actually get around to using the secondary scheme, driving around the city can be quite enjoyable, but it still leaves a bit to be desired.  Many of the streets in Gotham feel a bit too narrow for the Batmobile, so you’ll often collide against the side of buildings whenever you turn onto another street, and there are few streets that allow the Batmobile to accelerate to its top speed for more than a couple of seconds.  Gliding around the city and using your grappling hook is still a far more preferable method to traverse the urban landscape, especially since Batman can now select his next grappling target while still being reeled in on his hook, allowing for a more fast-paced, instantaneous travel experience. While I appreciate how this addition makes traveling more efficient, it takes away a lot of the skill required to hone the grappling hook in Arkham City, where accuracy and timing were more predominant.  The vehicle’s other mode transforms it into a tank that you use to engage unmanned, remote-controlled drones.  Most of these encounters boil down to shooting at enemy drones while constantly dodging their line of fire by quickly thrusting left or right. Continually obliterating these enemy drones progressively builds up a meter in the corner of the screen, which, once filled, allows your tank to unleash a barrage of missiles upon your enemies. Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong or broken with these tank battles, but they lack any real opportunities to approach them in different ways like the aforementioned sequences, both of which have had three games to be refined to perfection. Many of its sections in the game require you to sneak around behind a beefed-up tank and hit it in its weak spot, drive away, and then repeat the same attack. I firmly believe that the Batmobile should've been relegated as a transportation option only, or perhaps having side missions devoted to it, but certainly not mandatory for around 40% of main story missions. If the developers so desperately wanted it to be included in the primary missions, then those missions should’ve been open-ended to the point whereplayer can complete them in several different ways.  The other major issue I have with this game in terms of its game design is the absence of any substantial boss fights. Granted, there is one exception that takes place around halfway through the game, where Batman fights alongside Robin to defeat a formidable, muscle-bound African-American boxer. The fight sequence is one of the few highlights of the game because it takes advantage of the best aspects of the series. However, as good as the fight is, it doesn’t suffice when it lasts for ten minutes at most and it takes roughly 15 hours to complete the game. Almost every other boss fight in the game is vehicular, involving the same repetitive techniques you employ during each tank fight. This problem wouldn’t upset me so much if the boss fights in the previous games hadn’t been so excellent.  The game even rubs salt in the wound by featuring Deathstroke, with whom Batman had engaged in a momentous clash in Arkham Origins, only to have him fight Batman in yet another generic tank battle before getting his lights punched out instantly as soon as he steps foot outside his tank.  There are a bevy of side missions at your disposal, most of which I haven’t bothered to delve into just yet. I attempted to complete a few Riddler challenges, which, to my knowledge, only consist of driving the Batmobile around underground racetracks, which grew tiresome very quickly. Perhaps I’ll return to complete all of the side activities eventually, but from what I’ve experienced of them so far, they’re comparable to those featured in Arkham City.  The audiovisual presentation in this game is phenomenal on all fronts.  The Arkham games have always excelled in this department, but this game outclasses them by having better lighting, smoother animations, and far more activity occurring on screen at once.  This game joins, and even surpasses in some aspects, the ranks of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Far Cry 4 as being one of the best-looking games ever made.  In terms of sound, everything you hear during gameplay is fine, and the voice acting for the most part is good. I was disappointed in the Arkham Knight’s voice because it made him appear less intelligent and too whiney, and Kevin Conroy at times sounds uninspired during certain scenes, lacking inflection and conviction in his voice.  I know that a lot of people feel nothing but contempt for Arkham Origins, but for me, this is by far the worst game of this now four-part series. While the game is gorgeous to behold, and its hand-to-hand and predatory segments are mechanically flawless, many of the villains and ideas in the story are mishandled, the tank combat is lackluster, and there are hardly any worthwhile boss encounters.  Don’t get me wrong, this is still a solid enough game, (although I wouldn’t recommend paying full price for it) but it’s ultimately just extremely disappointing to me as a follow-up to Arkham City, which I still consider to be one of the best games I’ve ever played.	2015-08-19

I liked that it chose a darker story line than most previous titles, but the game seemed very short, and like the story didn't flow all that well.<br /><br />I know that this came out the same time as Assassin's Creed Unity for the new console generation, so I can only assume that this game received secondary treatment for that reason.<br /><br />That being said, it is still a fun game that's significantly better than Assassin's Creed III, but falls just a bit short.  It's definitely worth playing if you're a fan of the series, and early mid 18th century history.	2015-08-19

My grandson takes after his Grandma and loves anything and everything about Disney.

What the heck were those developers thinking when making these two games. Too many frustrations with these 2. Don't waste your money on these.

I refuse to finish ACB, because you can't use any weapon, but the apple, and the apple is a not a good weapon in this one. So hard to kill here with the apple. I enjoyed AC3 and on much, so I decided to play AC2 and ACB.. what a major disappointment and frustration. In AC2 and ACB, there are too many desych from short time allowed for mission, poor handling and control and many of the sequences/missions are not enjoyable. I'm glad they got it right and better with AC Unity, but these 2 games are bad!	2015-08-19

To anyone who is hesitant to purchase due to the lack of the Nintendo label, I assure you this is a perfect substitute. Many gamers get fastidious when it comes to products like these, and I understand that because I am one of them. However, I took a chance on this much cheaper and adequately supplied brand, and I couldn't be happier. My good friend has the Nintendo made adapter, which I have used numerous times, and this one operates identically. Nintendo uses basic economic concepts, restricting supply to fuel a continuous demand, in order to sell more products at a marginally higher price (ex: amibos are nearly impossible to find, people willingly empty their wallets when they find them). In most situations, it is a good business tactic, and we as consumers cannot avoid the situation because we want what they have. However, this is a product that should be readily available, and now it is thanks to Mayflash. Buy this!	2015-08-19

Most all my apps and favorite games arent on here which is annoying.  And then tonight, it decided it will not boot or connect to my PC to be reset.  So I have a $300 fancy paperweight while I wait for my RMA number to be provided.  Customer support was friendly enough, but what I want is a fast replacement.  Update (+1 more star) - Customer service did a fantastic job.  I see a few complains here, but they could not have done better for me.  There were lots of questions and things to try, but after 24 hours they sent me a new one via fedex overnight, so I had minimal downtime.  I still think they should use native android.  I like my shield tablet a lot better than this, but it definitely has potential.	2015-08-19

So my decal just came in today and I have to say, I'm not satisfied with this resolution on the decal. ESPECIALLY when the one advertised looks WAY better.

I haven't even bothered opening it from the see through plastic sleeve it came in. Nice to look at from afar but not up close.	2015-08-19

I got this stand for a friend of mine who has an 8 year old that has a Playstation 4 in his room.  The concern that she always has with him is that he is going to try and move the Playstation around and then of course it will get damaged.  Now that he has this stand, he knows it has a specific place that it belongs and it doesn't go anywhere but on the stand.  Of course the added benefit is that it keeps the Playstation cool , so no worries that it is going to overheat and will of course lengthen the life of the gaming station.  It has spots on either side of where your gaming station goes to be able to set your controllers and charge them while they are sitting in their designated spots. No more worries of grabbing a controller and it is dead.  There is nothing more frustrating than going to play your gaming system and you can't because the controllers are dead.  There is really nothing to the set up on this.  You literally just set it up , put your Playstation on it and place your controllers on it  Easy Peasy!!  Please know that everything that I have written about this product is how I really feel about it and you can read my reviews with confidence.  I received this product at a discount  in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.	2015-08-19

I use my DS4 for everything I can, PS4 gaming and PC gaming. Its just the best controller. But the build quality on the OEM trigger buttons isn't the best, and i found my R2 button sticking slightly. This replacement worked perfectly, opening the DS4 is (kinda) a breeze. Ergonomically, the replacement is identical. 100% fit. Visually it is a 98% match, and it only loses 2% because the plastic doesn't sheen in the light EXACTLY as the original L2 button does. But you have to look pretty hard to notice. I also liked it cuz I was able to both save the cost of a new controller, and easily add some metal XBOX One thumbsticks to my controller since the PS4 rubber ones suck and also break. Also for a low price I have more replacements, if the button breaks again or a friends. Good buy.	2015-08-19

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose!	I've had this mouse for about 4 months now and I have used it everyday for several hours at a time. I liked a lot of things about this mouse but it has a few flaws/defects that have caused me to replace this mouse with a more expensive brand gaming mouse. I've used this mouse for mostly gaming and internet browsing. The types of games I've played are FPS's, strategy, MMO and RPG type games.<br /><br />First, I'd like to go over a few things that I liked about the mouse. It feels great, even though I have smallish hands. The two side buttons are crisp and easy to press. It slides smoothly on my mouse pad. I have not had any issues with phantom clicks or releases. The lights on the mouse are pretty subtle compared to some other brands, which is nice. It's a pretty good deal for the price.<br /><br />The &#34;deal breaking&#34; issue for me is that my mouse came with a defective mouse wheel. The mouse wheel is hard to spin because it rubs up against the left side of the wheel housing. As you can see in my picture, the mouse wheel is not centered in the wheel housing. It came out of the box this way. Also, the middle mouse button sometimes does not work and I have to spin the mouse wheel one or two full rotations before it will work. For me, this defect makes this mouse very difficult to use for gaming and browsing the web. I use the mouse wheel a lot for key binds and camera control (depending on the game) and I have tried to power though it, change my gameplay style to work around the defect. In the end, it was just not working out and I purchased another brand/type of mouse to match my gaming preferences.<br /><br />Another issue I've had is the optic sensor does not seem to be one of quality. I've had a lot of issues with precision. When I try to move my mouse a tiny amount, the pointer jumps all over the place. This is not an issue of too much mouse sensitivity. When I move the mouse pointer slowly straight down, the pointer is jumping wildly to the left and right.For example, some video players have very tiny video controls, and I have a hard time turning down the volume or pausing /playing the video due to the pointer jumping around.<br /><br />To be honest if it weren't for the mouse wheel issue, I would have given this product four stars. I feel like when you buy a cheaper product like this, you're kinda rolling the dice on what you will get. Sometimes you luck out and get a great product with no defects and you get your moneys worth. Other times, like with what happened to me, you get a lemon. It's up to you to decide if it is worth your time and money to gamble on the quality this product. Thank you for reading!	2015-08-19

I had previously tried using the Grip-iT Analog Stick Covers with less then stellar results as those while working on a limited scale were also very flimsy and nor that great when playing games. These while a little more pricey then the previous thumb grips have a little more feeling of durability and a lot more comfort and grip when I played my video games. The thumb grip geltabz fit securely on the PS4 controller as well as the Xbox One controller with no fear of them slipping off during the more action filled games you might be playing and are thumbing the controller sticks every which way.<br /><br />So for any game console owner looking for decent thumb grips be sure to give these a try.	2015-08-19

It's a timeless classic for families that like to gather around and pull out a physical non-electronic game to play with each other. Should you decide to play Monopoly on a video game device, however, various companies have been willing to oblige for decades now, as there still continue to be video game versions of the board games to this very day. This Game Boy Color cartridge is one of those many versions released over time.<br /><br />This particular take on Monopoly is actually the same thing as the original Game Boy version of Monopoly, which in itself was a handheld port of the conversion on the NES. This time, Monopoly on the go has its own brand of color, but that's really the only difference, which is nice and actually underwhelming at the same time. I've played the NES version of Monopoly, and after having experienced this portable counterpart, I realized that there are actually several sound effects and jingles missing. No jingle plays when accessing a menu or hitting a Chance/Community Chest card, and the house-building is practically devoid of anything eventful-sounding.<br /><br />That isn't to say this isn't fun. After all, this is Monopoly we're talking about, and these oldschool takes on the game do function like Monopoly should; everything gameplay-wise is there and accounted for. You buy properties, build houses, go around the board and land on spaces, etc; it's indeed Monopoly as anyone that's played the game knows it. That is, unless you've always played with House Rules, which this game lacks; you're going to have to auction off properties you don't want to buy, and there's no money pot for Free Parking. Other than that, if you've had fun with playing the actual board game, you'll have fun with this. It's the same game as the real thing, just squeezed into a small cartridge, which is definitely great for not having to keep track of paper play money. You can even play with friends and family simply by sharing your Game Boy!ven play with friends and family simply by sharing your Game Boy!	2015-08-19

It's a fairly minor issue, so I would have felt bad asking them to send a new one because of it.  For those who are thinking of purchasing this item, this product is a nice, light-weight wooden board with approximately 2&#34; holes bored into it deep enough for your Amiibo's to fit into comfortably. They do wiggle ever so slightly, but I feel they fit well enough where they aren't likely to fall out, but aren't so tightly squeezed in that you could scratch the bases of your Amiibos in order to pull them out. The base is then throughly coated in a matte black paint, and then has a thicker red/green/blue paint blotches added on which is my (and probably everyone else's) favorite part. It also comes with 4 felt pads you can place on the bottom of the stand so that it doesn't scratch up the table, which is a very nice thought from the seller. It's a pretty nice stand overall though, and if you want to showcase off your Splatoon Amiibos then this is something worth considering.  With all of that being said, there was 1 main issue that I had with this product that may not bother others as much as it did me (I'm just a stickler for details). After the 2&#34; diameter holes are bored into the stand, it doesn't seem like the hole was sanded down at all, leaving a rough finish inside of the hole, most notably at the very bottom of the holes (the sides weren't as bad on mine). After paying an arm and a leg for my Amiibo, I didn't want the bases to get scratched up, so I searched around for something to place at the bottom of the base that would protect them from the rough finish, and I came across this: [[ASIN:B00HZ9YWWG Shepherd Hardware 9971 2-Inch Surface Grip Adhesive Non Slip Pads, 8-Pack]]  This self-adhesive, anti-skid pads are add-on items that cost less than $2, and they are thin enough so they didn't push my Amiibo out of the stand, but added protective padding to the base of the holes. The pads fit in without a problem and had barely any distance between the edge of the pads and the inner hole's walls. The only down side is you only need 3 of the 8 that it comes with, but for less than $2, I'm not going to gripe much about the extra 5 pads that I didn't necessarily need.  While it's possible my order was a rare case that had a missed step in production, others may not need the adhesive pads, but if anyone does happen to have this issue, I wanted to at least give the solution that I found. I wish I could add photos to this, but unfortunately I already put the pads on the base of the stand. Anyways, I hope this helped those who read my lengthy review, but happy buying all!  ---------------------------------------------[Updated 8/31/15]-------------------------------------------  4 Star to 5 Star Review  I just received the felt patches in the mail today, and was pleasantly surprised to see them. I wasn't aware until I saw Toyplicity's response to my review, but I'm very happy to hear they heard my concern and started including the 3 felt patches to be put in place at the bottom of their Amiibo stands. Each color matches the different colors of the Inkling boy/girl/squid, and while they aren't visible when the Amiibo are in the holder itself, it shows their attention to detail (since they sent 3 separate colors instead of 3 felt patches of the same color) and it provides the scratch protection that I had concerns about originally.To Toyplicity, thank you for listening to your customers' concerns, and to everyone else, happy buying!	2015-08-19

It pains me to write a review that doesn't give this headset a full five stars.<br /><br />I received this item from Amazon just yesterday and spent the majority of an evening setting it up and adjusting any/all settings.I will say these headphones are well packaged and you can see the quality of the product/company. It felt like a real studio headset when picking it up for the first time and placing them on my head. The earphones are very comfortable and felt amazing to my ears. Setting up the unit was pretty easy (Just make sure you have the mute cord closer to your body). I immediately booted up Spotify to hear some tunes and I was very impressed with the clarity of this set... until... a slow popping noise became apparent. It was in my left ear and it seemed to be on a loop every 10 seconds or so. I googled this and looked for potential solutions and troubleshooted everything possible. I resorted to switching out sound cards (SB Titanium to Sound Blaster Z) which seemed to work. If I didn't have an extra sound card to try out, I would've been out of luck. (Strike 1)<br /><br />With the electric clicking now gone, I resumed listening to all types of music. I wanted to hear a variety of genres to ensure I heard exactly what this headset had to offer. Although it wasn't a punchy as my G35's, they sounded much better and clearer than previous headsets. Being a gamer I then exposed this headset to the true test... Battlefield 4. Although the sound seemed very clear, this is where the headphones started to dwindle for me. I immediately plugged in my Logitech's to get a real life comparison of the difference between the two and I was startled. My G35's blew the Astro's away because of the boom factor for me. Not good... (Strike 2)<br /><br />After playing a game or two, I decided to check out how the mic sounded with the A40's. I cannot tell you how lousy and tough it was to actually get them to work with Teamspeak. I had a brother, who owns his own TS server, assisting and he could've figure it out either. Without the mic, the headset was literally useless to me. I spent at least two hours trying to configure, reconfigure and google any possible fixes and ended up with nothing. (Strike 3)<br /><br />Just when I got ready to turn my computer off... the electric click came back... contacted Amazon and opened a return ticket. I'll be sticking with my Logitech g35's. The a40's look amazing and sound pretty darn good, but for a price tag of $250 I was expecting a LOT more.	2015-08-19

I use them all the time and have only had to charge them twice in the two months I've had them. Do yourself a favor and get some of these. The wiimotes don't cut it.	2015-08-19

I quit years ago after chugging away for about 5 years without much progress.  After only 10-12 days of gameplay, I already have callus fingertips and find myself picking and moving along the fret-board without looking.  Too bad I didn't have something like this a long time ago.  It also helps immensely if you have trouble with rhythm (Like me).  I find myself understanding the concept of rhythm and syncopation much better, so far.<br /><br />CONS:  Sometimes I think that the game tries to progress too fast, before you really have a grasp on the easier levels.  - The user interface takes some time to understand, but is fine afterwards ( I should add that I've never played Guitar Hero, maybe it's intuitive for those people?) -  Also, the riff-repeater is a bit cumbersome.  I wish there was a way to learn complex solos, etc, at a slower speed by default.	2015-08-19

Exactly what I needed for my Turtle Beach x41 headset on my Xbox One.<br /><br />The Good: Super lightweight, no installation required. More controls than the stock adapater, allowing you to tune between gaming and voice, and audio up/down, and a big friendly mute button. Solidly made, to my surprise; it's plastic but it feels very durable.<br /><br />The Bad: The extra controls are nice, but I'm not all that sure they work well with non-standard headsets. Might be a personal issue; the x41s are older headsets. But the Xbox insists on passing full audio through the controller, which is kind of pointless because I get full audio over the headset transmitter. Having an override would be nice so I don't end up having to turn various settings on and off and back into the 'right' way to do it.<br /><br />Improvement: A switch to turn off controller audio, or even better, control if audio, chat, both, or neither goes through the controller.<br /><br />TL;DR: Need an adapter? this is it. Risk a knockoff if you like, but this sucker /works/.	2015-08-19

In my opinion the A40 falls somewhere between TB and SS for both comfortability and audio quality. As far as microphones go, the A40 is the best of the bunch. The build and design quality are where the A40 accells. I'm very confident the design accounts for the majority of the overall manufacturing cost.<br /><br />I would recommend this headset to working adults who are looking for a good introduction headset and prioritize convenience and aesthetics over audio quality and comfort. However if you already own a microphone or don't mind shelling out for a desktop, clip-on or ModMic then save your beans and get a real set of headphones from Audio Technica, Beyerdynamic, Sennheiser, Grado or AKG.	2015-08-19

Seeking to save at least some of the population of the doomed planet, the goddess Althenia used her powers to bring the survivors to a new world where she used  the last of her energy to transform the barren wasteland into a vibrant world where the sins of the past could be avoided.  To ensure that peace reigned four beings, known as dragons, were given power over the forces of light, dark, fire and water.<br /><br />Their avatar in this world was known as the Dragon Master. She then retired to the goddess tower where she sleeps until she is needed again.  Whenever the balance of the world was threatened brave men and women would set out to complete the dragons trials and earn the power necessary to deal with the threat.  This cycle continued for thousands of years until the last Dragon Master, Dyne, perished under mysterious circumstances.  The evil that threatened the world was defeated, but for the first time in memory there was no Dragon Master to maintain balance in the world.  The world was left to deal with it's problems on it's own. The dragons were silent.  It didn't take long for some to forget what the silent, silver reminder in the sky warned against.<br /><br />The Story(Some Story Details):<br /><br />The story begins in the remote town of Burg, fifteen years after the death of Dragon Master Dyne.  An ancient evil has begun to stir on what as known as the frontier, a barren land that is beyond the reach of the Goddesses Althena's power.  While rumors swirl of the return of the “Magic Emperor”, a title associated with anyone who unites the monsters of the frontier, they are just rumors without any proof. While some of these stories have reached the remote island town of Burg, they are far away and more the problem of the magic guild which is located on the main land.<br /><br />More popular are the stories of the legendaryDragon Master Dyne and his companions.  Though most consider the stories to be a exaggeration of actual events, this doesn't matter to a young man by the name of Alex.  He dreams of becoming the next Dragon Master and  going on grand adventures to thwart evil where ever it may be.  One day he gets his chance when exploring the nearby White Dragon Cave.  In a flash of light the White Dragon appears and grants Alex the Dragon Ring, the first relic needed on the journey to become the Dragon Master.<br /><br />Soon Alex sets out on a journey to find the remaining Dragons and assume the role of Dragon Master. With him are his childhood friends ,Ramus, Luna, and his flying cat Nall. Their first stop is the magic guild, where they soon find that their journey might not be as simple as they thought...<br /><br />Conclusion(My Overall Opinion on the Story):<br />I played this game when it first came out years ago.  It was one of my favorite RPG's of the time and even though the graphics have been updated and a few things removed, like that awesome original opening song, it's still the engaging story I played all those years ago.  There are several new scenes that have been added to flesh out the story and there are various game play tweaks that make the game a little more streamlined for modern times.  In this version you can save anywhere, the graphics have been updated, the combat system has been streamlined with tactics that can be customized and probably a few more features that I am missing.<br /><br />The only downside to this game is that the combat hasn't aged that well.  The combat is your standard turn based fair where you select an attack for each character and then they do said attack and then the enemy takes it's turn and does the same.  While I don't like overly complicated battle systems, there isn't much need to think about tactics in this game, except for a couple of battles. This is helped a little by the fact enemies are visible on the map and, can occasionally, be avoided but there is still a lot of battles where it boils down to pick your area spell of choice and repeat two or three times till the battle is over and then repeat.<br /><br />The good thing though is that the story and the characters hold up even though it is your standard boy saves the world and gets the girl story.  So if your looking for a classic rpg to sink some time into give this one a shot. m.a.c	2015-08-19

US	52541364	R379LKZSA2PFOZ	B00YY3P4RI	863214736	SteelSeries Siberia P300 Comfortable Gaming Headset for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3	Video Games	4	1	2	Y	N	Solid Headphones For The Money	The P300 is a solid performer for the money.  I have some other very nice headphones that I use, namely the Turtle Beach XP510, and the Polk 4-Shot.  Sound-wise, I don't think the P300 quite measures up.  For one thing, with the volume cranked all the way up, it's only moderately loud.  The sound dynamics overall, don't sound quite as good as the XP510 or 4-Shot, but they are less expensive headphones, so that is to be expected.<br /><br />Using them with the PS4 works like a charm, and couldn't be simpler.  Just plug them into the controller, the PS4 immediately recognizes them, and reconfigures the system to output to the headphones and also take mic audio from them as well.  Very nice!<br /><br />They like to promote the P300 Comfort factor.  To me they are overselling that a bit.  Yes, they are comfortable, but really not any more so than other quality headphones.<br /><br />Overall the P300's are nice, quality headphones at a fair price.  If you spend more, you will notice a difference in sound, but they sound perfectly fine.  About the only thing I have misgivings about with the P300 is the overall build quality.  When you hold the headphones, and examine them, it is quickly apparent that you are holding a pretty cheaply made, flimsy, insubstantial piece of plastic, so I definitely have some concerns about them holding up to hard use.  If you take care of them though... they should be fine.  Give em a try!  You could do a lot worse.	2015-08-19

But it's something I would recommend using while your playing and not leaving it on all the time. So only 4 stars.	2015-08-19

These extenders look great which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars not 1.<br />There is just no functionality in these. They prevent the buttons from retracting fully that is, they are always slightly pressed. Also if you even apply a little pressure on them, which is very common in the heat of the moment, the extendors come off.<br />I really wanted to like these coz they look so awesome. I hope they come out with a newer model that actually works.	2015-08-19

I can understand why some people are giving this one or two stars. I plugged it in and was set to play Formula 1 2015 when I realized the pedals didn't work, nor the steering. So, I thought &#34; hey, maybe I will try it on the forza games since that is what it was advertised for.&#34; Luckily I had forza 2 horizon, so like that was the game which allowed me to connect to my xbox one. So then I went back to F1, and viola! everything is fine now. I also am glad I purchased a racing stand, as this you cannot simply place on your lap and go. The steering is way too tight, so you cannot turn without flipping the racing wheel over. All in all, I am happy, however, but I can understand others. *****update***** after having this wheel for a couple of weeks, I find that you have to start your xbox up with the wheel. That will program it. If you start your xbox one with the controller and then try using it, it won't program. So that is probably most of the complaints right there. This wheel is awesome, and once the wheel is programmed, then you can go to say, F1, and adjust the racing wheel settings. hope this helps! See you on the race track!	2015-08-19

My Wife and I picked this up the other day and so far it has been pretty fun. The normal Monopoly games can be long, but that's just how Monopoly is. However I have seen other reviews complain that you can't skip the animation sequences for when your pieces move on the board etc. But this has now been patched and you can skip the animation sequences. The only thing that kind of messed up the experience was that the computer players on normal difficulty would accept almost any trade we proposed to them.<br /><br />Monopoly Deal is a very fun card game that we play with friends all of the time, so we were excited to play this on the PS4. However, you can't play with other people, just computer players or people online. However for all Monopoly modes there was no one online playing unfortunately.<br /><br />But overall this will give you your Monopoly fix and at the time that I purchased the game, it was only $18 bucks.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Nice presentation<br />-Multiple game modes and ways to change the rules<br />-Includes Monopoly Deal<br />-Supports a good amount of players<br />-Only one controller is needed<br />-Lots of things to unlock if you want to build your own custom Monopoly boards<br />-They have patched the game so you can skip animation sequences<br />-Only $18 bucks<br /><br />CONS<br />-Hardly anyone playing classic Monopoly or Monopoly Deal online<br />-Computer players on normal difficulty accept stupid trades<br />-The text on the Monopoly Deal cards looks really pixelated<br />-Can't play Monopoly Deal with others. Only computer players and people online, but there is hardly anyone online.	2015-08-19

As long as you have enough room for the camera to see you and your friends, its a ton of fun. My kids can play for hours but I found that the adults love to come down and show off our NON skills, but hey, after a while we can actually get some of the moves perfect. I practiced a song for a couple weeks without my son knowing and then when he was playing and chose that song, I said &#34;hey, I like that song, Ill dance to this one&#34;.

Also bought the WII U 2.0 Toybox starter pack (base and 2 figures) and the matching sidekicks figures to go with these.  That, along with the free download of Infinity 1.0 WII U on the Nintendo eShop, allows my kids to play co-op on the Infinity 1.0 levels (Pirates, Monsters U and Incredibles).  And of course co-op on the 1.0 or 2.0 Toybox.  All of that for around 50 bucks total.  Can't beat the value!<br /><br />As for the 3DS game itself, haven't even tried it.  Probably terrible based on other reviews.  But for 10 bucks shipped it's worth it just to get the 3 figures if you're buying Infinity to use on other systems like I did.	2015-08-19

Game only has 8 courses, And doesn't have 2 majors! Not worth the price I paid for this game. Game looks really nice, and with no load times between shots makes the game quick and fun.

You'll either arrive at your destination or your 3DS will die (assuming you aren't able to charge during your travels: some people can) from low battery.<br /><br />Comes with a slot to store one stylus, and of course a big open storage area for your New 3DS/3DS XL. As I have literally just received this a few hours ago, I haven't actually needed to use it for travelling yet, but I've been messing around with the case, filling it up with all my New 3DS goodies and it works like a charm.

I've platinumed every single game, including Festival of blood, and I felt the previous games had something fairly unique to offer.<br /><br />This game, however, does not. If you're expecting time traveling future versions of yourself, a wide array of combat mechanics, or a more nuanced karma system, this game will not satisfy you. The story is more along the lines of an X-Men knock off, the main character is a smart mouthed, flashy character with powers that basically equate to flashy lights, fog machine, and holograms, and he does funky graffiti. The side quest vary little, and repeat far too often. The game is fairly quick to complete, and I 100 percented my first playthrough in about 14 hours.<br /><br />So why does it have 4 stars? Well, even though it doesn't quite have the level of depth the prior games have, this game was FUN! Zipping around the city at high speeds leaving a streak of light behind you, attacking enemies with smoke bombs, and bombarding goons with video projections is good fun. The game handles well, and utilizes the touch pad, motion controls, and the speaker on the controller quite well. It's a great game to test the new PS4 hardware on. The game also looks beautiful, and it fully showcases what the PS4 is capable of from a graphical standpoint as well.<br /><br />Overall, this game feels like a summer blockbuster. Flashy and a lot of fun, but don't expect a ton of depth or rich narrative.	2015-08-19

In all honesty, this game would have benefited from being single player.  The fact that there are people all around you doing the same thing you are cheapens the feeling that you're actually doing something that affects the world. I'm being praised for killing a vicious beast, but I turn around to make sure I've gotten all the loot before I leave, and I see that it has respawned. It's just makes everything I'm doing seem pointless. The dungeons are just straight shots with very little--if anything--to explore. In Skyrim and Oblivion, I could spend more than an hour in each dungeon going over every little crack and crevice, making sure I've picked up everything worth taking and just enjoying how well designed they were; they were much more fun when I was taking my time to get through them. The game is beautiful, yes, but honestly, that's about all it has going for it. Don't get me wrong, the game is fine, and I like mmos (like Neverwinter, it's free to play on the xbone, it's great) it just isn't very immersive, which is something you need for a true Elder Scrolls game. But that's because Bethesda wasn't the one to develop it. In short, unless you really like mmos, I'd skip this and wait for ES6, it's about time for them to announce the next one.	2015-08-19

The PS4 ones are shorter and wider while the XBOX ONE ones are taller and thinner (you can tell by comparing pictures).  These green ones here are advertised as PS4 thumbsticks but the ones I received are the taller, thinner XBOX ONE thumbsticks.  Now I've used regular stock XBOX ONE thumbsticks in my PS4 controller before and they work fine; the increased height means you have more leverage and the thumbstick is easier to move around.  However, the metal version of the XBOX ONE thumbsticks are a LOT more sensitive in a PS4 controller.  Sniping in Planetside 2 is made very difficult and (if you're standing still) you can be applying almost no pressure to the stick and it will move you all over the place.  I don't know if someone at E-MODS is mixing up the orders but in the reviews for the PS4 DARK GREY THUMBSTICKS a few guys posted pictures of the ones they installed and they were XBOX ONE thumbsticks.  Either they didn't notice or it didn't bother them but it just shows that this item isn't the only one getting mixed up.  Be that as it may, they still work.  Just like everyone says they do feel a bit slippery but you get used to them.	2015-08-19
US	53090127	RAYDGQQM7TI37	B00VJ3AECQ	394160851	Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare	Video Games	4	6	8	N	Y	Playable and fun!	In my many years away from computer games, I'd somehow missed the rise of the Call of Duty series. A victim of Amazon's &#34;Prime Day&#34;, I dutifully bought a copy of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare when it appeared to be really cheap. The series has a reputation for having short single-player campaigns, but at half-price, I figured I could resell the disk if I didn't enjoy the multiplayer. (I expect not to play the multi-player game as I'd probably get slaughtered, and as someone who frequently gets interrupted in the middle of a game, I'd probably annoy all the other players by having to bail in the middle of a session)<br /><br />I will say that I'm impressed. Much like Killzone 3, it's a surprisingly fun and linear first person shooter. But the difficulty setting (especially at &#34;easy&#34;) is such that even I could play it through. What's particularly fun is that much as you could imagine it would be, you don't have to kill every enemy while progressing through a level to proceed. The game will proceed anyway if you simply charge forward. In the case of several of the set pieces, the game runs as though it were a Disneyland ride, rolling along at a breakneck pace while you do your best to nail as many enemies as possible, dodge obstacles, or simply keep up.<br /><br />And just as with the Uncharted series or Killzone, you're never alone: you always have an NPC to guide you. This serves two purposes: in many cases, the NPC's there to tell you where you go. Secondly, the NPC serves as a marker, following you in case of assault, and even occasionally giving you a chance to assist. Unlike certain other games, the NPCs never nag at you, and only occasionally give you orders.<br /><br />The story is thin, an excuseveneer to have fun. But boy, not having played one of these before, they're incredibly fun. Each segment of the single player campaign is unique, with set pieces that are never repeated in others. Whether it's night vision goggles, mute charges, or some new high tech warfare gadget, you're never given a chance to get sick and tired of the &#34;oh wow&#34; high tech special effects. The price of this of course, is player agency: you get one chance to drive the giant robot, one chance to drive a tank, one chance to drive the hoverbike, but you will never find one to hop on and use where the game designers have not placed it front and center (and an unavoidable part of the story). Nevertheless, when you do get the chance, you'll get a grin on your face and enjoy the heck out of it, because the entire set-piece is designed around the capabilities of your new toy. If this is part of the formula of the Call of Duty series, I can see why people line up for a chance to throw $60 every year to take part in the franchise: it's a heck of a lot more fun than most movies.<br /><br />Technically, the game's a masterpiece as well. There's slight stuttering in scenes where you're in close quarters with your comrades, but never in combat. Once you're in combat, the game runs (on my PS4 at least) at a full 60fps, and looks gorgeous. The cut-scenes look like they're from a high-budget Hollywood action movie, and the in-game graphics aren't a lot worse. The set pieces have a few annoying QTEs, but no worse than any of the Uncharted games.<br /><br />I will admit that I bought Wolfenstein: The New Order at half the price I paid for this, but even on the easiest difficulty level I'd get stuck. By contrast, Call of Duty was compellingly playable, had a much lighter story, and I never cared that I didn't find a single piece of Intel that was supposedly scattered throughout the levels of the single-player game: I got too engrossed and caught up in the situation presented, and never gave a thought to rooting around for hidden rewards when I could be off in another fire-fight with my squad-mates.<br /><br />That speaks volumes as to how playable and how much fun the latest Call of Duty installment is. Wolfenstein, by the way, got much better reviews (and is a dedicated single player game to boot), but I suspect you'd have to be much more jaded (and competent) a FPS player than I am to pass up Call of Duty over the Wolfenstein series.<br /><br />Recommended.	2015-08-19

After being won over by Titanfall previews I decided to get this bundle instead. I'll start with the game, then the console and how it compares to my PS4 that I just bought:<br /><br />Titanfall: A fun new concept for an online shooter which bypasses a tradition campaign to focus on the multiplayer only combat. The servers were never an issue for me (compared to Destiny, a Bungie loot grindfest with pretty graphics and a lobotomized story) and the graphics were good enough. It was fun for a while but eventually lost my interest due to the lack of story.<br /><br />Xbox One: This is a fantastic home theatre PC that can also play games! The kinetic is definitely worthwhile and allows for hands-free Hulu and Netflix watching. I am a longtime Halo fan and look forward to Halo 5 on this next gen console. The controller is a definite improvement over the Xbox 360. Microsoft is continually improving the Xbox OS and it will certainly see changes over the next few years that will only make it better (DirectX 12, cross platform gaming).<br /><br />Compared to PS4: Now that I own both consoles the difference is very clear. The PS4 has a better controller (more innovative features like the trackpad and built-in 3.5mm audio jack), far more powerful GPU (1152 stream processors vs Xbox 768, 6 more asymmetric compute units, 32 vs 16 ROPs, GDDR5 vs DDR3 RAM), smaller package with built in power supply. Why did Microsoft go with such a large form factor and not put in power brick inside the case? Ultimately these are both GAMING consoles, and if you prefer gaming for the PS4. I'll still dust of the Xbox One for the exclusives like Quantum Break and Halo 5.<br /><br />TL:DR<br />Xbox, why you bring so small a GPU and big power brick to console party?	2015-08-19

There are hidden collectibles, runes, and valuables throughout the level you can use, which you can use to power up your special abilities or sell to upgrade your gear. My favorite level was the brothel.<br /><br />This last paragraph, is LITERALLY a brief summary of Dishonored as well. Yes, that's right, it's interchangeable.<br /><br />That said, this game felt tedious, frustrating, and I honestly don't know who anyone was or what was going on, which aren't things I can say about Dishonored. The definitive edition is coming out for PS4 later this year, and that comes with a second campaign and challenge mode, in addition to the base game.

Aside from 2004’s Spider-Man 2 and a handful of other exceptions, practically every superhero video game released in conjunction with its respective film has ranged from subpar to downright pitiful in overall quality. This is exactly why the Batman Arkham series is so fresh and invigorating. I heavily enjoyed playing all three Arkham games prior to this installment, including the somewhat despised Arkham Origins game, because I found their stories immersive and their combat simplistic, yet intuitive and exciting.  I’ve never been a big fan of stealth sequences due to their overly simple and repetitive design – in the Call of Duty campaigns they’re serviceable enough because of their brevity – but in these games, they’re engaging and strategical, and allow the player to approach them in a variety of ways.  I was really looking forward to how Arkham Knight would cultivate these superb elements of the previous games while integrating the much-touted Batmobile, but unfortunately the game ended up disappointing me, both in its story as well as its overreliance on the Batmobile during the main story missions.  The opening of this game is very avant-garde as the player witnesses the Joker’s corpse being incinerated while old-fashioned music is audible in the background. The first gameplay sequence actually has the player take control of a police officer during Scarecrow’s initial hallucinogenic gas attack in a diner. These two events came across as unexpected to me, and gave me hope that the remainder of the story would continue to catch me off guard.  However, most of the story, particularly how the writers handled the villains in this game, proves to be quite problematic, as I will discuss in more detail in my spoiler section. The first handful of hours of the game provide a strong enough launchpad—albeit a bit too exposition-heavy—for the plot to propel forward.  The Scarecrow has publicly threatened the citizenry of Gotham, which in turn almost entirely evacuates itself from the city, and Batman must team up with Gordon in order to take him down. While the Scarecrow character here appears more menacing than he did in Arkham Asylum, he takes a backseat for almost the entire game and isn’t prominently featured until the final act.  Instead, much of the game’s narrative focus is on uncovering the secret identity of the mysterious Arkham Knight, an “original” character who was purportedly created specifically for this game. The writers completely mishandled this character throughout the story, and squander any opportunity of making him intriguing or threatening towards Batman by blatantly foreshadowing far too much information to the audience, so much so that I’d reckon most players will be apathetic or disappointed after discovering the Arkham Knight’s true identity.  The ending to Arkham City acted as an excellent bookend to the Arkham trilogy prior to this game, and ultimately, the story here feels superfluous and unneeded, and nothing in it really justifies its own existence besides the publishers simply wanting to make another Arkham game.  Thankfully, the core gameplay mechanics are as solid as ever.  Hand-to-hand combat is unaltered from the previous games, as it should be.  The combat mechanics are virtually flawless, so just because it doesn’t break any new ground doesn’t warrant fan complaints about there being a “lack of innovation,” an issue that’s arisen more and more frequently in recent years with the Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed franchises. Change for the sake of change (or broader market appeal) is inherently bad and generally doesn’t accomplish much except for the alienation of the core fan base. For what it’s worth, I’ll mention that twonew enemies have been added during the combat sequences to spice things up a bit, the first of which is an enemy who attempts to tackle Batman, and the second one being an electrically-armored foe who is temporarily invulnerable to Batman’s attacks. Aside from this, though, there’s nothing more to say about these sequences besides the fact that they’re as fluid, free-flowing, and hard-hitting as they’ve ever been in this franchise.  The stealth sequences/predatory roams now take place in locales that are for the most part more open-ended and larger than those that came before, thus allowing the player more freedom to approach them. The most notable addition is the ability to perform what the game refers to as “multi fear takedowns,” which allow you to easily surprise and dispatch of several enemies in a rapid succession without taking any damage. While these maneuvers are enjoyable enough to execute, they make the act of being stealthy a tad bit too easy. Regardless, these stealth encounters are still the best I’ve ever played before in a video game.  Where the game falters in overall enjoyment is in the segments in which the player is forced to use the Batmobile for extended periods of time.  The Batmobile/Bat-Tank is divided into two separate modes, the first of which is the act of simply driving around Gotham. The default control scheme for the vehicle is cumbersome and counterintuitive to every driving game you’ve ever played prior to this. Thankfully, there’s an option to resort to using a secondary, more recognizable setup for the vehicle, but the catch is that that option isn’t explicitly presented in the options menu. So while this problem is technically fixable, I’d wager that many players still be stuck using the default scheme just based upon how muddled the process of altering it is.  Assuming you actually get around to using the secondary scheme, driving around the city can be quite enjoyable, but it still leaves a bit to be desired.  Many of the streets in Gotham feel a bit too narrow for the Batmobile, so you’ll often collide against the side of buildings whenever you turn onto another street, and there are few streets that allow the Batmobile to accelerate to its top speed for more than a couple of seconds.  Gliding around the city and using your grappling hook is still a far more preferable method to traverse the urban landscape, especially since Batman can now select his next grappling target while still being reeled in on his hook, allowing for a more fast-paced, instantaneous travel experience. While I appreciate how this addition makes traveling more efficient, it takes away a lot of the skill required to hone the grappling hook in Arkham City, where accuracy and timing were more predominant.  The vehicle’s other mode transforms it into a tank that you use to engage unmanned, remote-controlled drones.  Most of these encounters boil down to shooting at enemy drones while constantly dodging their line of fire by quickly thrusting left or right. Continually obliterating these enemy drones progressively builds up a meter in the corner of the screen, which, once filled, allows your tank to unleash a barrage of missiles upon your enemies. Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong or broken with these tank battles, but they lack any real opportunities to approach them in different ways like the aforementioned sequences, both of which have had three games to be refined to perfection. Many of its sections in the game require you to sneak around behind a beefed-up tank and hit it in its weak spot, drive away, and then repeat the same attack. I firmly believe that the Batmobile should've been relegated as a transportation option only, or perhaps having side missions devoted to it, but certainly not mandatory for around 40% of main story missions. If the developers so desperately wanted it to be included in the primary missions, then those missions should’ve been open-ended to the point whereplayer can complete them in several different ways.  The other major issue I have with this game in terms of its game design is the absence of any substantial boss fights. Granted, there is one exception that takes place around halfway through the game, where Batman fights alongside Robin to defeat a formidable, muscle-bound African-American boxer. The fight sequence is one of the few highlights of the game because it takes advantage of the best aspects of the series. However, as good as the fight is, it doesn’t suffice when it lasts for ten minutes at most and it takes roughly 15 hours to complete the game. Almost every other boss fight in the game is vehicular, involving the same repetitive techniques you employ during each tank fight. This problem wouldn’t upset me so much if the boss fights in the previous games hadn’t been so excellent.  The game even rubs salt in the wound by featuring Deathstroke, with whom Batman had engaged in a momentous clash in Arkham Origins, only to have him fight Batman in yet another generic tank battle before getting his lights punched out instantly as soon as he steps foot outside his tank.  There are a bevy of side missions at your disposal, most of which I haven’t bothered to delve into just yet. I attempted to complete a few Riddler challenges, which, to my knowledge, only consist of driving the Batmobile around underground racetracks, which grew tiresome very quickly. Perhaps I’ll return to complete all of the side activities eventually, but from what I’ve experienced of them so far, they’re comparable to those featured in Arkham City.  The audiovisual presentation in this game is phenomenal on all fronts.  The Arkham games have always excelled in this department, but this game outclasses them by having better lighting, smoother animations, and far more activity occurring on screen at once.  This game joins, and even surpasses in some aspects, the ranks of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Far Cry 4 as being one of the best-looking games ever made.  In terms of sound, everything you hear during gameplay is fine, and the voice acting for the most part is good. I was disappointed in the Arkham Knight’s voice because it made him appear less intelligent and too whiney, and Kevin Conroy at times sounds uninspired during certain scenes, lacking inflection and conviction in his voice.  I know that a lot of people feel nothing but contempt for Arkham Origins, but for me, this is by far the worst game of this now four-part series. While the game is gorgeous to behold, and its hand-to-hand and predatory segments are mechanically flawless, many of the villains and ideas in the story are mishandled, the tank combat is lackluster, and there are hardly any worthwhile boss encounters.  Don’t get me wrong, this is still a solid enough game, (although I wouldn’t recommend paying full price for it) but it’s ultimately just extremely disappointing to me as a follow-up to Arkham City, which I still consider to be one of the best games I’ve ever played.	2015-08-19
US	20159988	R193YMOMJORGY4	B00BGA9YZK	242210477	Killzone: Shadow Fall (PlayStation 4)	Video Games	2	1	1	N	N	Boring, frustrating and uninspired.	I've had this game for several years and I've always put it off thinking I had to play the other two games in the series first. In the end I just decided I may as well play it and see what all of the fuss is about. I think that was a mistake. If I was more invested in the story plot-line I may have liked it more however I found it overall not very enjoyable.  There's a few very frustrating parts of this game and if you've done the free fall level you'll know what I mean. However overlooking that small portion of the game there's one other thing that is so frustrating. That is completely unintuitive objective design. There's so many times I was just lost not knowing where to go to next. It's no fun having to search around for five to ten minutes trying to figure out where i'm supposed to go next. The orange objective marker gives you a general idea where you have to go but it's up to you on how to get there which would be fine if the levels weren't so confusing.  This is especially true when they throw in an optional objective with no indication which orange marker is the optional one. Several times I progressed past that point to have some unintended consequence happen.  I didnt find the actual gameplay difficult at all. Most of the enemies were pretty dumb that always popped their head out of cover at the exact same place every time. Not even attempting to alter their patterns. I always thought Killzone was about good enemy AI.  Then there's the story. I found it extremely weak. The first mission most of all confused the heck out of me. You had this little cutscene first about how you'll be captured or something and then you are and are being exchanged. You have no idea what led up to your capture and you can only assume it's because you're bad at your job. The next thing you know you're infiltrating a site and I had no idea why.  Every mission I was on led me think that being a shadow marshal was akin to being a rent a cop and being pitted against petty criminals.I mean you' have a mission where you have to be a &#34;refugee&#34; and you're telling me no one knew that you were that previously captured spy? A shadow marshal sounds cool like you'd be able to stealth in and kill a lot of enemies before they even notice you're there. However you have no silenced weapons to use and your only stealth take downs are melee which would be fine if you actually use it more than once per level. Most of the time I'd just go out guns blazing and wait for the whack a moles to poke out their heads.  I seriously cant imagine playing this game again even if I missed a lot of collectables. I'd rather just play another game.	2015-08-19

It pairs easily, and the app that you need to download is easy to use and shows you exactly which games should work with the controller. Problem is that once you download those games, they don't all work anymore. Some message boards online say that it doesn't work with newer versions of Android which I can't verify but seems likely. I tried it on my HTC One M8, and my Nexus 7 (2014) and several games (Bard's Tale, Shadowgun) didn't work with either device. Also, I believe that this is the older version and many of the games listed on the MOGA website as compatible aren't listed as compatible within the app. This would be great if it worked, but sadly it just doesn't. I'd order a newer version if I knew it would work, but don't really have a lot of faith in it at the moment.	2015-08-19

As you gain experience you learn ways to survive the zombies and you may or may not want to venture out much at night. There are some tasks that require you to perform them in the evening but I found some of those were suggestions rather than required. The Witch Queen task told me to collect mushrooms from a cave in the evening but I had no trouble doing it during the daytime by staying near the water to kill off the zombies and Volatiles first.<br /><br />This is a rare game for me where I struggled to collect a gun (pistol from police van) but then hardly used it.  Loud noises bring bad monsters to you.  Eventually you will start killing humans and get a good number of police and military rifles (and a shotgun).  Eventually the merchants will start carrying the guns too.  My favorite weapon is the Molotov cocktail though.  It's a fairly quiet, mass zombie killer. I made sure I had 10 to 20 created before starting a mission.<br /><br />Tough but very fun game.	2015-08-19

I am a big Godzilla fan and I think any one who enjoys watching the older Godzilla movies today would love this game. I give 5 stars for Godzilla Fans but for others I would say they might want to rent this game first before buying it.<br /><br />Graphic are not great but the Monster models are very well done. All the monsters look just like there movie version and almost all of them have the abilities that they had in the movies. The only one I think of that is missing an ability is Gigan's Chest Buzz-saw but this could be because they went with the Gigan's upgraded form from Godzilla:Final Wars. The only monster that was not included in this game that I wish was in it is Megalon.<br /><br />The landscape is one of the issues I think the game has. You are locked into a fairly small area and your objective is either to destory the G-Energy plants or to defend them. The area are not that big and there is not a lot of variety. But what they get right is the destruction part. The building explode and pieces fly everywhere. The even have the sound they used in the movies for the explosion.<br /><br />One of the biggest complaints I see about the game is the controls. I can understand people may not like the control scheme because they are so used to the normal third person games. But to me it makes sense. These monsters are more like tanks then say a character like Nathan Drake and the controls fit. I personally like being able to swing the camera around the monster I am controlling because it give it more of that movie feel which I think the Developers were really going for.<br /><br />The combat in the game is a bit hit or miss. Some of the monster are really overpowered and there is little challenge in fighting most of the AI controls monster. The Online mode is very much hit or miss. I like the 3 for all better then the 1 on 1 becausethere is some strategy in the those fights.<br /><br />The game in my opinion is not perfect in the mind of a general gamer but I would say it is perfect for the Godzilla Fans. It is a cross between a monster sim and movie sim. At the current price I think Godzilla fans should give it a try.	2015-08-19

This is not the best version of Daytona USA, even the enhanced edition that was released later on for the same system was better than the launch Sega Saturn version! But god damn it, if this isn't the most care-free racing game, than it's Outrun. The controls are tight, easy to use but hard to master! The music is an acquired taste, but it's so good, I couldn't tell you why someone didn't like it! The bad things about this version, are everything around the amazing racing game in the core of it all. The draw distance is bad, yet that was mostly a Saturn issue, since even the enhanced Saturn version titled 'Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition' here in the states had a poor draw distance compared to the Playstation racing game of the time. It also has more to the game, like tracks and cars. So if you want a bigger game with good music, just get the enhanced version; but if you want a smaller game, with amazing music, you get Daytona USA, for the Sega Saturn!	2015-08-19

US	13172811	R210TCF7BT4UM9	B00TEDK8FQ	535078634	Ortz PS4 Vertical Stand with Cooling Fan - Controller Charging Station with Dual Charger	Video Games	5	66	90	N	N	Sturdy, provides super convenient charging, adds 2 USB ports to my PS4, while also really cleaning up my clutter.	Note: I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review. I review all products as if I paid full price for it. Price of this product at time of review on Amazon is $24.99.<br /><br />Before getting this stand, I would always start up my PS4 to find that my controller has run out of battery. Yes, I know that all I have to do is to remember to plug in my controller into the cable after I am done using it, but my laziness and my forgetfulness always won. With this, I just put my controller into the stand after a playing session, and the controller is fully charged the next time I pick it up. The controller is super easy to put into the charging dock on the stand--it is literally a perfect fit and you do not have to delicately aim for the charger or anything. It is so much easier than plugging a cable into your controller that it isn't even funny.<br /><br />The stand is really stable, and all it needs to power the fan and the chargers for the controller is for you to plug the small USB cable on the stand into your PS4. There is no extra power cable that is running to the stand that you can potentially trip on or anything.<br /><br />As pictured, there are two docks on the stand for your controllers to charge, and there are an additional 3 USB ports on the stand for you to plug in cables if you need. Out of your two USB ports on the PS4, you lose one to power the stand, but with the additional 3 on the stand, you are essentially expanding the 2 USB ports on your PS4 to 4 USB ports.<br /><br />I have had no problems with overheating, but I know many people do, so the fan and the vertical positioning is an added plus for me too.<br /><br />The stand does so much--it cools your PS4, provides super convenient charging docks for two controllers, acts as a USB hub that essentially doubles your USB ports...and it does all this while actually cutting down on all my clutter. I find that I can just store my charging cables away most of the time now becauseI actually remember to charge my controllers, so I no longer have cords running across the room from the PS4 to my controller. I also remember to put the controller away right on the stand, and no longer have the controller put away in random places around the room.<br /><br />This stand has significantly made my life easier, and I would purchase this stand again if it ever breaks. I would also recommend this to my friends and family that are looking for a cooling stand or an organizer for their PS4 without any hesitation.	2015-08-19

Whenever I buy an open-world RPG, I accept the risk that the $60 I spent will be wasted on a game I'll never play. Generally speaking, I quickly get bored with RPGs: the confusing 10-page character menus, the tedious herb-gathering or ore-mining, and the pointless side-quests. For that reason, I feared that Witcher 3 would collect dust on my shelf. But so far, the game is nearly impossible to stop playing. At the moment, I'm inclined to call it the first great RPG of the next generation consoles!<br /><br />Graphics 9/10: Definitely nex-gen quality. Human faces are unique and detailed, a great improvement from games like Skyrim. The environment itself isn't as awe-inspiring as Skyrim, as it lacks mountains and feels more restrictive. However, it does well what it chooses to do. My only complaint is that sometimes the fields or forests are overwhelmingly bright and colorful. It's almost too much to take in.<br /><br />Gameplay/Mechanics 8/10: I admit, Gerault is sometimes hard to control. My biggest issue is how easily he can fall over the sides of narrow bridges, stairs, etc. Many recent games make it impossible to fall to your death at such times, but Witcher doesn't. This isn't a huge problem, but its worth noting. Otherwise, the mechanics are pretty good, especially in combat (explained next).<br /><br />Combat 9.5/10: The combat is exceptionally good. I like how it allows players to integrate parries, dodges, spells, and basic attacks into each combat situation. I also like how sword duels include swords clashing against swords. Unlike games like Assassin's Creed, where holding LT would block unlimited attacks from unlimited attackers, Witcher requires parries to be expertly timed. Sometimes, evading attacks is safer than parrying. This makes for a flexible and interactive combat experience.<br /><br />Story and Acting 10/10: The story is compelling and interesting. In particular, the characters are interesting. Doug Cockle brings Gerault's character to life with his low, cynical-sounding voice and narration. This is refreshing after games like Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed, and Destiny failed miserably to give personality to their lead characters. This game is still behind The Last of Us, but it's also many times longer than that game.<br /><br />Quests: I haven't finished a ton of quests, but so far so good. I like how each quests starts with a cut-scene which showcases the games good graphics and thorough attention to detail. Each quest, no matter how small, introduces a new character with a new personality. I really enjoyed that. Many large-scale games get lazy and have 70% of all characters looking/acting like everyone else.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase. The cut scenes are really great, the acting is great, and the combat keeps things entertaining. I just finished Shadow of Mordor (which I liked) and was looking to play something just as good or better. So far, as expected, Witcher is better. I'll keep you updated as I proceed through the game.<br /><br />Update: I have now put nearly 50 hours into the game, and it doesn't disappoint!

Sometimes something that looks great on the surface doesn't stay that way deeper down. Toy Soldiers: Hall of Fame War Chest Edition is a decently fun continuation of the Toy Soldiers series that ends up making itself shallower in some areas while trying to make itself deeper. There is a single player campaign, multiplayer and co-op modes, weekly “wars” and multiple hero armies to choose from. While all the variety makes the game broad, it doesn’t make it very deep in the process.<br /><br /> The game’s campaign takes place over a series of varied environments set to replicate various genres of toys. You start out with the Kaiser’s army, which will be familiar to anyone who played the original Toy Soldiers. Through the next couple of missions you are able to unlock the Ghost army, which is a futuristic sci-fi oriented guerilla army, a Rainbow Bright army which is, well, fairies and gummy bears and Rainbow Bright-esque units, and finally the Dark Lord’s army which is a fantasy themed army. Each hero comes with a unique army type around the theme of the hero as listed above. There are additional heroes available for purchase, GI Joe, Cobra (from GI Joe), He-Man and Ezio from Assassin’s Creed. The four purchasable heroes have armies made of toys from their respective themes. The campaign itself has a good variety in the different environments you face. From WWI trenched battlefields to bright colorful game boards to asteroid mining bases you end up fighting the four original heroes in their own themes. There are three survival battlefields to fight each of the purchasable heroes (GI Joe and Cobra are combined) where you fight for as long as possible until overrun.<br /><br /> Gameplay is the same as the previous games. Build towers to defend a toy box from an onslaught of enemies coming in waves. Through the game as you level up your heroes you gain blind boxes, as the game calls them, that unlock upgrades or you can purchase the upgrades for towers with coins you earn throughout the game. Upgrades are specific to the towers for that hero. The coins are given out generously enough that over the course of doing the campaign with a hero I easily unlocked every upgrade for Cobra and had a pile of coins to spare. If you control towers during the game and rack up kills with them you’re able to unlock a single use powerful hero or barrage to aid you when called upon. Once used you can earn the hero or barrage again by controlling towers and killing enemies. You can repeat that cycle as many times as you wish over the course of a match.<br /><br /> While there is a good amount of variety, a lot of it becomes superficial as the game goes on. There are a variety of hero armies, but they all basically play the same. There’s an anti-infantry tower, anti-armor tower, anti-air tower and an artillery tower. They look different and have some variation in cost and power, but each hero army has the same four basic towers that operate the same as the other hero armies. The campaign is the same no matter which hero army you use, and all the upgrades you unlock for the towers operate basically the same. The armies you fight in the campaign have a light infantry unit, heavy infantry unit, light armor unit, heavy armor unit, light air and heavy air. They may look different and act a little different but the basic concepts remain the same. While on the surface there is a lot of variety, and through the first games you play there will feel like a lot of variety, as the game goes on it becomes more of the same with different skins. It can also be annoying because you level up each hero separately and each tower upgrade for each hero army separately. So while my Cobra towers were beefed up, my Kaiser’s army towers were all base level after completing the campaign and a few other matches.<br /><br /> Stylistically the game looks good. On a technical level it won’t blow you away but it’s not a full priced game and if you’ve played theprevious Toy Soldier games you’ll know basically what to expect. Style over technical. The sound is decent. No real dialogue but the towers sound good and there are snipits of dialogue from the people manning the towers.<br /><br /> I went into Toy Soldiers: Hall of Fame War Chest Edition expecting about what I got out of the original two Toy Soldier games. A solid campaign that I would play through once, maybe twice and then just kind of walk away from it. And that’s basically what I got. I didn’t play through it twice like I did with Toy Soldiers Cold War, but it was decently fun, if a bit repetitive the first time through. I never felt the game’s battles were as deep as the previous two games. There weren’t as many towers and I felt like, while there was a good variety in the scenery and armies you fought, the levels didn’t feel as well developed. Perhaps that’s just me.<br /><br /> In the case of Toy Soldiers War Chest Hall of Fame Edition the appeal in the first couple of matches doesn't carry on deeper into the game. Things looks great on the surface, but don't necessarily evolve or improve as the game goes on. There is a ton of content in the game, if you like do the same thing over and over for various heroes. Some people will like to do that. I’ve reached NG++++ on Dark Souls 2, so obviously I’m not opposed to repeatedly playing something if the game is right, which this will be for some people. I would say for the majority of people this would be a better rent than buy. After playing the game I would probably put it at a $20 price point value to buy if I hadn't already played the game. It doesn't feel like a full priced game. I beat the campaign in an evening and didn’t really feel any need to go back. But if you get into the game and want to earn all the platinum medals and level up all the heroes there’s a lot of content.	2015-08-19

US	52423623	RYZODJIM3MVUV	B00STU8L3Q	97158859	The Elder Scrolls Online	Video Games	4	12	12	N	N	Greatly improved after disastrous launch; no subscription fee a plus	Plagued with bugs at launch last year, the massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Elder Scrolls Online is now much improved.  It also had its $15-a-month subscription fee removed earlier this year, making it one of the most-played MMORPGs right now.  Set in the Elder Scrolls universe, ESO offers much more territories to travel than earlier ES games: you can visit much of Tamriel, including parts of Skyrim and Cyrodiil, and beyond.  ESO offers a good mix of solo-questing, group-questing, combat, crafting, guild participation, and storytelling.  Those who played earlier ES games will not lose the single-player &#34;feel&#34; in the gameplay, while still being able to participate in group plays that MMORPGs are made for.  There are, of course, many differences between ESO and earlier ES games.  You need constant Internet connection to play ESO, of course, and you need an account with Bethesda, the publisher.  As in other MMORPGs, you see other online players in the game in places accessible to all, but there are areas &#34;instanced&#34; only to you.  Everything in ESO happens in real time: you cannot save and load game, or pause during action.  Many enemies respawn a certain time after being killed, so other online players can fight them.  Your inventory is limited to 60 items at the start; you can buy additional slots later; there is no weight associated with each item.  You cannot put items in containers as in earlier ES games; you can only put them in your inventory or your &#34;bank account&#34; (which is also limited to 60 items at the start).  There are only about 20 ingredients each for alchemy, enchanting, food, and drink, unlike Skyrim that has over 100 of each.  Regarding quick travel, you can only quick-travel to &#34;waypoints&#34; located throughout Tamriel, and you pay a fee if your departure point is not a waypoint.  Significantly, ESO doesn't let you switch weapons during combat, unless when you reach Level 15, which will give you a secondary weapon slot.  One big difference compared to earlier ES games is that you have a large amount of magical attacks at your disposal even if you are not a mage or at low levels.  EVERY WEAPON TYPE is associated with a whole slew of magical attacks, called &#34;active abilities&#34; here.  Bows have a set of attacks, 2-handed weapons have a set, as do dual-wield weapons, destruction staves, and one-handed weapons with shields.  In addition, active abilities are also given to your class, your race, and the guilds you have joined.  Some of these abilities use magicka, and some use stamina.  Some of these attacks are fairly powerful as well, even at low levels, so you cannot ignore their use.  That makes it imperative even for non-mage characters to have an ample amount of magicka and stamina.  You up either your health, magicka, or stamina by one point every time you level up.  There are also &#34;treasure maps&#34; throughout Tamriel, some you can find in your travels, and some you start with if you buy some of the special editions of ESO, such as &#34;Explorers' Pack&#34; or &#34;Imperial Edition&#34;.  A treasure map is a crudely drawn picture of a treasure chest's location.  Such maps are quite numerous in the game.  Another interesting feature of ESO are &#34;dolmen battles&#34;.  A dolmen is a portal that occasionally pours out an army of daedric creatures, sort of like Oblivion Gates in &#34;Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&#34;.  There are many dolmens throughout Tamriel.  Fighting in dolmen battles gives you experience points, achievements, and loot.  Looting dead enemies is a little different in ESO in that if you killed the enemy more &#34;efficiently&#34;, you might get better loot.  Same thing happens in dolmen battles: the player who performed most efficiently in the battle gets the most loot.  Leveling up is handled in similar fashion as in Skyrim and Oblivion: you gain experience points by completing quests and also by performing tasks that yield experience for such tasks.  E.g. using a bow grants you experience for your Bow skill, crafting an iron weapon gives you Blacksmith skill experience, etc.  ESO also has &#34;crafting writs&#34;, where you craft a specified amount of weapons and armor to get rewards and experience.  Rewards can be quite significant for such tasks so don't pass them up.  One popular quest line in Skyrim is Dark Brotherhood, which unfortunately is not in ESO.  A recent announcement by Bethesda, however, hinted that Dark Brotherhood would be added later on.  Thieves Guild also doesn't seem to be in ESO.  But there are &#34;fences&#34; who buy your stolen goods and clear your bounty.  You cannot buy homes in ESO the way you do in earlier ES games.  About the only things you need to buy are horses and extra inventory slots, and both are expensive.  You can buy either the 2014 launch version of ESO or the renamed &#34;Tamriel Unlimited&#34; edition from 2015, provided you obtain an unused activation code.  Whether you install from discs or online, the game will automatically download all the latest patches (many gigabytes in total) before you can start the game.	2015-08-19

Because it is retractable, it is a flat, thin cable. Be careful with it, and hopefully it will last forever.<br /><br />I am glad that I can finally play my PSP again. I was pleased to find out that my battery isn't 100% dead. I couldn't charge it with a USB cable, and my regular AC Adapter was dead before that. I can play my PSP through the battery, and it will even turn on with no battery in the system, so I'm glad to know the PSP doesn't need to buffer power through the battery or anything like that.	2015-08-19

I grew up with Mario Party 1,2,3 and loved them. Years later my sister and I would break out the N64 and throw down in some classic MP. I bought the Wii U last year because I figured why not, they are finally getting good games. My girlfriend who never played MP growing up likes the game but I personally don't. My biggest complaint is that they removed stars from the game! Getting &#34;mini-stars&#34; is now the objective and the amount you get is 20% skill and 80% luck. The serious competitive nature is gone and has been replaced by chance and awards for participation basically. There is also the possibility that you can go an entire game without playing a minigame because unless you hit a chance block or minigame space there are no games.<br /><br />The only thing that saves the game is the amiibo party and bowser party. Amiibo party is very similar to the Mario Party games of old but to play it you need to buy amiibos! It's just more money out of your pocket!<br /><br />In summary, it's a very dumbed down version of what was once a great game. Shame on Nintendo for doing this. I give it more than 1 star because my girlfriend enjoys it and amiibo party is OK	2015-08-19

I had a pair of FPS freeks for my 360, and they worked great, however they were pretty expensive. The concept of having an elevated stick makes sense, and it makes a noticeable difference. I honestly can't play without them. When I upgraded to the Xbone, I knew it was time to get some FPS Again, but they were too expensive, so I looked for an alternative and happily found one with these. If you choose to buy these, you will not be settling for a lesser product; in my eyes you would be upgrading. You get 8 thumb sticks for the price of what it cost to get 2 from FPS freeks. These thumb sticks stay on better, don't damage your controller as bad as the freeks do, and simply look better on the controller.	2015-08-19

I bought these for office use (90% music and 10% phone calls). I wanted something wireless, over-the-ear style that I could wear all day, and with an extendible mic and mute button. After reviewing the comments on these, I figured I'd give it a shot, but unfortunately, I was quite disappointed - even for the price point.<br /><br />I would be using these for 90% music and 10% phone calls, so I wanted something with good sound quality. I've scrolled through all of the 3 eq settings on these and none of them sound very good at all. It sounds hollow all over the spectrum. I like a very well balanced speaker and am certain not a fan of 'bass thumping', but the bass on these is just ok at best. It's rather muddy and lackluster. It's there, but it just feels lazy. The mid range follows the same pattern. It just sounds lifeless and stressed. Similar story with the treble - it lacks presence and doesn't draw you into the musical experience. To add to the frustration, there is always a hum regardless of the volume levels you set it at. I do know about proper gain structure, but setting up the gain structure properly did nothing to help the hum - it's just always there and always comes through between songs or during quiet parts and is really distracting. It doesn't really get very loud either if that's your thing - it runs out of steam long before my $10 earbuds would even break a sweat.<br /><br />I haven't found these to be terribly comfortable although they are ok I guess given that I haven't used them for extended periods. Their physical size it a bit large, but I haven't felt as though they're about to fall off.<br /><br />The range is pretty good and I can walk around the office and my team's section without it breaking up at all, but the usb plug is abouttwice the size of an old school usb stick when they first came out and also plugs into your computer's headphone jack.<br /><br />In general, they're kinda cool with the color changing feature and all and the range is good, but the sound quality just kills it for me. I've gone back to my old setup of my $10 ear buds and a cheapo headset for calls and this is now collecting dust in my drawer.	2015-08-19

Traditionally, microswitch buttons have a better response time since they don't have the same amount of travel as conventional buttons do, so this controller works pretty damned well!

US	36999276	R1POFN4JU8LBHI	B00002STUC	854872433	Ghen War [Sega Saturn]	Video Games	3	0	0	N	N	A pretty good mech warrior type FPS that falls short in some key areas	This is a Saturn only release that provides a pretty fun intergalactic romp against an untrustworthy alien race called the Ghen. This is basically a first person shooter more akin to the likes of Mech Warrior than it is Doom or Duke Nukem. You control a mech suit fully loaded with an arsenal of weapons, including blasters w/unlimited ammo, rockets, homing missiles, mines and even a decoy to fool your enemy. Although they look dated today, the graphics were probably cutting edge for its time (1995) and feature full 360° controls, detailed enemies and solid effects. The music and sound effects are a strong point of this title. When enemies approach, the music picks up pace and intensity, creating a more realistic and powerful enemy encounter. There are also nifty full motion video cut scenes with live actors between each mission. While they feature some cheesy acting, it is still cool and almost like watching a movie to tell the story of the game.<br /><br />Two major complaints about Ghen War are the controls and the lives/continue system, or lack there of. Firstly, although there are lots of different weapons and maneuvers available, it is cumbersome using them all on a control pad. For example, you have to scroll through all of the weapons with one button, so during the heat of battle, you have to take your eyes off of the enemy and watch the weapon box until you land upon your weapon of choice. That's just not conducive to real time combat! I've found myself getting hit numerous times while trying to switch weapons and navigate the clunky controls. Combine that with slow and cumbersome movement of your mech, and it can be a recipe for disaster during heavy battle. This might not be as bad if you had a fair amount of lives or continues, but you don't. Once you lose all of your lives, you are forced back to the beginning of the entire game and it replaces your existing save! It's like starting all over. As if that weren't bad enough, if you have to leave a mission for whatever reason, you lose a life. You must complete the current mission and allow the game to auto-save your progress to avoid this. There is just no reason for this kind of nonsense and it really detracted from what could have been a pretty good game.<br /><br />Regarding the controls, Ghen War probably would play much better on a PC, where you could assign weapons to specific keys and use a mouse/keyboard for movement. With the control pad and they way they laid out the controls, it is a bit awkward and especially bad for real time combat. Overall, this is a decent game with some cool features, full motion video sequences and quality audio. Although, given the shortcomings that are virtual game breakers, giving it 3 stars is a little bit generous.er reason, you lose a life.

Also it does not (fully) work on PC natively, and you have to use some third party software. I haven't gotten bluetooth working, but that could be my old BT device..<br /><br />Anyway it is a better controller than my previous xbox 360 wireless one, so there's that. Just, if you want to get a silicon skin for it, make sure it isn't too snug around the leftmost buttons. They don't protrude quite so high and may not be easy to press.	2015-08-19

Before providing more details on the pleasure of playing the game, one must first review the product and the packaging itself. The front cover is a wonderful piece of art that can only help to separate this game from the many soulless covers used for entertainment products in the modern market place. Once inside, the buyer will find a colorful disk and an instruction booklet featuring another terrific illustration of the main cast of characters. Instruction booklets are no longer common place for video games, and to find one with a separate artwork from the main cover is even more rare, making a nice additional treat to the product's artistic packaging. As can be told by the cover, Tales of Graces f is rated Teen, but parents shouldn't be worried, there is no blood and very little language. It gains it's Teen rating from mature themes, and some suggestive jokes.    As for story, players will be treated to a tale of friendship, and the struggles of growing up together in the political landscape of three conflicting nations. At first the political overtones are light and seem to matter very little, but they become more complex and intriguing, as do the characters the player is following. Despite this, the game is humorous throughout, and almost all of the main cast display a sense of sarcasm, even the seemingly gruff Malik. Those who enjoy anime, will derive extra fun from the game's magically animated cinematic scenes and skits. Fans hoping for a Japanese voice over track to be included with this localization will be sadly disappointed, but can also take heart in the fact that the English voice overs are for the most part extremely well done, especially for the main characters. Asbel, Cheria, Sophie, Pascal, Hubert, Richard, and Malikare all paired with actors who fit their appearance and emotions, both as children and adults. As the long and epic tale progresses, one can expect twists, betrayals, deaths, and a budding romance between Asbel and Cheria that continues to develop throughout the story from the time they are children.    Gameplay consists of exploring and battling, and fans of the &#34;Tales of&#34; series will find a refinement of what has come before.

It is fun to play with someone else and can be either relaxing or stressful at times. I also liked that you can play with other players to try to get through certain levels. I am new to gaming (unlike my husband who is pro), but eventually I just felt weird that I was playing a video game with kids that is made for kids. Also, the game got laggy at times and if you have a short attention span, that is no fun.<br /><br />This game definitely helped me learn how to use the controller and was a great introduction to gaming, but I just felt too old and want to branch out into other games.	2015-08-19

Note: I bought the same Wii U bundle used from another vendor so no there's &#34;confirmed purchase&#34; next to my review.<br /><br />I've played (console) videogames since 1985 when I was, coincidentally, 5.<br /><br />I started off with an NES, then moved on to an SNES, then Genesis, then (after a gap) a PS2, PS3, XBox 360 with a Kinect (a nod to and an attempt to find games for our then-young children), and now PS4.<br />The last is down in the bedroom as a disc/streaming/gaming machine.  The PS3 is up in the family TV room as, honestly at this point, a disc/Netflix/Amazon player and Minecraft console for our now-slightly-older kids, and the 360's about to be moved into a workout area for the Kinect fitness games.<br />I'd tried to drag my kids along into gaming (SEE? LITTLE BIG PLANET IS GREAT! PLAY IT!), but Minecraft's the only one that's stuck.<br /><br />Then I stopped by a local gaming store and bought a used Wii U, some controllers, Splatoon, MarioKart 8, and Super Smash Bros (the console came with Super Mario 3D).  By that evening, we'd only gotten to MarioKart - we were having so much fun.<br />As I whipped around a corner and did a trick-jump as Yoshi, I realized that I was grinning from ear to ear.<br />Super Mario 3D was just as smile-inducing and filled with loads of nostalgia (for me, anyway - I had to explain to my kids why I thought some of the references and levels were funny) and Super Smash Bros...well, I just spent a bit too much money on a Samus amiibo (her nickname: Samawesome), our middle &#34;earned&#34; her Link by spontaneously changing out the tablecloth after she spilled something on it during breakfast, our eldest has a Zelda held in reserve awaiting an act of uncoerced chore doing, our youngest has a Pikachu chilling until she does something spectacular befitting a small child, and I have a Mega Man on order for my not-as-enthusiastic-about-games-but-with-fond-Mega-Man-II-memories husband. And we've been able to play all of these together - thank you, Nintendo, for keeping local co-op alive.<br />Splatoon, currently being test driven by our eldest after she did crafts with and made lunch for her little sisters (score), also seems like it'll be as colorfully raucous as the rest.  I may even let my kids dip their toes into online play given that Nintendo (pretty sagely if they're trying to keep it family-friendly) developed it without voice chat.<br /><br />No, it doesn't have the processing power of this gen's consoles, but I wouldn't want to play Witcher 3 on this.<br />It does what it does and it does it well - fun but friendly games, (mostly) local co-op, and a control system that gets you a bit more into the game  without being unbearably awkward and buggy like just about everything that's been done so far with cameras and paired sensors.<br /><br />Even after dropping every single dollar of a (smallish) equity payment we received after a sale on the system, enough controllers for our family of five, a few games, and a few amiibo, the only thing I regret is not jumping back into Nintendo's world sooner.-op alive.

Be forewarned you're not using silenced rifles in this game so, the first unsilenced shot you take might put you into a fire fight. My biggest pet peeve is the lack of close quarter combat when enemies managed to get right on top of you. And the reload speed is frustrating for those moments when the enemies are in the same room with you. Other then that the graphics are pretty good and detailed looking forward to playing 3.	2015-08-19

I've used a lot of generic products to go along with my wife's PS4 and PS3.  Usually, generic products are cheaper to buy, but are inferior products.  We needed a new charging cord for her PS4 remotes, and decided to buy this because you get two cords, and if it didn't work, we weren't out too much money.  To my surprise, it worked great.  Her and my son are using it all the time, and have no complaints on it's effectiveness.  The only slightly negative thing is that the cord isn't very long, but it's long enough to where you don't need to sit right in front of the TV.  It works to charge and you can use it while it's charging.  Great product!	2015-08-19

However, about halfway through I really started to get it. Its now one of my favorite Lego games for Wii. New for the lego series: quests that earn you bricks or cheats; treasures that you can collect or build and use at anytime during freeplay; characters can pick up smaller characters and even throw them, ability to use multiple weapons, treasures, hats, shields and other items.<br /><br />No major bugs or glitches found, this is a big plus as the Lego games are increasingly glitchy (even on Wii U). I do wish it has a hi-def make over for Wii U, you can tell its scaled down from HD, but its still a lot of fun to play.	2015-08-19

Right from the start it reminded me of playing Ellie from The Last Of Us.  I liked how the bow was a great stealth and power weapon.  If you enjoy stealth and shooter games like Thief, Hitman and Dishonored you will like Tomb Raider.  It is not as open world as Fall Out or Far Cry and it has its share of &#34;forced&#34; tasks which I did not enjoy (some forced sliding/jumping scenes).  Tomb Raider also has you doing quite a few tower climbs.  If you have experience with Far Cry's towers these will seem familiar.	2015-08-19

It's hilarious, the gameplay is perfection (once you get used to it), and all the weapons are so unique and fun to use. I highly recommend this to anyone that appreciates games that are centered around pure, unadulterated FUN, because that's what Sunset Overdrive delivers. There's no deep backstory or anything like that, and the game knows it (the characters even break the fourth wall to make fun of how implausible the story is). It's purely designed to be a fun and ridiculous escape from real life, and it accomplishes that incredibly well. My only complaint is that it's over :(<br /><br />P.S. the DLC is also top notch, if a bit short-lived	2015-08-19

I mean they are practically the same case minus the different aesthetic.<br /><br />Looks great. Comes with 6 slots for any New 3DS/3DS/DSi/DS games, which if you're using this for travelling purposes (what other reason is there? aesthetic?) should be more than enough games to suit your needs. You'll either arrive at your destination or your 3DS will die (assuming you aren't able to charge during your travels: some people can) from low battery.<br /><br />Comes with a slot to store one stylus, and of course a big open storage area for your New 3DS/3DS XL. As I have literally just received this a few hours ago, I haven't actually needed to use it for travelling yet, but I've been messing around with the case, filling it up with all my New 3DS goodies and it works like a charm. The retro themed aesthetic tops it off. Great buy for a decent price.<br /><br />Can never go wrong with HORI branded products, seeing as they're usually officially backed by Nintendo themselves anyways.	2015-08-19

When I unwrapped it, I was astounded at how nice it looked on the outside. But, that's about it. The controller is obviously defective. Very, very laggy at times, also tends to overreact when buttons are hit (if i hit the &#34;A&#34; button once, it will reguster that i hit it 3+times.)and way too often it is just flat out unresponsive. Complete waste of money. If the seller would have taken time to test the product for literally 30 seconds, they would have discovered that the product was dysfunctional. Please spend the extra few bucks and get a brand new one to avoid this issue.	2015-08-19

I bought the Game Of The Year edition some time ago. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 action-adventure game debuted on May 18, 2010. The game proved to become one of Rockstar Studio’s masterpieces. I’ve been a fan of Rockstar’s storytelling since Grand Theft Auto III released back in 2003. Their particular brand of storytelling shines through in Red Dead Redemption.<br /><br />  Red Dead Redemption is based inside Rockstar’s version of our universe (which is not the same as the Grand Theft Auto universes) in 1911. The Wild West is dead and dying as American civilization reigns in outlaws and charlatans. John Marston, a reformed outlaw, is caught in the middle of progress’ warpath. As Marston, you step off a train at the station in fictitious Armadillo (based on Amarillo). There you head to Fort Mercer with a local guide where you are shot in the gut and left for dead. Marston awakens in a ranch hand’s hut. It’s revealed through the ranch owner, Bonnie MacFarlane, scooped you up, put you in a wagon, and took you to a doctor in Armadillo. Bonnie politely interrogates Marston, revealing that he was hunting wanted outlaw and gang leader, Bill Williamson. She then asks Marston to work off the fifteen-dollar medical bill and he obliges. After the bill is paid, Bonnie recommends heading to the U.S. Marshall’s office in Armadillo concerning any aid in assaulting Fort Mercer in search of Bill Williamson. I’m going to stop with the plot here because I hate spoilers as much as the next person.<br /><br />  Where gameplay is concerned, Red Dead Redemption functions like any other open-world game that you would expect from Rockstar. The major difference here is that many towns, settlements, and cities are in-game days apart. It gives a more realistic experience, but after two hours real world time it becomes a pain in the ass. Over time, Rockstar has learned a few things about whatfans want. In Grand Theft Auto IV, developers introduced a functioning taxi system that allowed gamers to travel to any selected area within reason. That idea transferred over to Red Dead Redemption in the form of stagecoaches. They do not allow you to travel to any point on the game map, but they cut ten-minute journeys into 3-second hops between towns. Red Dead Redemption employs a slow-motion gunslinging ability called the Dead-Eye. This allows the player to successfully fend off an insane slew of enemies ranging from the garden-variety coyote, the coyote’s cousin – the wolf, to Mexican rebels and fugitive American outlaws. Within a few hours of playing, you will pick up on the importance of the shotgun to stagecoach drivers and their passengers “riding shotgun.” The game being set in early 1900s America; there is a wide array of weaponry available. There are at least three or four variants in each type of gun (pistol/revolver, shotgun, repeater rifle, sniper rifle, thrown, explosive, and lasso/whip). Carriages can become difficult to maneuver because they have a different default button scheme than what the average gamer has been accustomed to with other vehicles in videogames.<br /><br />  The setting in Red Dead Redemption is mostly based on the Four Corners area of the American Southwest. The graphics are gorgeous. Leaves in the trees and wild fields move in the breeze. In two years, Rockstar considerably updated their graphics. That’s a comparison between Red Dead Redemption (2010) and Grand Theft Auto IV (2008). It’s easy to forget your goal and simply ride off into the sunset on a wild mustang you just broke in (entirely possible, by the way). Erik Brudvig at IGN (2010) said, “The setting of Red Dead Redemption, leaving out the interactive elements, is an achievement in itself.”<br /><br />  When I purchase videogames, I ask myself why should I purchase them. In regards to Red Dead Redemption in particular, this game has a huge factor to figure. If you love Western genre entertainment then you will love this game. If you hate Western flicks then this game is going to lose about sixty percent appeal. Western movie fans will appreciate the subtle nods to popular movies like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, Fistful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, Tombstone, and True Grit. If you happen to enjoy the open-endedness of open-world games then you will most likely enjoy Red Dead Redemption. Maybe you prefer the freedom to embrace good or evil. If you have ever wanted to act out your favorite Western – this is your chance! So why should you purchase Red Dead Redemption? Well for one, this award-winning game currently holds a 95 and a 9/10 on Metacritic. IGN gives it a 9.7. It currently holds 4.6 out of 5 stars on Amazon. The Official Xbox Magazine (2010) said, “Red Dead Redemption is a truly epic resuscitation of the Western theme in games. It's also easily the best gunslinging game we've ever played.” Critics and fellow gamers aren’t wrong about the game. It’s a masterpiece – complete with a compelling story that is deserving of your time and money.	2015-08-19

This is an ALMOST arcade perfect port. A couple of things are missing from the PS1 version that the arcade had.<br />1. Victor, Rikuo,and Huitzil character sprites are missing animation frames.<br />2. The PS1 game music will eventually die down and then start back up. It will not continually play on like in the arcade version.<br />3. The colors in PS1 version are actually better than the arcade version. This is probably the only thing that the PS1 version has that is better than the arcade.<br /><br />Other than these minor quirks, the game is a great translation of the arcade version. Its very much identical to the arcade version.	2015-08-19

I bought this mouse when it came to my attention via youtuber Elric Phares. When I got it in my hands I was impresed by the contruction quality the entire mouse feels solid, the switches, the cord and even the USB cable. The mouse features dpi switches that can also be used as other keys through the disk that contains drivers/tolls for this mouse. The program can let you change the dpi levels (of which there are 4), color, and even change the button layout completely! I've set up my dpi switches to launch windows explorer and launch the run window. You can even make your own macros for games or other OS functions. The mouse features a weight cartrige that can let you customize the weight of the mouse, and also has really smooth pads on the bottom that make this mouse a pleasure to use. I don't have any negative comments about this mouse.	2015-08-19

What you can do, is once you get a fast lap you think will stand, you can pit and then hit the fast forward on time until the end of the session. The same goes for qualifying laps for the big race on sundays. So all this talk about how long you have to do this or that is overblown, imo. Race day is a kick, and I find the racing mechanics better than Forza 5. And let's be honest, this game was designed to be played with a racing wheel. Try going 50+ laps with a xbox controller. it won't work. Also, I agree the radio guy's voice is hard to hear at first. But you can adjust settings. After awhile, you have no trouble understanding what he is saying. I love the championship mode, as you practice, qualify for pole position, and then race. Each track has its own adjustments, so take advantage of practice, especially if you have parc ferme rules on. Monoco, for example, emphasizes slow speed on turning ability. I just enjoy the set up of the game. True, the game could allow you to design your own driver, and car, and team, and logos, but hey, playability is outstanding! oh, and get a wheel.	2015-08-19

The fact that it's a pc games adds a whole other level of difficulty for these kinds of games. It's not like an old NES game where you can go by an old nes to play the game. You have to find a way to play an old PC game on a new PC. Which is not too hard it's just a headache.	2015-08-19

The controller made by Arrela is spot on with other wired XBOX controllers made by Microsoft. Details inside, including a full TLDR.<br /><br />▶ Hardware & Testing<br />Aside from the obvious lack of XBOX branding, the controller from Arrela is obviously a XBOX 360 controller. It has the same form factor: All buttons, analog sticks, 2.5mm headphone jack, and triggers are perfectly angled and correctly positioned. The controller also seems really well made; the tactile feedback from all the buttons, including the analog buttons, is perfect.<br /><br />Similar to Microsoft USB XBOX 360 controllers, this will work with PC and XBOX 360. On PC (Windows 10), installing drivers was effortless. My computer automatically detected the controller as an XBOX 360 controller and I was playing games on Steam in less than 5 minutes. All Steam games with controller support correctly detected the controller.<br /><br />I’ve had absolutely no problems using this controller, even when playing FPS, Racing, and Fighting games. The sensitivity of the analog sticks seemed on point, and I haven’t found any noticeable dead zones.<br /><br />▶ Final Thoughts<br />You’re getting a well-made XBOX 360 controller for a fraction of the price of a Microsoft branded controllers. It’s almost a no brainer.<br /><br />5 Stars<br />Recommended<br /><br />▶ TLDR;<br />Pros:<br />+ Controller is made very well, and tactile feedback is on point.<br />+ PC and Games automatically detect this as XBOX 360 controller.<br />+ Sensitive enough to not be a problem in FPS, Racing, and Fighting games.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Lacks XBOX Branding<br /><br />I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.

The game play reminds you a bit of Resident Evil but a bit more defined. The visual look is a bit unsatisfying and could have been better graphically. Not as scary as I hoped it'd be either. Overall though, It's not that bad of a game. 20 bucks is a fair price for it and worth checking it out for that. Not saying that it's a bad game but it is a bit flawed.	2015-08-19

I hooked this up with my XBOX One hoping it would offer sound advantage (footsteps) while playing Halo.  But it didn't.  That's probably got more to do with Halo than it does the headphones.  I am very picky about my headphones.  I used to own Bose headphones until I busted them in a Rage moment while playing an old FPS game. Sooo.....  Anyways, no more raging for me.  I  bought this when it was $120 and not the $199 price.  I will say this.  Not worth $199... or at least $199 is definitely overpriced.  The $120 during Prime Day is probably more accurate.  You're getting the $99 headphones and the (I guess $100) &#34;Audio Amplifier/Driver.&#34; I will gladly price the headphones at $99, but the audio thing...No.  It's not that great.  It's cool, but it's not that great.  Anyways, the headphones are pretty good.  They have very strong bass and sound like they have more than one speaker in each ear (supposed to be 7.1 stereo capable).  The highs aren't as impressive.  My guess is because these are gaming headphones and they need to be able to handle explosions and gun shots... not so much screaming and symbols.  Still, though, the quality of the music is how I was able to justify keeping these.  They're comfortable, they don't cause you to sweat, and they sound great.  I like that the cups swivel.  Great feature.  I will recommend these.	2015-08-19
