If you owned a PS4 or any console before, you'll notice that dust builds up quickly, and it's a hassle to clean those hard to reach places. I got this product to alleviate that problem, and it's been on my PS4 for just under two weeks, and I've already noticed it's making a big difference. It's very simple to install and occasionally you might want to unattach the railings and clean off the dust. The dust kit might look fragile, but it's actually very durable and stands up to long play sessions. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who owns a PS4. I have received this item in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-29

So here is my two cents on this product.. i previously had a type pad for my ps3 which had mechanical keys like a keyboard essentially aka hard shell keys u press on to type a letter.. however this product has a soft rubber feel on the keys.. it definitely takes some getting used to because u can't type as fast as u do like on a phone for example. So u have to slow urself down alotttt. But it does a decent job at what it's supposed to do which is type faster and easier than using a in game keyboard like when u play a mmo such as final fantasy 14 or when using the Internet on the ps4. It's a okay product but not worth the money in my eyes.	2015-08-29

Bungie has no idea on how to make a MMO. Plus 500 million dollar budget on this poor quality game. Its not even fun when you're playing with other people. The only good thing about the game is the music and visuals.<br /><br /> I did not find this fun because I had experience playing other MMOs. I think a lot of people enjoy this game because its their first MMO, and they don't have anything to compare Destiny to other relate able MMO games. That's completely understandable and hey if you have fun then that's cool.<br /><br />I recommend this game to people who never played a MMO, who don't care about story, or a serious bungie fan. But if you're like me that craves a good story in games and have experience playing MMOs then this game is not for you.	2015-08-29

Really excellent charger for Xbox One. Since i already had the charge and play kit batteries and i didn't want a charger that came with it's own batteries because usually they would go out after a while. The charger can charger two controllers at a time, also you can either plug it in to the wall or use the usb to plug it into the Xbox One itself and it could charge the controllers that way. Doesn't get the batteries hot while it's charging which is a great sign that the charger isn't damaging the battery while charging and it charges quite fast.	2015-08-29

At least in Tomb Raider Definitive Edition, you have options on how to defeat enemies. Lara's movements are multi planar, but Marius only moves 1 way. Ryse has &#34;combat&#34; button mashing, but you have to do it the same way each time practically against every enemy you face. The graphics of course are the high point of this game (just like 99% of current video games), with a story that is as transparent and 1 dimensional as water. The boss battles are EXCEPTIONALLY annoying. Be prepared to &#34;be defeated&#34; in every section of this game. This game also has the good old auto save which is now an industry standard and run of the mill rip off tool for video games these days. If you pay $60 for this game, then you should have your head examined.	2015-08-29

Helldivers is hella fun!<br />Seriously, right now, I cant think of a better co-op experience. The action is tense, the maps look cool, and the enemies are tough without being overwhelming, and even when they roll over you, the game never feels cheap. You can revive yourself as long as you are still able to crawl, a teammate can expedite the process, and if you do die, your teammates can set a beacon that revives you. There are a ton of upgrades to your weapons, special abilities (which take the form of calling in ammo, special equipment, ally revives, etc...), and so on. There are two different vehicles your team can pile into that are also armed. The missions make sense.<br />Anyway, this twin stick squad shooter basically gets everything right. You will want to play this.	2015-08-29

I even played the last amazing spiderman game and loved it. i honestly couldn't get through this game.  first the web slinging is awful.  i can't remember if they changed it from last game but now it doesn't feel smooth at all. it doesn't even seem like it works half the time. the story seems okay enough, but after you complete a mission theres a quick cutscene that does not feel fluid at all. if you compare it to other games this game wants to be, the cut scenes in those games happen within the game itself. games have improved so much that this one should be so much better than it is. i would not recommend this game, even when its on sale.	2015-08-29

Pros: They certainly look nice, and the d-pad works perfectly.<br /><br />Cons: The thumbsticks, being metal, are very slippery (even more slippery than the stock thumbsticks). The metal &#34;bullet slug' buttons stick up abnormally far from the controller and thus feel pretty wobbly.

WHEN it works. gamestream has suffered multi-day outages of its host discovery servers, and continues to do so on a regular basis. generally, every 3-4 weeks you can expect it to cut out for 2-5 days at a time. because of shockingly poor decisions on nvidia's part, this host discovery is required to stream EVEN when the shield and the host pc are on the SAME WIRED NETWORK. and even when you are able to get connected to your host pc, gamestreaming is plagued with problems: their controller emulation is woefully flawed, you can expect it to work for about 1 game in 5, because of the technical implementation. generally, you can expect most (but not all) big-budget games to look for a controller in the 'right' way that nvidia supports... otherwise, you are out of luck. this can be worked around to some extent with third-party tools, but when you consider competing products like kino console are able to provide a controller emulation layer that works 100% of the time, nvidia's inability (or refusal) to get this right is inexcusable.<br /><br />also, if you have a projection hdtv, like a dlp set, i hope you can live with having about 7% of your screen cut off on every edge, because the SATV has absolutely NO overscan correction. again, every other android-based tv device i have played with (and there have been many) includes overscan correction in its settings (including googles own android tv device), and it beggars belief that nvidia didnt include this and continues to refuse to add it.<br /><br />then there are all the other issues like the SATV being sorely lacking in audio and video codec support, having many performance glitches in the pro model owing to, evidently, poor hard drives requiring RMA, finicky peripheral connection, poor external media support, on and on it goes.<br /><br />the SATV has potential to be a great media box. someday. assuming nvidia gives it the support it needs... but if youve had nvidia android products in the past, you know how likely that is (hint: not likely at all)...<br /><br />all things considered, give this a pass. get a roku 3, and a steam link when they come out.	2015-08-29

I bought four so I could constantly have two in the controllers and two on the chargers. Im glad I did. These things do NOT hold any type of charge.

(Spoiler inside)	Ok so I bought this as a replacement for my old copy of the game. And it works well anyone who owns a psp can attest to the fact that the umd's are flimsy and can crack and or break with little force applied.  (Spoiler for ff7) But back to the game itself it picks up the story of Zack Fair the soldier operative whom Cloud thought he was. The controls are easy to use and game play isn't turn based instead you have materia shaped icons and you scroll between them for things like basic attack, magic, positions ect. Modulating is pretty much a random thing which gives you either a powerful attack or levels you up while doing a powerful attack and boosts your magic and health. Its a good change of pace and you'll find yourself unable to put down your portable or atleast that was the case for me.	2015-08-29

Additionally, I'd recommend using it with Dolphin, since direct support was recently added to this device. That would mean that you would use it in its Wii-U mode and Dolphin will process the input exactly like a Wii (U) would.<br /><br />If you're gonna use this for Super Smash Bros. Melee, you'll probably find it nice to know that no input lag is introduced when using the adapter, provided you use the aforementioned setup.<br /><br />That means no more callibration of trigger buttons or anything of the like.

I am truly amazed at what Nintendo was able to accomplish with this game on the 3DS. The game runs very smoothly. It looks like a home console release. The graphics are really impressive given what they had to work with. I got this game today, so I'll be updating when anything new comes up, but otherwise, the main part of the review will be right here.<br /><br />Gameplay: The gameplay is great. There really isn't much else to say. You beat up famous Nintendo characters, and it is some of the best fun you'll have on the 3DS. The characters play at a smooth 60fps, it really amazes me. If you get an Assist Trophy, or throw a Pokeball, the character that comes out of it will only be doing their animations at 30 frames per second. However, you really don't notice all that much, it's not like they are there for very long anyways. I believe you can customize the controls, but they are pretty much perfect as is, aside from one issue. You cannot use the d-pad to move, you can only use the circle pad. I am a d-pad kind of person when it comes to games of the fighting variety, so this is a negative for me. The d-pad is used for taunts instead.<br /><br />Story: There isn't one, much to my disappointment. I really enjoyed the Subspace Emissary of Brawl, at least what I played of it. It would be a HUGE plus if they had a story on this iteration of Smash, but that is sadly not the case. There is a lot of potential, especially with all of these new characters that have been added. This is probably three quarters of a star taken away, if not more.<br /><br />Other Modes: Normal Smash. You just fight. It sounds really boring, but just thinking about it makes me want to get off the computer, pop the cartridge in the slot and play it before finishing the review. There's a multiplayer option, but I'll get into that a bit later. There is Smash run, which is fun but a bit hard. You go around a dungeon thingy and collect powerups, then after 3 minutes you fight using those power ups. It is quite fun, and is exclusive to the 3DS version, if I am not mistaken. There is classic mode, where you choose a character and fight some pre selected enemies until you get to the final boss. Those can be difficult as well. There are a few other modes, but there are too many to get into.<br /><br />Wii U: I believe you can use the 3DS as a controller on the Wii U version of the game, but I don't own a Wii I, so I can't say anything about this.<br /><br />Streetpass: There is Streetpass functionality for this game, but I have yet to encounter a fellow Smasher on the street.,<br /><br />Online: This is where problems are...existent. There are 2 main modes: For Glory and For Fun. For Glory is where your battle stats are recorded and put in a leaderboard and all that. No items or anything like that. For Fun is just like normal Smash, but it is with online players. Smash Run can be played with LOCAL multiplayer, meaning somebody close by who also owns a copy of the game.  I only played For Fun, and boy was it hard. Not because of the fellow players and their skills, because of the RIDICULOUS lag. The lag can range from playable to 'turn the game off' bad. My first match was not possible to play. It took 30 seconds for any input I made to actually register. The worst part is that the other players seemed fine, and as a result I ended up getting ganged up on. The frames per second were so low, it looked like the world's oldest turtle was doing a slideshow of pictures from the game. The other matches were playable, but it still wasn't possible to win. It took 2 to 3 seconds for input to register, and the frames were tolerable except for a little freezing. But 2 to 3 second input lag is not acceptable when it comes to a fast paced game like Super Smash Bros. My point is: local multiplayer with somebody right next to you, you get the Wii U version.<br /><br />In short, the game is very very fun, and it is amazing what Nintendo was able to do with such limited hardware. Butfor online matches, it would be best to look at the Wii U version of the game. And there's no story mode.for online matches, it would be best to look at the Wii U version of the game. And there's no story mode.	2015-08-29

They must have played for an hour and proceeded to write their review from that. This game is awesome for the first day maybe even a few day but man does it get old QUICK. If you thought Destiny was repetitive and lacked content wait until you play this, it makes Destiny look like a top 5 all time game. This game has 0 story mode it kind of reminds me of call of duty multiplayer except worse with no campaign mode. So much day one dlc although most has nothing to do with the game you still have to pay to change colors or ad new monster/hunters and for a game lacking in content that stuff should all be free. They also might have the most DLC of all next gen games and it's all useless, instead of spending all that time making dlc they should have mad a campaign mode. At $20 I guess it's worth a try but man does it get boring fast.	2015-08-29

Glad I ignored it... Is it leaps and bounds over last year’s Madden? No. But, in my opinion, Madden 15 was a pretty solid game. Can’t say I’ve had any of the freezing or bugs others have seen in this version– and even if there are those issues, new updates will fix them… I didn’t notice any excess loading times like other reviewers suggested.<br /><br />Enhancements & Updates:<br />-Obviously, like every year, updated rosters including 2 new high profile starting rookie QBs this year<br />-New extra point rule being farther out<br />-Better passing, including a ‘touch pass’ that gets it over the LBs, but under the safeties. Also, a ‘low to the ground pass’ and a ‘shoulder pass’. Yeah, you could ‘kind of’ do it in last year’s edition (not the touch pass over the middle so much), but it feels better this year’s update.<br />-No huddle situations aren’t as ‘rushed’ for the defense where you’re on the brink of off-sides every time - like it was last year<br />-Better catching options: ‘Catch and Run’, ‘Catch and Go Down’ which helps in traffic, and ‘Aggressive / Acrobatic Catch’ (which by the way has excellent animations whether you catch the ball or not). I thought this sounded like a useless gimmick at first, but after playing it, I like it.<br />-Enhanced after play animations: you don’t have players flopping around and falling down like idiots after the play like in last year’s edition. Also, more realistic look in the way players are tackled and piled on top of each other in gang tackles.<br />-Player / Coaches faces and bodies look more realistic<br />-More realistic sideline personnel with ball-boys and extra camera crew as well as better camera angles<br /><br />Needs Improvement:<br />-Players on the sidelines without names on their jerseys?<br />-I make a field goal and no one in the crowd stands up to cheer – especially when I go up by 10 with under 2 minutes to go?<br />-Commentary, well, still is pretty boring.<br />-Occasional pixilation here and there – mostly on after play cut-scenes<br /><br />Overall:<br />Is it worth it for me? Yeah. It’s like the price of a nice meal out for 2 people… I’d prefer to have Madden 16 (over Madden 15) for a full year instead of a few drinks, wings, and an 8 oz sirloin steak at a restaurant for 1 night... But maybe that’s just me…	2015-08-29

I have to say this is my least favorite NFS game so far.<br />The game looks good on PS4, taking advantage of the new hardware and producing the best graphics in a NFS game yet. However, after just a few minutes of play I noticed glitches where textures wouldn't load in or my car would sink into the ground. That's disappointing considering this was developed by one of the richest most successful companies in the world. EA can and should do better.<br />The gameplay is fairly bland. You can play as a cop or a racer, and both offer three activities each. The lack of modes makes Rivals get stale quick.<br />As you play you earn Speed Points, which you then use to buy new cars, upgrades, weapons, etc. As a cop there's no risk of losing any points you earn, but as a racer you can and will lose all of your points often. In fact, as of this writing I have not once banked any points as a racer and thus have not been able to buy upgrades and progress in the game. The AI cops as well as the human player cops are super aggressive and without upgrades your car will be destroyed quickly. When this happens you are &#34;busted&#34; and lose your multiplier, all your Speed Points, and are booted to a long loading screen that takes you back to the garage. From there you go back to a long loading screen to return to the world and repeat. Whoever thought this was a good idea, it is not. It is the most frustrating, infuriating punishment I've had the misfortune of experiencing in a game. And I've been gaming for over 30 years.<br />If you like unfair, aggressive AI and losing over and over and having a game waste your time, buy this trash.	2015-08-29
US	2864234	R22IZ08VB2A605	B00I19TYW2	937933782	Alien: Isolation	Video Games	5	1	1	N	Y	Don't let mixed reviews scare you away.	Admittedly I ordered a copy towards the end of July almost a year after the game was originally released when I should have just gotten it when it came out. This game is a must have for any fan of the alien movies and of survival horror.  The bad about this game is that their are a few glitches and character animation issues. Although the animation issues were mainly after the update to the game also some bad voice acting from minor characters. Amanda Ripley is a believe able character and a protagonist who I was rioting for the whole way. The alien is down right terrifying as it is a constant threat and its behavior is totally random, and the detail put into it is amazing. The world is visually identical to the first alien movie which is great and the graphics are awesome and space walks are pretty memorable. The weapons are awesome and the crafting can get you out of some tricky situations involving the Xeno, the creepy androids, and survivors on Sevastopol. Ammo is scarce as it should be so its best to conserve. Fire is your only true defense against the xenomorph and moltovs and the flamethrower is super effective but ammo goes super fast. You will also be tempted to let the Xeno kill you because the death animations are really cool. The androids are really creepy since they are cheap rubber skinned knock offs of Weyland Yutani's that spout safety protocol as they try to kill you. The bolt gun is the best way to kill them but once again ammo is scarce. The sound effects and score are also great and their are lots of hacking mini games and well done audio logs from the Sevastopol and even ones recorded by the original cast of Alien. Also trophy's/ achievements can all be earned offline and are fun to earn. Another effective trick that adds to the urgency of the game is that saves are all manual so save regularly to avoid losing progress	2015-08-29

I started with games on the initial NES, continued playing with enjoying the pinnacle of the golden times of the N64. I owned a GameCube and enjoyed the little known gems of Eternal Darkness.  Owned a Wii enjoying the more casual new games of Wii Sports to the gems of Metroid Prime. This brings me to the Wii U. The high quality games aren't as abundant as have been in the past, but there are some gems, however the Wii U has some annoying problems.  First, I've always had problems getting Wifi to work. Second and more importantly, if your Gamepad that comes with the system breaks, you are close to SOL.  You can return it to Nintendo and be gouged for a repair at 2/3 cost of a new sytem, or you would think by a new gamepad, but no. Nintendo does not sell brand new gamepads. Long story short, if your gamepad breaks, which was surprisingly fragile, your systems become much more like a paper weight. I've always been a fan of Nintendo and its consoles, but do not recommend this one.	2015-08-29

Casual and hardcore fans alike will both like the highly addictive Draft Champions mode. Connected Franchise got some much needed polish and the regression and XP issues that plagued the mode last year appear to have been fully addressed. MUT continues to improve each year and looks to be ready for another stellar year.<br /><br />The new DB/WR interactions make play calling more important than ever this year. Just like in real life, if you leave a mediocre DB in one on one with a star WR, be prepared for the consequences. I did not see this as being over powered but more right where it should be to compare to the real NFL experience. Gang tackling is in the game this year and adds another level of realism as the defense reacts to the ball carrier.	2015-08-29

I was a little skeptical about buying these at first, then when they came, I put them in my controller and I can't explain how nice they are! Definitely recommend over those standard plastic analog sticks as these will take MUCH longer to wear down (If they ever decide to). Only thing I noticed when I first put them in the controller was when the shell was closed, the right analog stick didn't want to move. That was easily fixed by pushing a little harder down on them to seat them in the controller correctly, and everything was fine from there. If you're looking to replace old, worn-out analog sticks, these make excellent replacements!	2015-08-29

The color is fantastic and the setup for an import is not hard at all, as soon as you turn it on it gives you the option to set up the system in english. The X and O buttons are reversed from US playstation controls, it can be changed but if you flip the controls it will also reverse the controls when you play a US copy of a game(which load with the normal control settings of a US controller). So I just got use to using the O button to confirm in the o.s.<br /><br />I was able to easily link it to my US playstation network account and download games to play.

The same thing plagues this version of Madden that has plagued it for years, and that is this: Pre-Determined Outcomes.<br /><br />This game decides what's going to happen, you don't.  Sure, it gives you the illusion that you have control by letting you press different buttons to throw to different receivers, etc. but the game still ultimately will decide who wins or loses even if they added some new gimmicky catch buttons for receivers.<br /><br />You can have Patrick Peterson and Richard Sherman as your cornerbacks and when the CPU decides it wants to pass the ball it will.  It doesn't matter how bad the opposing QB or WR's are either, they will juke your Hall of Fame CB's out of their shoes and you'll like it.  You can blitz, drop 9 into coverage, play man, play zone, it doesn't matter.  The CPU will win if it decides it wants to.<br /><br />And in the event that you somehow do manage to manually overcome the CPU's desires, the CPU will just pull it's little trump card, the penalty.  What's that?  You finally sacked the QB on 4th and 10?  Well, turns out you face masked him in the process.  Instant first down.  Sorry bout 'cha.<br /><br />This is the single most disappointing aspect of Madden football and it remains in the game year after year after year.  It RUINS the immersion.  It RUINS the feeling that you can actually defeat your opponent through your skill.  Instead of actually programming a solid and dynamic game, the developers rely on gimmicks like that in order to make the game appear to be challenging.  Well, I'm not fooled, I can spot lazy programming when I see it.  And if you think about it, the fact that the game even has varying difficulty levels proves it.  So on the rookie setting your bad left tackle will usually whip that Pro Bowl defensive end.  On All-Madden, your Pro Bowl left tackle will get dominated by a scrub.  What's the point of player attributes again?  Player attributes alone should determine the difficulty.  Build a crappy team, you're going to have a harder time.  Build a good team, and the game will be easier.  This isn't rocket science.<br /><br />I've known about pre-determined outcomes in Madden for a while and I still bought the game because I like to play franchise mode and pretend I'm a GM.  Having said that, there are a few changes to this year's franchise mode.<br /><br />You still spend scouting points on players, but instead of having the ability to unlock an actual attribute as a number, you instead are only allowed to see a letter grade for that player's 3 most important attributes.  At the scouting combine, you'll gain access to their measurables.  So you no longer need to spend scouting points to see what their speed is, if you saw that they ran a 4.28 forty then you know their speed is good.  If you saw that they did 45 reps on the bench press you know their strength is good, etc.<br /><br />So that part's a little different from years' past.  It adds a little more guesswork to your drafting than before since you can't unlock the numerical attribute, but for the most part you can spot a bust before you spend that draft pick on him.<br /><br />Trade logic appears to have improved some.  In years past CPU teams would trade good young players for 1st round picks which made no sense.  It seems teams value their good young players a little more now and won't so readily trade them only to try to draft another good young player to replace him.<br /><br />Other than that, it's the same old Madden.  Good graphics?  Sure.  Fancy presentation?  You bet.  An enjoyable and realistic simulation of NFL football?  Not a chance.  Madden hasn't really changed since 08 and it never will until they throw their entire code away and start from scratch.  And to do it right would take a few years.  Well EA's not going to go years without putting a yearly Madden on the shelves, there's too much money to be made.  Instead they'll update the rosters, tack on a few new gimmicks (this year's new gimmickis the different catch options for receivers) spend exorbitant amounts of money marketing it and laugh all the way to the bank.  EA still has exclusivity with the NFL, so until we as the consumers stop giving them our money (I was guilty this year but hadn't bought once since Madden 11) then nothing will ever change.is the different catch options for receivers) spend exorbitant amounts of money marketing it and laugh all the way to the bank.

I only have a few real complaints about the game. First, I can't stand Phil Simms as the announcer. I like the guy as a quarterback, but his voice and comments are just headache inducing. I never realized how much I liked John Madden until I've had several years of Phil Simms (no disrespect). Second, navigating menus and different game modes can be rather slow at times. I feel like literally everything has to load and the load times can be painfully annoying. It's nit picky, I know. Third, the new method of catching balls can be kinda comical and ridiculous. I've had instances were you throw a bullet across the middle and some random low ranked Linebacker makes a one handed interception! Or you throw a lob pass and your receiver makes some hug leaping one handed catch (like the one Odell Beckham Jr made). These catches are once in a life time, but now in Madden 16, they can be rather common. It's a video game, I get it. I'm nit picking. It's a fun and enjoyable game at the end of the day. Worth $40 for sure.	2015-08-29

I was easily involved in the story and presentation. Outstandingly beautiful. Gameplay ranges from tense to punishing, It is almost like a zombie Metal Gear Solid in that there are multiple ways and routes to pass a zone, from stealth to guns blaring. Compelling voice acting in the cutscenes is well done. Normal difficulty was challenging. Greater difficulty can become downright maddening, Many collectible flesh out story. First playthrough took about 20 hours but I did a good job of exploring and taking in the very, very pleasing scenes and color palette. Replay revolves mostly around collectibles and difficulty, meh. I would absolutely recommend this game.	2015-08-29

US	554437	R1T6U2ZTAVYG9T	B00ZMBLKPG	966892383	Gears of War: Ultimate Edition - Xbox One	Video Games	1	6	44	N	N	A massive waste of time	I remember buying an xbox 360 and gears of war almost a decade ago. I remember it being the reason sony lost the console war. Gears of war trashed resistance fall of man. Back then, the graphics, gameplay, physics, and even the AI, story, and characters, were all strikingly new and fresh. Of course, you can't praise gears' story and characters without getting mocked, but I remember being interested in the main character, imprisoned for desertion/treason by the coalition of organized governments, who is then freed out of desperation as humanity runs out of soldiers.<br /><br />The city you explore is one that fell during Marcus' incarceration.  The court that convicted him has been abandoned to the locust, and the people who convicted him are either dead or evacuated.  Awesome.<br /><br />What's special about it, is that he never turns his back on humanity. &#34;i'm not doing this for you&#34;.<br /><br />I still love hearing Marcus Fenix voice.  It's got that movie magic to it, and it's an strong now as it was then.  The haunting song &#34;14 years after E day&#34; still perfectly helps set the dark tone of the game.  The sound design is still king.<br /><br />Everything about it felt next gen, aside from the laggy, host advantage peer to peer online gameplay. One shotgun roller was in a class of his own, and you just had to hope it was you, or at least that he was on your team.<br /><br />Much of it has aged.  Most of it poorly.  You basically move from cover to cover, shooting enemies, for hours on end with very little else happening to break up the monotony.<br /><br />The time and effort they put into reskinning this game could have been invested in a brand new game entirely, a new story, new characters, Hell, maybe even a brand new franchise.<br /><br />It feels like the only reason this game exists is to make money. Fans of the franchise, like me, already played gears of war multiple times back when it was new.<br /><br />I just fail to grasp the concept here. What were they thinking?<br /><br />It's ironic because the problems with gears of war were obviously never it's graphics. So they tried to fix the graphics. wtf?<br /><br />Why remake a decade old game without changing anything but the graphics? Who was like 'gears of war will sell copies once we fix the graphics'  lol...  who greenlit this project?<br /><br />It's painful how repetitive the game feels today. The whole production feels small now. It lacks the spectacle and scope of gears 2, the jaw dropping set pieces... I remember how satisfied I was to roll, roadie run, slide into and mantle over cover, stop and pop, back when I'd never done it before. But now we've all been doing this for 4 games. 4 Gears of War games, and now they try to get people to pay 40$ to replay the original? How many cover shooters have we played since then? Over and over and over and over, and now go back to the very first that got it right. And they want 40 dollars to do that?  And Microsoft wonders why they're losing this generation.  The asking price is an insult to fans of the franchise.  Gears 3 cost less at launch.<br /><br />Videogames, and even the gears of war franchise, have come a long way in the last 10 years. This remake hasn't.<br /><br />Gears, Grand Theft Auto, and  Uncharted, three of the highest reviewed franchises in existence, have been cranking out cover shooters for 9 years, and things have changed.<br /><br />Is Microsoft even going to try to beat Sony?  This isn't the way.  I also fail to see how this fits into Microsoft's arsenal of exclusive games.  What PS4 owner is going to say to themselves &#34;Gears of War one for 40 bucks?  I'm buying and Xbox One!&#34;  Nobody is going to say that.  When you look back at the megahits that shaped the Xbox brand, they were halo, Halo 2, and Gears of War.  Where does Gears of War Ultimate at this price point fit into the picture.  No where.  It's a huge misstep that fans of the franchise are never going to forget, and PS4gamers aren't going to care about.  You're either being insulted, or you just don't care.<br /><br />What we should have gotten, was a compilation of gears 1, 2, and 3 in 1080p and 60fps for 10$ or so.<br /><br />Also, the reskin doesn't look that much different than the original. If your'e going to reskin an entire game, shouldn't you be aiming for a completely different look? I mean, if you're trying to maintain the look, feel, and tone of the original, why the hell reskin it? Gears Ultimate wouldn't even look like the original if I had my way. You wouldn't even be able to recognize it. But not so, you always know exactly where you are, because you can always recognize the geometry and the colors and textures that look very similar. I never ever felt lost in a new game world. It's a testament to how iconic the original is/was, and yet another reason this game should never have been made.<br /><br />I'm not even sure if the remaster looks better than the original.  I know it doesn't look as good as Gears 4.<br /><br />Everytime I play Gears Ultimate, I wish I was playing Gears 4 instead.<br /><br />I should be able to easily see the graphical improvements given it's on a next gen console, but the only thing I'm sure of is that it's running at a higher resolution.  Big deal.  Higher res graphics do not always translate into better graphics.<br /><br />Gears of War's graphics were a masterpiece then, and in my eyes they still are.  It's a classic.  No need for a reskin.  It's the rest of the game that's the problem.<br /><br />Ultimate's graphics style is like  &#34;imagine if we made gears of war look more like every other game on the market&#34;.  It just feels bland and uninspired, like no one had a clear vision of what the game should be, and that's something gears of war never lacked, vision.  I think that's why this remake is such a failure.  It lacks the vision and sense of purpose of the original.<br /><br />I do not personally feel that the new textures look better all the time.  They usually have higher resolution, yes, but there are many times when I wonder if the original's graphics are superior.<br /><br />It does not look worse than the original, but I feel that most times it just looks a little different.  The plastic sheen on characters faces is lessened, and I agree that this might be somewhat of an improvement. I honestly feel like there should be no contest between this next gen remake and the original.  Gears Ultimate should be flat out wasting Gears one, and it doesn't.  It should be blatantly obvious which game looks better.  I don't really blame the artists for this.  There wasn't much room for improvement to begin with.<br /><br />Another irony. Microsoft needed gears of war last generation, needed a way to beat Sony. Yet again, Microsoft needs another gears of war, another way to beat sony. And here it is. haha. It's just like microsoft to crank out a game like this, especially for this price.<br /><br />They've finally stopped reselling us windows over and over, and started reselling us gears.<br /><br />What if instead of making this, they had made a prequel to Gears of War, where you start as Fenix fighting in the pendulum wars, then Emergence Day happens, and you attempt to repel the locust invasion.  Fight at asypho fields and see what happened there.  That would have been awesome.<br /><br />Or what if they retold Gears of War one in an alternate reality?  What if they decided to break Fenix out of prison against the cog's wishes?  What if you fought through the city as it was falling, rather than after it had fallen?<br /><br />Or what if everything had been redesigned, so it's the same exact story, but the shape and look of everything is different.  The prison and everthing else is designed differently, and all the boss fights redone with a different strategy to beat each?  So the plot is exactly the same but everything else is new?<br /><br />So many possibilities.  So many wasted opportunities.<br /><br />Gears of War 1 is simply a poor candidate for this kind of remaster. It was more about doing things 'new' than doing things well. More about revolution than evolution. It's a game that demanded sequels, demanded a franchise, demanded the creation of a new genre, and that genre has been in constant flux, constant evolution since then. Virtually almost everything about the original no longer holds up,  and now visually, it looks more like every other videogame than gears of war.  I shake my head at all this. Have the games graphics aged? Yes, a bit, and it's noticeable, but as I said before, so has everything else in the game, and they didn't see the need to fix any of that.<br /><br />Gears of war wasn't just a next gen game. it was a next gen franchise. An IP born at the start of the next generation. It took advantage of all the capabilities of the xbox 360. The entire game streamed right off the disc. There were no loading times unless you died. Each soldier in your squad had their own uniquely designed and textured in high definition armor. Weapons like the sub machine gun assault rifle chainsaw combo lancer, the hammer of dawn firing burning lasers from the sky, all the different locust enemies you'd never seen before, the 'destroyed beauty' art style. Getting downed from taking damage and hoping a teamate would revive you before you got curb stomped. It was a rush of new, burning passion. And that deserves another new game, with the same drive to take us new places and show us new things. Not a reskin.<br /><br />I am glad that they have finally fixed the multiplayer with dedicated servers, but its 10 years too late.  I remember how disappointed I was trying to play the original online.  Emptying entire clips into enemies and not killing them, instantly dying from a shotgun running host.  It was miserable.  The online was really the only thing about the game that didn't work.  I remember how stoked I was to get into multplayer, and damn, was it a massive let down.  Gear one was basically unplayable.<br /><br />You know, thinking back to Gears one reminds me of the achievement &#34;always remember your first&#34; that you earn after your first chainsaw kill. &#34;always remember your first&#34;.... can any gamer forget the first time they played gears of war? What a rush. What I want, is the next gears of war. The next shocking new experience that I'll never forget.<br /><br />*update -  I've now completely finished the campaign, and I have very little to add except that I was exhausted and grateful when the train ride was over.  Memorable moments like blowing up chaps gas station are ruined by some of the fakest looking explosions I have ever seen.  I also noticed that many character models look worse than they did in the original.  I played most of the game coop as the host, and it was, at least on my end, a lag free experience.  AI Dom kept getting cornered and killed by the bezerker over and over again.<br /><br />I still feel that the game makes a mistake by not letting you rescue civilians.  there's a sense that there's nothing left to fight for or protect because the game is lacking in interesting and likeable characters aside from dom and the main protagonist, but it's realistic that there's nobody left to defend in a city that fell to the locust long ago.<br /><br />The added brumak fight is anticlimactic and boring, just like I remember it from the pc version.  The brumak is supposed to be scary, but the dialogue and actions of your squad diminish that fear completely.<br /><br />On the multiplayer side of things, the lack of lag online has made super weapons incredibly dangerous, and all of them are easy to use.  I don't like weilding them.  It feels like cheating.  Epic should have rebalanced these weapons but they didn't.  I do not like exploiting the flaws in the system, it feels like i'm taking advantage of other people.  But you can't just let the enemy capture them, or else you're sure to loseevery match.  Simply put, the grenade, boomshot and torque bow are game breaking flaws, and to a lesser extent, so is the longshot.<br /><br />Of course, you have the option of 2v2 gnasher shotgun matches, but I don't want to play 4 player games.  I have no idea why there isn't a 4v4 gnasher mode.  perplexing and irritating.<br /><br />Grenades make a small explosion compared to their max effective range.  Most of the time I never even see the blast, my body just disappears into a few chunks of meat for no reason.  Grenade area of effect is absolutely insane and needs to be reduced immediately.<br /><br />The biggest problem with multiplayer is that you can't see the crosshairs of your shotgun without aiming down your sites.  It's a problem, because identifying exactly where the center of the screen is at while moving, watching your teamates moving, and watching your enemies moving all at the same time, is very difficult.<br /><br />This is a problem that existed 10 years ago, and it still exists today.  Players are forced to tape crosshairs onto their televisions so they can blind fire the shotgun and hit their targets.  It's the only way to compete, but I refuse to do it because I know that there are other players like me who are against cheating.<br /><br />The result is a game that is unplayable.<br /><br />You can't aim with your shotgun without slowing down, which makes you an easy target.  You also can't instantly aim and have crosshairs appear, it takes precious milliseconds.  The best way to die against a player who has taped crosshairs onto their screen is to attempt to aim at them.  You become a large, motionless target.<br /><br />Of course, epic could easily patch the problem and give everyone with the shotgun blind fire crosshairs, but out of what I imagine to be sheer laziness, they haven't.<br /><br />Epic :  I am not going to tape crosshairs to my TV.

Missed a ton of stuff (apparently) and got a couple people killed due to a toy from my son hitting the couch when I was to remain completely still and any SLIGHT movement meant death. This game is freaking amazingly done and completely nailbiting. I highly recommend this game as it is an edge of your seat thriller that has an amazing story line and even better plot development (that is solely based on how you handle different scenarios). Every action you take or words you decide to say have an everlasting effect on the remainder of the story. Lots of recognizable actors and it made me jump more than any movie I have ever watched.<br /><br />Watching the behind the scenes and R and D they put into this game made it even more enjoyable to play.	2015-08-29

Upon getting it, saw that it has firmware 3.10 on it and it said that a firmware update was needed. Proceeded with the firmare update and selected that English to be displayed on the main menu. Checking out the Japanese PSN store, there are numerous Japanese region Vita, PS1 game titles and PSP titles that are downloadable but the movies and anime DL selection are a bit sorely lacking (there is a more robust selection of movies to d/l on the USA region PSN site indeed). Does have an internal 1GB of memory for Vita games, Vita game demos, Vita game updates & FMV clips d/l'ed off the JPN region PSN site (but that isn't user accessible once you insert a Vita memory card). The use of an optional 64GB sized Vita memory card works like a charm on the Vita TV micro-console (it'll say that 60GB are available for use once properly formatted upon inserting it for the first time). However, if you insert a Vita memory card associated with a USA region PS Vita user account, it'll say that the content isn't compatible for use with the Vita TV console and if you wish to use it, delete the content so that it may be reformatted to be used properly.<br /><br />What's cool is that if you have a Japanese PS3 user account set up on your PS3 gaming console, any of the Vita game demos, Vita game FMV clips & Japanese region PSP game demos that you've previously downloaded off of the Japanese PSN site and saved to the PS3's HDD, they can be transferred to the Vita TV micro-console's internal 1GB memory or saved to an inserted Vita memory card via USB 2.0 link cable setup -- how cool is that?<br /><br />Of course, considering that this particular Vita TV micro-console is just the system itself, a supplied AC adapter, and included HDMI cable -- noDual Shock 3 controller is supplied whatsoever and one will have to sourced to be utilized when powered on.<br /><br />Makes an ideal companion piece to your existing Japanese region Vita gaming handheld.	2015-08-29

I was having too much fun with Nintendo’s new ip when it first came out to write any review! So decided to write one now after trying all of the game’s features. Didn’t have any issues with online multiplayer. Octo valley is fun. Love the colors! Vibrant. Gameplay is fun. It’s actually is enjoyable to play. I prefer using wiimote controls to play this game.<br /><br />Transform into a squid when needed. Blast others with ink. Neat idea! Only thing I wish it had more options for single player. I like the notion of identifying with animals in a game which is pretty neat. Nintendo tends to do that with many of it’s games (Zelda, Marios, Donkey Kong, Deep Ocean to name a few). I can play Splatoon with others than me without having to worry about an over saturated amount of violence. I also now have a better appreciation for squids. Feel like painting some wall somewhere with bright colors after playing Splatoon.<br /><br />Try this out:<br />Play Splatoon in your backyard in 480p (some resolutions are still better for certain things) with color saturation settings set to max next to a waterslide when it’s hot out. Works well for me!	2015-08-29

We purchased this solely for our younger daughters to use with their Just Dance games.  Camera picks their movements up just fine.  Is it exact...no, but being that they no longer have to hold a controller when dancing, makes this not such a big deal.  Our major complaint with this camera in general, is the cord that you have to connect into the Playstation  is super short.  When my husband went to Best Buy to purchase another identical one to make it longer, they told him only the manufacturer makes it and it would need to be ordered through them, online.  When we received the additional cord, it didn't fit into the original cord to extend it.  Come to find out, others have had the same issue and have posted on forums online that there is no way to extend the length of the cord at this time.  Major bummer if you're Playstation is hooked up on the other side of the room, such as if you have a media room for this kind of hobby.  We ended up having to move the entire Playstation closer to our screen, which then meant we needed to make other cords not related to this camera, longer.  More extensions needed.  Kind of a pain if you only plan on using this for Just Dance games.	2015-08-29

These LED strip lights are a great way to highlight a Computer case. You can purchase longer strips, or connect two or more of these smaller strips together with supplied connectors. The lighting is quite bright. I have one set that is now about 4 years old, and they have not dimmed out, at least not from my own perspective, and that is with high hour usage. The strips have an adhesive backing on them. Once in a while, you might get an &#34;old&#34; set, that was in storage awhile, as the adhesive backing comes off of the strip. On an occasion or two, I have had to supply my own industrial double backed tape to mount these. The connectors are of decent quality, with plenty of wire to reach around your case with. I have also installed these around the I/O ports on the back of the computer, to give illumination for when you are plugging or unplugging components into the computer so you do not need a flashlight. Make sure you protect the wires from any sharp edges inside the computer case. Now go have fun!	2015-08-29

The audio quality is great though, which makes it a shame that these 2 issues really bring down the whole product.	2015-08-29

The layout for France is beautifully done. The open world concept is engaging and there are so many facets and different ways to play, it will keep you engaged for hours upon hours. The main story line is brilliant and your side jobs, or co-op missions are excellent. You have heist missions, murder mysteries, and Nostradamus symbols to unlock. You develop assassin skills through creed points in this game, and your level of assassin is only maintained by accumulating points by playing the game. Definitely recommend this game, and the Dead kings option as an add on to the game. It opens up a whole new story for Arno (main character) to play.	2015-08-29

As a casual gamer, this game system is satisfactory, such that it's 500 GB hard drive is more than enough to store my game data, videos, and music. It's super slim design makes for easy placement anywhere in my home where there's a TV. Plus, it is said to use less energy than it's preceding version, the PS3 slim version usually holding an average 250 GB. It shows, as older models tend to fire off like a heating system or an air conditioner after moderate to heavy use. There are no signs of the console burning out, even after several hours of gameplay. (Note: extend the longevity of your game system by not using it so often, you all know the drill.) I keep some space open around my console so it doesn't overheat. The price of the console when I bought it reflected well for my budget too, as I saw it as less than a dollar for every gigabyte storage in the console's hard drive. All in all, if you want the ultimate gaming experience without paying an arm and a leg for the newer PS4, buy this PS3. Even with changes in its design -- there is a hatch covering any inserted game disc that can be opened by pressing the eject button adjacent to the power button on the front -- the console functions in the same capacity as its older models. Some may see this as a downgrade from what is featured with the older models, but it's really of no consequence to me. It enhances that DVD/Blu-Ray kind of feel for me when inserting discs into the the console. Good price for a good device, and well worth the investment… if it doesn't burn out and experience that yellow light of death often seen with the &#34;fat&#34; models.	2015-08-29

First off, I rented this from Redbox. It took me roughly 7 and a half hours on my first run, mainly because I was looking for every clue and totem in the game. Since the game is essentially like a playable movie, I would say even if you &#34;speed ran&#34; the game it would still take you 4-5 hours because you cannot skip scenes. This game is awesome! If you are a fan of horror movies, this is definitely a homage to them. The overall graphics, score and atmosphere is excellent. The characters are great cliche's of their horror movie counterparts and at first I was wanting pretty much all of them to die, but as the game developed I began routing for most of them.The plot is broken into a prologue, 10 story chapters and an epilogue. The plot itself is fairly predictable, but does have a few effective twists in the last quarter of the game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Horror/Slasher genre is on point!<br />-Visually this game is stunning, especially the lighting effects.<br />-Hayden Panettiere, Peter Stomare, Rami Malek and Brett Dalton are superb. The rest of the cast is great, but not standouts.<br />-The story was very unique (surprisingly) and had unforeseen twists.<br />-A LOT to discover everywhere you go<br />-Characters (other than Emily, Matt & Jessica) have growth over the entire story arc<br />-The game truly has multiple endings<br />-You can determine who from the group lives and dies by your actions<br />-Controls are simplistic and work well with the game-type<br />-Cinematography is eerily effective<br />-Ability to revisit chapters to complete collection of clues & totems<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cannot skip cut scenes (mainly for re-playing chapters for trophy hunting)<br />-Takes a few hours for the story to &#34;take off.&#34;	2015-08-29

Better once he's upgraded of course.  I prefer rocket path over bomb buddies.  The big bonus of getting kick-off countdown over reg. Countdown is he is a special version  (generally a stat boost for special skylanders).. but the big bonus of special swap force skylanders such as kick off countdown,  Easter version of trigger happy & Jolly bumble blast is that their stat boosts come in the form of a hat u can use on any skylander. That's a huge improvement from previous game offerings. These guys r worth it for their fabulous hats & good news is, they're generally very inexpensive, as opposed to some other special versions like nitro or legendary which do not give u special hats. I got kick off countdown new for $1.99. Jolly Bumble blast pre owned for a few bucks & same w/ Easter version of trigger happy.  So that adds to the beauty of these 3 special guys. I use kick off hat & jolly hat the most. Great stats. Triple boost from all 3 hats. I know soccer hat is speed, critical hit & health & jolly hat is speed, armor & health.  Good #'s too. Can't remember spring time hat boosts but nice #'s on that too.<br /><br />  For ppl mentioning open pkg's.. while some may b from jerks who opened, be aware that skylander pkgs r not all that sturdy & often fall apart in stores.. I have purchased some as gifts & cover fell off b4 I could give gift. It's actually pretty common. If they don't work, u should absolutely exchange them tho. No reason u should b stuck w/ a non working item. Amazon will exchange, if seller gives u hard time, contact<br />Amazon directly. Gamestop, walmart, best buy all exchange if purchased there too. If u run into trouble contact Activision for replacement but it's obviously much easier thru store or Amazon if possible.  Hope this helps.	2015-08-29

I recently bought this game for a relatively cheap price to see how the game was for myself so here it is. For starters I want to say that when you play this for the first time, it's ridiculously difficult to even try and set up a match. Finally once you've managed to get past the annoying superstar selection screen, you get to choose from 7 different areas to fight your opponent in that include a truck arena, the locker rooms, the loading bay, bathrooms, the block, the parking garage, and the media center. The only available area upon first playing the game is the truck arena. All other areas must be unlocked, but I'll get to that in a moment.  Backstage Assault has a fairly large roster containing most--if not all of the WCW superstars that were on TV in 1999 and 2000. It was also the first game to feature WCW women as default characters on the roster, making it one of the largest rosters in WCW's gaming history. Among the stars and women in this game include Goldberg, Sting, Hulk Hogan, Jeff Jarrett, Major Gunns, Sid Vicious, Mona, Booker T, DDP, Kimberly, Rey Mysterio, Torrie Wilson, Scott Steiner, Miss Hancock, Vince Russo, Bret Hart, and many more. Of course with men and women on the roster, that also meant you could do several intergender matches. Want Goldberg to lay a beatdown on Major Gunns? You can make it happen. Want Torrie Wilson to beat Scott Steiner into submission? Go for it!  There are only 3 different matches to play. You can choose between regular, First Blood, or Human Torch. Regular and First Blood are pretty self-explanatory, while the Torch Match involves you having to set your opponent on fire to win the match.  There are 2 different features to play in this game that include Hardcore Challenge Mode and Hardcore Gauntlet. Hardcore Challenge Mode was pretty much similar to Mayhem's Quest For The Best Mode, only you were fighting backstage. The premise of Hardcore Challenge Mode involves you choosing a WCW superstar and playing as them through a series of backstage matches as you vie for the Hardcore, US, and World Titles. Along the way, with each match you win, you'll unlock new fighting areas, new weapons, and new women and superstars to play as.  Hardcore Gauntlet sees your superstar fight 7 other opponents in back to back matches with no time to rest or recover. If you lose a match, you can't replay it and will have to start all over again. And when the smoke clears, if you've managed to overcome and prevail in both the Hardcore Gauntlet and Hardcore Challenge Mode, then you just may find yourself among the top 10 in the Hall of Champions.  Now for the final part; gameplay. Gameplay pace moves at a similar, decent pace as it did in Mayhem. The only problem with the game is how unbelievably difficult it becomes to keep your opponent down for a 3 count. Seriously, I played a match with Goldberg against Jeff Jarrett and after nearly 5 minutes of constantly driving Jarrett into the concrete and beating him senseless with nearly every weapon in sight, he still continued to kick out every time I pinned him, time and time again. Now I'm all for a challenge, but having your opponent no-sell your attacks isn't a challenge, it's just annoying. The thing that really turns me away from the gameplay is the cheesy effects added to it. If you ever low blown an opponent, you'll be met with a cheesy boink sound effect or whistle sound effect. Like why? Just why? And of course, to call the action for WCW's last video game is Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan.   Overall: For WCW's final video game, this wasn't all it could've been. Somewhere, some genius back in 2000 thought it'd be a great idea to completely toss out the wrestling ring and have nothing but backstage fighting. While on paper it may have sounded like a good idea, actually going through with it wasa mistake as fighting backstage in every match gets old really quick. Kind of like most things on WCW television during the time this game came out, Backstage Assault took something cool and ran it into the ground until the point it was no longer something interesting or fun. Had they kept the in-ring aspect in this game and worked on adding other features, then this could've been a really great game. Something not many know is that a follow up to Backstage Assault was being planned but it would be called Mayhem 2. So it was ultimately a sequel to Mayhem but had the same concept as Backstage Assault. Set for a Playstation 2 release in October 2001, it looked to be the greatest WCW game never made. Mayhem 2 would still take place backstage, but with a Def Jam like theme with bigger and larger areas to fight in and even a story mode with branching stories. Unfortunately because WCW went out of business in March 2001, the game never made it past its early developing stage. Instead, we're left with this average, somewhat forgettable game that is Backstage Assault to put the exclamation point on WCW's video games. Overall, Backstage Assault is a decent game. It's fun to finally get to play as the women of WCW as well as play as a lot of the popular stars that were in WCW during that time, but after 7 or 8 matches, the game loses its flavor and becomes bland and lackadaisical. If you're a big fan of WCW and/or its video games, then give this a try; otherwise, just settle for Smackdown 2 Know Your Role--which outshone this game when it came out just weeks after Backstage Assault	2015-08-29

Let me first say that after having played madden 15 which was a very discouraging undertaking on many levels, I cancelled my pre-order for 16!<br />However, wanting to play football, I said to myself, well let's see what happens with 16!.<br />For some reason, it seems sacrilegious for EA sports to give us the consumers who purchase its sports games a blessing without adding a curse!<br />Don't get me wrong, I like what they have done to Madden 16! I just don't like the way they did it.<br />The running game is an impossibility with the exception of a few plays that actually work because within the new animations, the offense moves at an almost snails pace in play action which allows the defense to pounce before the quarterback can hand the ball off. In addition, the defense on running plays lives in the backfield because the block is very stagnant and doesn't resemble they way the pros run block from an offensive line point of view.  With regards to passing, it's actually fun, however, if the receiver doesn't catch the ball after you have gone for the aggressive catch, there will be most like an interception. If you somehow overthrow a wide open target, there will be most likely an interception. When I play games against the computer as I have been lately using the Seahawks against the Chargers on All Madden Level I have been getting beat almost everytime because the offensive line blocking doesn't hold up. My QB has gotten sacked consecutively so fast  at the snap of the ball  that it happens within the blink of an eye and leaves me asking what just happened! Rarely does this happen in professional football in this manner!<br />One other thing that I wish EA would change. Football is a natural game played in natural way. This game is not fully natural the way shooting games are. I don't like the fact that the QB is sacked when a defender is with 5-7 yards. The QB, it seems cannot complete the natural throwing motion which you and I would be able to do in similar situations! The QB has to have a throwing radius of 180 degrees. EA falls short in this aspect because it allows the position of the defenders to dictate the accuracy of the throw!<br /><br />Lastly, there are three things to look forward to in this addition of Madden;<br /><br />1.Exhilarating long distance catches...the QB can actually throw the ball above defenders...(hope they never stop this feature)<br />2. More interceptions because of the new wr/db interactions<br />3. More sacks because the O-line blocking should have been better!<br /><br />Finally!, there is still room for improvement and it looks like EA is on the right track with this addition of Madden.<br />The question is, how long will it be before we get a simulated football game that can do everything?	2015-08-29

No I'm not a fake this game sucks so bad they changed the passing to make it way to easy for good receivers to make catches with the aggressive catch option trust me this game is so bad and on count of that u can't even skip cutscenes and replay the game takes forever to be done with it because of it. Do not get this game I'm getting Fifa instead which I get every year and at least u can skip the replays and they don't make drastic changes to something that shouldn't have been touched oh and they made passing the option to throw high and low with buttons I don't get it they say it's a new feature when last year with the right analog u can do it and can I say it was much easier this game sucks madden never improves I'm fed up with it I don't even watch soccer but Fifa is a great fricken game not this garbage the announcers haven't changed any of their words from last year same crap! Once you see passing is impossible to defend you will send it back also	2015-08-29

I bought one hoping to get back into my DDR prime days and this thing is nothing but disappointment.  I ordered the first one, and it shipped just fine, however after plugging it in and playing I realized that the left arrow did not function.  Not just it missed from time to time.  It did not function AT ALL!  I contacted the seller and shipped it back for a exchange.  After getting the exchange I plugged that one in and it played just fine,  FOR ONE DANG PLAY SESSION!  It then promptly did the exact same thing and the top arrow and left arrow did not function at all. It has to be either cheap wiring or cheap sodding of the sensor bars.  But either way, it is supremely frustrating as a old time DDR player that cannot make their own metal pad to play at home.  Find better pad (which is unlikely)  or find ways of making one yourself and save yourself the pain and hundreds of dollars that I've just gone through.	2015-08-29

Got it relatively quick but was surprised by it.  No directions for applying, but common sense will help out.  Thick  vinyl stickers, with a solid adhesive.  Once applied it's not coming off.  However if feeling the need to remove, it could easily.  You could apply over them also without removal if needed. About the graphic its self. Quality, crisp and clear.  Obviously designed for the box. The mural on the back is a hoot to look at up close as it's got alot of the star wars universe ships forming an awesome mosaic.  The ghost vader on the front, obviously is meant to be the center piece and unless you have the stand you'll not be able to see the pics on both sides. I like the mosaic side better, however.. Whether is was meant to be or not, when the ps4 led lights up (power up, stand by etc.) the positioning makes it look like a light saber. In the dark it's extremely cool looking.  Too bad you cannot adjust the led colors of the unit itself for red!  How cool is that.  Without a close up from the seller and on a whim, I am extremely glad I got it.  Star wars fans love it and comment on it when they see it.  Looks like a special edition ps4 unit.	2015-08-29

It's worth it. For me it was really what games were on it or going to be on it. A lot of the games I like are PS only.<br /><br />It was funny though, game stop doesn't whip the hard drive, so the one I got had TONS of downloaded games I could play.

With Rock Band 4 destined to be released in a couple months, I figured that I may as well give my thoughts on Rock Band 3.......for the Nintendo DS! So not only do we have a Rock Band game on the PSP and a conversion of Lego Rock Band for the DS, but we also get a version of the numbered sequel on the go! While certain home-to-small-screen transitions of video games have been handled as half-hearted cash grabs, others give the handhelds a complementary experience, and that's exactly what Rock Band 3 provides.<br /><br />If you've played the other portable Rock Bands before, you'll know what to expect from this one. If not, don't worry; I got ya covered. Unlike the Guitar Hero games on DS, you don't need a peripheral to play this game, so not only is it less expensive to boot, but it can even be played on a Nintendo DSi or 3DS. Instead, you play using the DS's own buttons. The A, B, Y, and X buttons are all for hitting the notes (they are assigned to the specific colors of course). The unique difference (between consoles and DS anyway) is that you gain control of all four instruments, each with their own layouts of notes, and you must hop around to use them via the L and R buttons. To do well at earning stars on your performance, you must react quickly when one instrument's note layouts ends and another starts up next to you and keep hitting the notes without missing one for note streaks. And of course, the mic can be used to double your scores temporarily (a la Guitar Hero's Star Power)<br /><br />All things considered, the resulting rhythm gameplay is neat and addicting. Playing songs, especially on difficulties like Hard mode, make the game fast-paced and the combo-triggering can make for a good motivation to try and keep at it. The music selection amounts to a healthy 25 songs, and most of them are goodies I'd be happy to jam to. I actually like this game more than I do Lego Rock Band, because not only are the graphics much more interesting to look at, but what I wasn't so fond of in Lego was that you were able to stick with one instrument during gameplay, and if you do that, you'd just experience repetitive rows of notes throughout the song. Here, Rock Band 3 requires that you keep going and help the entire band stay on their feet, especially considering not taking part in the other note tracks would mean the other instruments may end up in desperate need to survive with the whole band. It keeps gameplay NOT repetitive by making use of all four note tracks instead of making that an option. And as far as I can tell, the campaign isn't rehashing songs as much as Lego Rock Band's.<br /><br />It's Rock Band on the DS made more fun than before, and for that I wholeheartedly recommend this game to rhythm game fans, and for those interested in playing a Rock Band game, but don't feel like going through the tedium and spending of buying each peripheral. It's inexpensive, portable, and a great play. Now if only there was a 3DS version of Rock Band 4.wasn't so fond of in Lego was that you were able to stick with one instrument during gameplay, and if you do that, you'd just experience repetitive rows of notes throughout the song.

US	3407357	RKUYUXCUW6U	B0132BDUAU	361457716	TNTi&trade; T-1200 Controller Core - Xbox One Rechargeable Battery with Play and Charge Power Cable	Video Games	5	5	6	N	N	Charge Up Quick	So most of you who have some game console know that you always need a extra battery pack of some sort to keep you able to play your games for all day. I'm sure many of you use lots of batteries if you have kids who play the game all day. But now you might have a solution to this issue of yours and you won't have any MISSING batteries.<br /><br />When I tried this charger out the remote control was completely dead. I placed the battery into the controller and let me tell that it has a lot of power because it has been two days and the controller is still rolling.  I usually go through packs of batteries in a week which costed me money I don't have to be wasting. We go through so many batteries because we play like almost day since it's summer and there's not much to do. The kids also cause me a high light bill too. I like that when the battery dies you could use the USB wire cable as a a wired controller too. Since the wire reaches 9 feet  long this is awesome too because you sit from the tv and still play. You can also use the charger while it's charging but I don't do that because I don't want to mess up the charger. When I went to charge it the charging only took a little over 2 hours to fully charge. I would definitely recommend this charger because it works great with the Xbox one control and it's worth the price.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All words are my own.	2015-08-29

Syncs fast via bluetooth. Very responsive. Moga Pivot App is required but is free and very non-intrusive. Having your phone in the little cradle thing is optional but not required.<br />However there are 2 things about it that I don't like.<br /><br />1: It takes 2 triple A batteries (not included). However they seem to last quite a while.<br />2: There is no D pad. For games that need just a D pad or both D pad and analog stick this can be an issue. You can map the other analog stick to be a D pad but it doesn't feel right, especially on retro titles.<br /><br />Those 2 issues are small for the price of this controller. It's really nice.	2015-08-29

BOTTOM LINE: (2015) Beautiful ships, nice cities, good music here and there. Tech issues, credit-grubbing, mediocre. Three and a half stars.  Set-up: SWTOR takes a very long time to download. The SWTOR website identifies your computer every time you login. I assume they do that to annoy people into buying their security keys not just to be creepy.  Subscription: The Old Republic (SWTOR) is free to a certain level now. I actually became a subscriber anyway (about $15 a month) to have the full experience. Your rewards for being a subscriber are: much faster experience gains, in-game dlc gifts that are teased months before you get anything to keep you hooked, and just enough Cartel* coins each month to make you realize how expensive the stuff in the cartel is.  Tech: I played SWTOR for about a month then the game wouldn’t load anymore. There were smaller problems before that, connection loss etc. I don’t know if my internet provider throttled the game to death (as it does every website and video) or it was a SWTOR thing but I was already kind of bored with the game.  Game: The combat is ok. You and your companions share up to 3 abilities. Beyond that you can’t really customize your character's abilities except by buying stuff with credits. The graphics are fine (the ships are particularly impressive). The game just isn't that engaging and it’s too focused on credits.  A short list of what you have to pay to do in SWTOR: Increase the size of your inventory. Go to another planet. Get to a new location on the planet.  Upgrade your gear. Upgrade your companion’s skill to maximum. Use Legacy “rewards.” To access each part of a new stronghold. You even pay to sell things to other players on the Galaxy Trade Network.  Multiplayer: Flashpoints allow you to join a group of players to go kill a bunch of people. Sometimes players fall out but group combat was fairly smooth. Its run, fight, thanks for the fight and everybody goes their separate ways. I understand. They’re busy. Credits don’t make themselves.  I was on a PVE story-server, as opposed to an RP-PVP server. Mass PVP didn’t appeal to me. In between typical social media “discussions,” players occasionally yell about their guilds. I accepted a personal invite. No one in the guild ever chatted. I assume we were all invited at random and were focused on our own goals. An MMO might be good if you already know people you are going to play with. Otherwise you use (and are used by) strangers like companions in a video game anyway.  It was never not-interesting being in the Star Wars universe but the wonder wore off surprisingly quickly. You are surrounded by the environment but not immersed in it. Kind of like a theme park. There was an Old Republic video game that’s supposed to be good. I'll probably try that. Maybe it will run.  *The cartel is a catalog you access when you are logged in but it is not part of the game.	2015-08-29

I decided to try the PS4 version and while I found it enjoyable, it's not among my favorite open world games.  I found the learning curve in the beginning to be a little steep.  I never could quite get down the mechanics of fighting.  Sometimes Wei would just stand there as I was hitting the buttons to get him to move.  I'm not sure if it was because I was mashing the buttons too hard or if it was a glitch.  Luckily, you can buy upgraded outfits that come with weapons.  The game became much easier once I had a sword and a gun.  Still, there were little bugs where my gun would randomly disappear or Wei wouldn't pick up a knife that was dropped by another enemy.<br /><br />I was able to overlook the glitches because this game is fun overall.  I loved driving around the open world of Hong Kong.  It was fun to play a game that wasn't set in the U.S.  The game features lots of side missions that I enjoyed playing.  My favorite side mission was the drug bust one where you have to hack a camera and then catch a criminal remotely.  The characters in this game slowly grew on me.  At first, I found them all rather irritating, but Wei and his best friend grew on me to the point where I cared what happened to them.<br /><br />Overall, this game is worth playing if you're a fan of open world games.  It's a great value and it comes with all of the DLC.  I enjoyed playing it while waiting for the blockbuster games to come out this year.	2015-08-29

There is nothing wrong with the mic, regardless of the negative reviews. I am willing to bet the people that say it is horrible power their miniamp through their usb on ps4. What they dont realize is the usb is also the mic through ps4. Yes with this setup the mic is horrible. However if you have common sense you will buy a mic cable to plug into the controller. This eliminates every mic problem people complain about. I myself have a standalone power supply and optical cable switch hooking this up to my ps4 xbox one and bluray player. Sound is fantastic mixed with Sennheiser G4ME ONE headset.  If you have mic problems, do as i said and it completely solves it.	2015-08-29

I love the concept of this console and was very excited to receive it and try it out.  At first, it worked perfectly.  Within less than a week of its arrival, the jack for the AC adaptor plug had somehow loosened to the point that the power plug no longer stays plugged in.  The slightest touch will dislodge the power cord, and there goes your game!  If that wasn't bad enough, the included controllers do not work on SNES games, at least not on my console.  Even SNES controllers which work perfectly on a SNES do not work when plugged into the SNES ports.  I did not drop or otherwise abuse the console.  I am truly amazed at how fragile and poorly built this thing is.	2015-08-29

Straight to the point:<br />Not everyone is going to like this game.<br />I however, have put 1250 hours into this game, it is so addicting. The reward system is set up to give you completely random rewards and for most content you aren't guaranteed anything. If you get this you will be hunting down a particular weapon for hundreds of hours. If you don't like the sound of that, it's not for you.<br />As of right now the story is completely absent from destiny. This may change with the new expansion: The Taken King. It looks promising and if you're just getting destiny it is a great deal. The original game plus 2 dlc's ($20 a piece) plus the Taken King expansion for $60.<br />Despite its current lack of story, the competitive multiplayer is amazing. In no other first person shooter do you get the visual feedback on your screen like in destiny. It shows how much health an opponent has left and is all around great fun. Weapon balancing is an issue right now for the competitive multiplayer, as only a few top tier &#34;exotic&#34; weapons rule this game mode. However they are releasing a patch soon to rebalance the weapons (something they do every few months) and I hope it'll bring other weapons up to par.<br />All in all, I have loved every second of this game. I don't know how long I will play it, but I'm not stopping anytime soon.<br /><br />Onto The Taken King, guardians	2015-08-29

If you're looking for a deep story, good mechanics and a well-crafted game world, you need to move along to another game.<br /><br />I could never get into the Atelier series.  They seemed custom crafted to appeal to gamers who love chirpy, super cute graphics.  Atelier Shallie promised to be the best of the series so I checked it out and was very disappointed.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />The graphics are pretty good.  The environments can be a little sparse but the character design is bright and colorful with quite a lot of details.  You can tell that Gust was working on attracting the neckbearded anime nerds and female Goth/Loli lovers with the designs.  The menus are bright and the color palette seems to strike the right blend of gloom (the world maps) and cute (the menu screens).<br /><br />Sound:<br />The music is bland and entirely forgettable.  The character voices are stereotypically Japanese (if you play with Japanese dialogue turned on).  Girls' voices are at the upper end of dog hearing and the guys are about 1 notch below.  Enemies don't make much noise, at all.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The main thrust of the game is doing missions and synthesizing items with alchemy.  This is about 80% of the game and if you are into this kind of thing then you will love this game.  The areas (just one or two screens each) can be selected and you can run through them and battle enemies and harvest items.  The items and monsters respawn each time you go through.  The big problem is that battles are either really easy or impossible.  You'll blow through normal enemies and then you'll meet a HUGE monster that you cannot even dent.  Death means nothing and you just go back to the World Map.  The battle mechanics are OK and you can keep a reserve member to help defend or attack.  The problem is that the battle animations are rough: enemies fade away, attack animations are choppy and the battles seem like just a waste of time.  You get seemingly arbitrary amounts of experience points and there's no real way to judge if a battle will be easy other than to just try and see if you can win.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Milquetoast Shallie or Incompetent Shallie has to do a bunch of quests because blahblahblahblah.  The plot is almost nonexistent and creates no urgency or wonder or anything but &#34;now do this quest and then after that do this one.&#34;  It's like running down a checklist. None of the characters have anything but basic, stereotypical personalities.<br /><br />This game has potential but falls short on an enjoyable experience.  It's almost as if a design team said &#34;what if we stopped taking time to write a plot and just made the sidequests into the main quests?&#34;	2015-08-29

I'd been wanting this game for a long time now, but wanted to wait till I got the PS4 so I'd have more games on it.(Since I already has so many on PS3). I had gotten it since I was going to be going out of town to my Aunt's house, who doesn't have great internet(or really any at all).<br /><br />My mom said I could take it with me since we'd be there for a long time. I never ONCE turned on the PS3 or used any other games what so ever. I love this game so much, it's one of the best open world games I've played in a long time. At one point I was just like to hell with the story! My mom, dad, aunt, just everyone in my family that was there started playing. We just had a ton of fun driving around, since none of use were any good at it. The story is okay, could had been better. But it's a ton of fun I honestly which some of the Assassin's Creed games were like this.<br />I hope Ubisoft makes another Watch Dogs, just even for the fact I can just drive around blowing stuff up.<br /><br />While playing this game, it was the most I'd seen my dad laugh in along time.<br /><br />All in all, great game, good game play, rather easy controls.	2015-08-29

It was in very good shape, I would give it 8.5 stars out of 10 for appearance and a 10 out of 10 for functionality. All the buttons worked and were not nasty or grimy.

I also use it now because it is great! The vibration in the controller is much better than the original controller that comes with the Xbox 360 ([[ASIN:B003ZSP0WW Xbox 360 Wireless Controller - Glossy Black]]) , and also is much better in many different ways. I personally like it more because the size is slightly bigger, and the buttons are easier to use because they are more defined on the controller. The only downsides are that the controller is chrome, so it is easy to smudge and looks bad after a while and also it is very expensive. Overall, it is a good controller, but is way too expensive for what it actually does and what it's worth.	2015-08-29

I use this game as a reference guide to identify various forms of life in our oceans with adolescents and younger adults who have not had the opportunity to explore the oceans themselves. Of course, one video game is not a substitute for the real thing such as going out an exploring the world underwater. But it does become an added teaching tool in the study of marine life using visualization, imagery, and hand eye coordination. Another game to enjoy that does not glorify murder and mayhem which has become so common in video games today. One of the reasons I like Nintendo games like Deep Ocean. Hoping to see Deep Blue Ocean and similar games continue on the Wiiu and Nx.<br /><br />“The best video game is the one that teaches.”<br />Zahor Bano Begum 1985	2015-08-29

Over the course of like 4 Batman games, I am leaning toward 1 away from 2. Now does that mean this game isn't good? No, it is awesome and the intro of the Batmobile makes it feel way cooler. But it is so predictable and I am getting way to good at taking down whole screens full of bad guys because the combat system is so predictable.

Voice acting is perfect. Working through the puzzles and clues is very fun. Across 6 different cases, you get to experiment with different mechanics, each case lasting roughly 3 to 5 hours depending on how thorough you are; that's a total of 18 to 30 hours of gameplay which is very good value.<br /><br />The only minor issue I had with this game is that for each case, there are several possible conclusions depending on how you choose to assemble the clues. As others have said, this means every conclusion is usually based on circumstantial evidence, meaning there is not &#34;right&#34; or &#34;wrong&#34;. This may or may not be a big deal to you, and it was just a minor thing for me, but you will not have the satisfaction of solving each mystery &#34;correctly&#34;.<br /><br />Overall, this game is highly entertaining and I truly enjoyed it, and recommend it for the thinking gamer.	2015-08-29

I bought this from ValueDeluxe. It took about three weeks to get here and tracking wasn't available. As for the product... it's not the highest quality (but what do you expect for 10 bucks?). The plastic is cheapish and the only &#34;glossy&#34; part is the top cover. The rest of the body is dry and lifeless. Also, the form of the parts are not exactly like Nintendo parts and so it can be difficult to install. I had to melt a bit here and there so that things would fit but it is not noticeable. As for installation, if you have no experience doing anything like this, don't. Sure, it's possible you could succeed, but why risk breaking a perfectly functional DS lite just to put a cheap plastic body on it? Anywho, I'm giving this two stars because 1. Proportions are all wrong and my DS didn't close properly. 2. My DS looks cheap now instead of the expected awesome. 3. Installation instructions were incomplete (no instructions on how to change the screen frames to yellow).	2015-08-29

When mine arrived the box was partially crushed (Not their fault particularly). When I opened my package I  was a bit disappointed as the D-pad did not feel right. I promptly fixed it by placing a small piece of cotton behind the main board of the d-pad fixing the odd feel. My only other complaint is the 8 ft cord. I mean it is really convenient but it adds about .1 sec of lag to the controller than what I am used to. So trying to do frame perfect tricks on SMW will take a little getting used to.	2015-08-29

Have all that and are ok with a digital download then you'll be fine.

If you play your all of your GameCube games with the thumbstick, please ignore this review. I play all of my GameCube games on the Wii and needed to replace my old controller. I heard positive reviews about the Smash Bros. GameCube Controller and since it was compatible with GameCube games, I purchased one. I tested the controller on all of my games and the controls were very responsive. The thumbstick, buttons, and C-stick were working perfectly, but I quickly discovered something alarming. The D-pad seems to be extremely sensitive to ALL of my GameCube games. When I press up, down, left, or right, it thinks I'm pressing a diagonal input. I play half my GameCube games with the D-pad and I find it frustrating that the controls aren't functioning properly. I know this controller was exclusive to Smash Bros. but it was advertised to be compatible with GameCube games. The D-pad being overly sensitive might be a flaw to these new controllers, so purchase at your own risk.	2015-08-29
US	24910296	R20AY7SZQNHQO	B00EFRN2IQ	793022980	Sims 4	Video Games	4	0	1	N	N	tl;dr - Solid game but wait for a sale because $60 is a lot for a base game	I waited to get the Sims 4 until about a week ago, as I wait for every Sims upgrade, and really any game upgrade the I know will come with expansions, etc. Why? Because when you buy a new version of a game that you have every expansion and mod known to man for and then have to revert back to playing just a base game without even bug fixes, it's always going to suck. Always. So, I've waited til there was a sale (because no Sims base game is worth $60) and picked up the basic version. Since I waited, many of the issues (no pools, no dishwashers, etc) were fixed with game patches. This is the case with pretty much every game anymore, so be aware that many &#34;huge&#34; or &#34;unfixable&#34; issues people were freaking out about have already been fixed.<br /><br />First, yes, it definitely is different than the Sims 3. In a lot of ways, this is great. I don't mind a 5 second load screen between locations when it means I don't have a 5 minute load time initially. The Sims 3 took forever to get up and running, and that always annoyed me. Also, the world is what I'd call &#34;semi-open&#34;. There are little neighborhoods that the Sims seem to be able to pop around in without a load screen, and when your Sim is out of their home lot, you still have partial control over the sim at home (you can make them &#34;take care of self&#34; &#34;build skill...&#34; and other general activities). Relationships also take A LOT longer. My first household was two Sims living together, and they aren't in love after like a day. It does seem a big more organic and not like it takes TOO long based on the Sim's lifespan. However, if you want to have a Don Juan/Juanita type Sim, it'll definitely be harder.<br /><br />One of the things I do miss, kind of, from the Sims 3 is Create-a-Style. I thought I'd miss it way more than I do, though. For sure, I miss being able to make custom hair colors and modify make up colors. Even with mods, not all the mods have the exact same color of hair and soyou kind of end up stuck using one creator's hair styles. Generally, it's not a problem if you want to use someone like Skysims or Nightcrawler because they already have lots of styles out, but if it's a newer mod creator it can be annoying since they don't have like 100 hairstyles I can choose from. I also miss being able to change the bed linen colors, and the walls. However, there are a lot of built in options so generally, I was able to find something I liked fine in the base game as far as furnishings. Of course, we'll get more and better furnishings each time we pony up for an expansion pack, or if you go and look at thesimsresource.com or modthesims.com. MOST experienced Sim players already mod their games to hell and back, so I think losing Create-a-Style hasn't been as bad as it could be, but I do wish it was available for the less tech savvy among us who can only download and install custom content, as opposed to creating it (If you aren't downloading custom content from the above sites, I encourage you to start. They have content for ALL Sims games and instructions on how to add it to your game. It's very easy and really fun!).<br /><br />A handful of items are &#34;unlockable&#34; by achieving certain things (like reaching the top of a career or something). Since I mod my games into oblivion, the idea of unlocking an item is kind of a fun side-quest type thing, as opposed to super annoying given the small amount of items overall.<br /><br />Build mode is different, but I think it's MUCH better. First, there are premade rooms, which is a nice shortcut when building. Second, roofs are far more complex now. There's no auto-roof, but it's not as difficult to make cool looking roofs anymore, either. It's hard to explain how build mode is different, exactly, but it seemed easier to use. Buy mode has to be accessed through build mode, and has the same options of searching by room or by item type. Buy mode confused me for a second but I don't mind it now.<br /><br />You also only get three traits per sim! That part is kind of dumb. Maybe an university pack will allow a fourth, or something, but it still seemed kind of light on the personality and I wish I could have added two more traits. :( Additionally, I think some of the skills are less intuitive. For example, you have to find an actual fishing spot to fish, as opposed to just clicking on the water or looking for a school of fish. I had to ask Google for help on that one. lol But there are more skills, so there's that.<br /><br />As far as similarities, in the base game, you control your Sim at work the same way, with a handful of options. You can text<br /><br />One of the new additions I didn't think I'd care about but kind of like now is the emotions. It's more complex than &#34;Sim has to pee&#34; &#34;Sim is hungry&#34; or what have you. The emotions stack, and modify each other, and while they sometimes relate to the needs (such as being uncomfortable or bored), other times they're outside the needs or sparked from other activities. Sims in certain moods can do extra things, not just with other Sims but with the world around them. This includes special paintings (there are WAY more options for painting now, in general), and getting embarrassed from sucking at playing an instrument (as well as making other sims &#34;tense&#34; because they suck). It helps make up for the lack of traits (still mad about that though, I'll be honest) and I think it could be fun as you get further on.<br /><br />Overall, I think Sims 4 is a solid game. I haven't been tempted to go back to Sims 3, which I kept installed just in case, and I don't find myself fast-forwarding through everything or cheating to keep my Sims from freaking out and having low needs. I only have the base game at the moment, but I've probably added 100 items via mods. The expansions are cheaper this time around, it seems, but I'm entertained enough to wait. I know a lot of people are pissed about Sims 4, but Istill think it's worth playing and trying. A lot of people were pissed about Sims 3 as well. People just hate change, especially gamers. That being said, I think I would still encourage you to wait for a price drop or an Origin sale, since it's a lot less frustrating to buy a $35 game and think, this is okay but I wish it had more, and paying $60-70 for a game and thinking the same thing.	2015-08-29

It works great. Just stick the remote in and it charges as expected. There are no cables or issues guiding in so it will sit just right. I thought the plastic may be too light duty, but so far OK. It has some spring/give to it. The controller stack, so shelf space real estate needed is kept limited which is nice.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can possibly say about it after a year is that the LED charge lights may be too bright for some places. I'm not sure I would want it in my bedroom, or right next to my TV as it could be distracting. Take this into consideration before you get/use it. They make a nice night light in my living room, so I actually find the LED's to be a benefit.<br /><br />The only improvement I can think of would be a 'gas gauge' on how far along the charge is, 25%, 50%, etc.	2015-08-29

At first I was not sure I was going to get this, since I have already played the game on Xbox 360 in 2007. If you are wondering if enough is different to justify the purchase, well yes there is. The game still has that gritty dark look that so many people liked about the series. I know a lot of the early videos made the game look a lot brighter than the original. This actually is not how GOW Ultimate is. I repeat it is very dark and gritty.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the computer intelligence of your comrades is just as stupid if not more stupid then the original game. You basically just play the game by yourself. The computer controlled partners will run right out and get shot and are useless. Also I really would have liked if they would have thrown in a version of Horde in the game. I know Horde did not debut until the second game, but it has a huge following.

Probably the most fun I've had in a &#34;David Cage&#34; like game (e.g., Indigo Prophecy, Beyond Two Souls and Heavy Rain) and it wasn't even made by David Cage.  A very cool game where choices do matter.  Game elements, dialog, even character deaths can change by a simple choice or the finding of a clue.  There are jump scares aplenty, however, the real horror comes from a general sense of dread and anxiety that makes you on edge the entire time you're playing.  While I did rent it from Gamefly, I do recommend purchasing it (which I will).  Sony and game developers need to know video game enthusiasts want quality games like Until Dawn.  Play it.

Before purchasing it, I was a bit hesitant because of the lukewarm reviews. However, I bit the bullet, and have had no regrets. The game mechanics are very similar to Arkham City, with some minor gadget variations. Overall, the game plays great, though it does have some minor hiccups, such as a slight pause during the cutscenes, or small glitches involving the hostiles when you interrogate them. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, I would recommend you do. As of right now, I feel it has the best boss battles among the 4 Arkham games, in addition to the best story line.	2015-08-29

You open the box and inside is a very nice controller case. Open that and you have a controller slot with some nice foam to keep your controller safe on the lid portion are two mesh pockets with a Velcro portion to keep everything tidy very nice case. The braided cable is of good length, and plugs in nice and easy. The controller is plug and play into pc which is what I am using it for. So first issue the backlit button are cheap crap. The buttons don't cover the whole slot so the light just shines straight out. Yes, it has a function to turn them off, but in messing with this option I came across problem 2. Access option to turn backlight off then go turn off rumble since I don't like rumble pressing the button to switch turns the backlight back on. So after messing around with it a bit, gave up on having both backlight and rumble turned off. Moved on trying to play the game I wanted it for Tera. This is a game I play with a controller that has to compete with people who use keyboards and mouse. So I was trying to keep playing with a controller, so for instance if I have block mapped to right mouse button and click the character will block as fast as I can click. The problem with controller is that they have that depress time was hoping this razer wouldn't. It has less depress than my xbox one controller, but the button are not very quick to respond so despite spamming B to block I block once every 2 seconds. This Is not very conducive at all considering especially in PvP I have to unblock rotate my character and re-block to block an attack coming from a different direction rapidly. So that's pretty much a right off for me but I'll continue. The thumb-sticks are very slow as well I play with max sensitivity on this game and it felt like I had cut my sensitivity in half. So again in PvP well changing camera angles and character direction needs to be rapid, I don't need a controller that lets people run circles around me faster than I can turn. Now for this &#34;ergonomic&#34; design the part of the controller on the outside part of the bumpers pushes outward physically making it harder to push the bumpers. I normally can use the bumper and trigger with just one finger on xbox one/360 and PS4 controller but this one was making me fight it to do that do to its bad design, also made that extra set of bumper they put into the controller very difficult to get at. This controller feels cheap overall like some knockoff. So poor buttons, bad programming  in the panel, terrible thumb-sticks and horribly ergonomic design controller, that came in a very nice case with a nice cable. I will stick with my xbox one controller.	2015-08-29

When I was sent this product for an honest review I didn't feel the product was necessary since the Xbox One has a large cooling fan. I was wrong, I have seen a huge improvement to my Xbox One and its performance. Not only does this product turn 2 USB ports into 4 it helps keep the Xbox One cool for extended gaming and helps prevent things like frame drop and other negative effects of overheating. It has a small noise to it but if you play with the volume at a decent number or you play with a headset it will not effect your gaming experience. Overall I believe this is a great product and I would say this item should be on the radar for any serious or casual gamer.<br /><br />Again, I was provided this product in an exchange for an honest review. This did not impact my review in any way.	2015-08-29

The loading screens are long and frequent, but if you are a fan of any of the other games, then this one should be no different.  Granted the main character is annoying, but the story is overall appreciable.  The new features like hunting and ship combat are great.	2015-08-29
