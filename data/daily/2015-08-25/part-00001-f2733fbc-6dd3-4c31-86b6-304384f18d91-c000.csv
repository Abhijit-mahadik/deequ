You have to do a lot of running (and I mean a LOT): as this is not possible on the Balance Board, you turn to an awkward hubble, shifting weight from one foot to the other. And then the motion is not easily picked up by the Wii, so walk or even stand still, rather than run. Every 3 minutes you come across a new exercise, but these have the same problems: they are not meant to be done on a Balance Board and the motion is not picked up. And then it is back to running again.<br /><br />All in all, it is irritating and not rewarding at all. Thumbs down!!	2015-08-25

I am a huge gamer and I've been using the xbox 360 core ever since it came out back in 06. Microsoft has always done amazing with their consoles and I am looking foward to seeing what is next! Here is the 1 downside of it: I have the 500gb console and I can tell that it WILL run out of internal storage. You can't remove the hard drive like in the 360s, so that is one of the only dissapointments I had with the console. Most games take up about 20-50 gb and if you just get the downloaded games, you WILL run out of space..... But hey, if you want all the space, just get the 1tb console and it will last a lot longer. I am pleased and happy with this console and I expect to get the most out of it while I'm into gaming! P.S.: I reccomend getting a recharging station for the controller because AA batteried do not last long. I hope this review is helpful to those looking top buy one!	2015-08-25

Basically, this game relies HEAVILY on story.  (obviously)  There really isn't much &#34;gameplay&#34; in the sense of the traditional style, that is.  Regardless, if you have ever played, and enjoyed, &#34;Heavy Rain&#34; you'll know that story is the ultimate factor in a game.  That being said, this game is just that.  It's one giant, interactive, Horror movie.  This is the game that &#34;Night Trap&#34; was to become.  You follow eight friends back to the location of a terrible accident that happened a year prior.  You must survivor &#34;until dawn&#34;.  Clever?  I think so.<br /><br />Anyways, nearly every decision you make has some sort of impact on your playing experience.  This leads to countless replays, in my opinion.  I'm such a horror fan that I want to know EVERYTHING that is possible.  Of course, I was the same way playing Heavy Rain, so.  I absolutely love these types of games, as they put you into the atmosphere perfectly and you really feel as if you're one of the characters.  The characters, are portrayed perfectly by their respective real life counterpart.<br /><br />I can't give this game enough praise.  I just wish I could start all over again without ANY knowledge of what's going to happen.<br /><br />Final Verdict:  I you're into this type of game, you can't go wrong.  If you are a sucker for &#34;action&#34;, this might not be for you.	2015-08-25

Have you really played it or just have an agenda against Madden? In either case... Madden took years to come to form. I admit there has been some rough releases over the years.  I've played it since it's first arrival on the beloved Sega Genesis and look what we got now?  It's had a rocky road here and there, and  I understand it's been under heat for being too much like the previous years game, but no worries, they give you just enough to make it feel new.<br /><br />Madden 16 is the first game to utilize penalties to their potential. We finally have them and they work! Pass interference calls? Yep sure are. Holding? Yep. Defensive holding? Sure thing. Late hits penalty calls? You bet!  This makes the game feel more like a real game.  I haven't decided if they're over done yet, but so far, it's pretty standard on what you see in a real game.  It really adds to the realism if you're into the more simulation aspects. It still has the classic controls of Madden.  Truck stick, hit stick, spin move, hurdle, juke, etc.... Long time madden fans will be right at home with it. The newest things are the aggressive catch and possession catch functions. The aggressive catch can make for a amazing eye candy that you have never seen in a football game before, it's so real people walking into the room are thinking they're seeing ESPN highlights. With aggressive catch activated with &#34;triangle&#34; on the PS4, you can make for some spectacular catches and they look spectacular on both sides of the ball. Defensive will also make some amazing attempts to gain possession. Defense can do the same thing, so it's kind of a crapshoot what happens depending if they go up for the aggressive catch. You can make some mistakes if you get hit using the aggressive too much and interceptions can be more gracious. I do like the new function, but as with anything, including the penalties, if you don't like them, turn them off.<br /><br />The game feel more organic than ever. 15 was great IMO already. Sure, you get the occasional times where guys flop around on piles and play possum on the field till they want to get up. Yeah, I understand it looks silly, but does it really interfere with the game itself?  A lot of review sites already say this is unacceptable. I say, it's no big deal. When the game is in play, that's what counts.<br /><br />The game has a fantastic running game. Blockers seem to make holes and are smarter around running down the field with you. The classic truck stick is still there, although I dont think it's as powerful as it once was as a veteran Madden player will probably agree. 16 has a ton of new animations to make the game feel more awesome. There's some brutal hits going on in this game. Although I've probably put in 10 hours already, I haven't had any injuries? hmmmm.<br /><br />Passing feels good. I actually prefer to play on the game speed on &#34;very slow&#34;. I think normal or even slow is too much speed for me, but that's just a preference.  QB's with lower ratings finally are making more incomplete passes and they are definitely inconsistent! That's good! I noticed in 15, QB's with bad ratings were sometimes going 25 for 27 in one game! Now if your QB is just a bench guy or not very good in general, you'll see a lot of short and overthrown passes. This is a good thing again if you're playing a team with strong running game, but a passing game, not so much. QB's seem to get more rattled. As mentioned above, you're going to see some great one on one battles with the new &#34;aggressive&#34; catch option.  IF you want to play things safe, you can go for the regular catch or possession. Going for strictly possession, you lose the ability to get yards after a catch. Some people like to just let the cpu do all the work, that's fine, but you lose your ability to make big plays. That's the rules with madden for years, if you take over, youhave a better chance at making something big happen!<br /><br />Defensively is still fun with the &#34;behind the back perspective&#34; Sometimes I feel like the camera does some funky things after a pass, but I can usually play good defense sticking with this angle. The hit stick, while still there, doesn't seem as intense as past years? (Is this the NFL saying tone is down EA?) I sure hope not. Either way, it's good we still have the ability to make a big hit to cause those fumbles!<br /><br />Presentation is better than last year, but it's not light years better. Some new commentary lines here and there, a bit more details, but they still sound like they're reading too much. Not horribly bad, but needs a rehaul for next year.<br /><br />The graphics are stunning. The players faces got the most love, you'll see that in the intro. Very detailed stadiums, amazing use of lighting and shadows and spot on reflections on the helmets.  Some of the cut scenes they show in between plays etc are a bit over done, but hey, if you like presenation, there ya go!<br /><br />The classic and most beloved mode is back, the Ultimate Team mode. Build your team of scrubs into the ultimate Madden team and take them online!<br /><br />Speaking of online, I haven't had any major issues, EA has always had decent servers. I've only noticed a few games with a little input lag, but it's very good considering how many people were playing at once.<br /><br />Madden 16 is a great game. Anyone new to the series should pick it up. I don't know if I can justify 60 bucks if you have 15, but if you're a Madden fan like I am, I already know that you probably already have it. God bless.ng big happen!

This was the one game that my friend would give a ten out of ten and it's one of five for me. Alongside Tales of Vesperia, Majora's Mask, Virtues Last Reward and Devil May Cry 3, this is one of the best games of all time. The story is immersive, the characters fun and the gameplay is the best turn-based combat there is, with the use of 1more attacks by exploiting weaknesses and random aid, like cavalry attacks and team ups. The social link system is unique, adding a purpose to interacting with the diverse and interesting side characters. If I had one criticism, it's that there is no point to aim for any ending but the Golden ending, but that's because the Golden ending is so good and most of the other endings are basically game overs with a conclusion to the story. If you like JRPGs, you already own this game. If you're wondering if this is worth buying a Vita or PSTV for, I'd say there is no better RPG on the system and definitely should lean you towards buying it.	2015-08-25

I really wish Amazon would let us do half stars in reviews because 5 out of 5 is too high but 4 out of 5 is too low, but to me the game is closer to 80 than 100, so I wanted to keep the rating realistic.<br /><br />Each year of the PS4 / XB1 era, Madden has continuously improved in many areas, but still lacks in the additions on the CFM side; which keeps it from reaching a perfect score.  The area they have best excelled in is gameplay, and it has come a LONG way since it's current gen debut.<br /><br />The great part of the gameplay comes with a new wrinkle of the WR/DB interactions.  It feels like there is a true jostling between the two players with true results.  Not only do you get true results, but the animations and look and feel are fresh with every pass attempt.  Speaking of the pass attempts, you can do a lot with QB to get it to the WR in the best possible way from holding down the button for a bullet pass, double tapping the button for a touch pass, or tapping the button once for a lob.  You can modify using L1 or LB for a high pass and L2 or LT for a low pass, and once you get the hang of these mechanics, you can start doing them without thinking about it when the situation arises.<br /><br />While it is disappointing that CFM is pretty much unchanged, and still isn't as engaging online as the Online Dynasty was in NCAA Football.  There are still some great additions, including a long time commish wishlist item, choosing the winner for simulated games.  I also really like the dynamic drive goals.  Much like the dynamic goals in NBA 2K's MyPlayer mode, it gives a level of immersion and changes it up for you instead of just sticking to your same ol' gameplan.  It makes you change things up, but really doesn't penalize you if you choose not to accept the mission.  I also like the running tally of game, season, and career goals for the players showing at the bottom after a play as well.  Those are some welcome tweaks.<br /><br />The biggest new mode of Madden 16 is Draft Champions, and it is fun as hell.  First you choose your coach that will give you style boost for one offensive and one defensive group, then you draft 15 players to mold your team.  You'll be shown three players and you have to choose one.  The great thing about this is when you highlight the player, it also highlights your current depth chart below so you don't draft two studs at the same position.  That is very slick.  I could have done without Adam Schefter's commentary after picks though.  The players that come up will be a balance between gold and elite Ultimate Team players with the 15th and final round drafting a legend.  You'll then try to win three games to be the Draft Champion either solo or online with friends.  I think it's a great way to play Madden for some competition with friends on a random night.<br /><br />Speaking of Ultimate Team, it is back with a very sharp new logo and a bunch of new content as well.  There are well over 150 solo challenges to do in the new Journey; which are full of scenarios and not just full games to beat.  Not only is it something new to try to beat with your Ultimate Team, but it is a great way to get your team started as well because each challenge gives you coins and sometimes packs to help build your team without having to break the bank early on buying packs.<br /><br />And finally, I'm not going to give any spoilers, but the opening playable scene is AMAZING and props to those who had a hand in creating it.<br /><br />Overall, Madden 16 is VERY close to achieving their ultimate goals, and if they work on Connected Franchise next year with what the community wants to see, they will reach those goals.	2015-08-25

They have been both a hit and absolutely a miss. Most racing games for the Nintendo 3DS have been both a hit and a miss. The most successful is been Mario Kart 7, which has delivered stunning graphics, and excellent gameplay. The least favorite racing game has been a Hot Wheels game, that has been more about effects, and not gameplay. But seeing a popular app become a Nintendo 3DS game, is really a big challenge. Garfield Kart has been a very successful app to download to the tablets and the smartphone. But being available to the Nintendo 3DS, well making that deliver just as strong is really a challenge. Garfield has been so popular as a cartoon and a comic strip for over 30 years. But the question is does it really deliver for the 3DS.<br /><br />Garfield Kart for the Nintendo 3DS, is one of those that looks like fun, but overall needs a lot of work that really can deliver as a more serious game. Loosely based on the characters from the Garfield Show from 2007-2009 on Cartoon Network and Boomerang, you can play your favorites from Garfield, Odie, John Arbuckle and others through 16 different tracks and 3 speed levels. Graphically, the game looks good and has the classic music from The Garfield Show very nicely. Sadly, what makes the game loose its shine is mainly the control. The controls are too loose, and you honestly are going to spend a little more time spinning out, and not making it to the checkered flag in first place. Sadly, it does cause the game to loose the fun overall. The game does have a lot of spin, but honestly a little too much to where it might not be fun.<br /><br />All in all, Garfield Kart does mostly have what I would want in a racing game, except that there could have been much tighter control, to make it more fun to play. I still enjoy Garfield, but I could not believe that there could have been much better overall. It is a lovely racing game, but sadly, the most important part of a video game, is really addictive fun. I was interested in it, and sadly I really lost a bit of fun afterwards. I do hope that if there is going to be a better follow-up to try and definitely step it up on the lasanga loving fun. The game is a good title for huge Garfield fans, but not for the long-term video game racer.<br /><br />Graphics: B<br /><br />Sound: B<br /><br />Control: C-<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: C<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+a video game, is really addictive fun.

Had 10 hours to paly this bad boy before the release today so I thought I'd give my two cents. First of all, I usually go with ps4 games, but I couldn't resist having the ability to play it for 10 horus before release with EA access. EA access basically lets' you play games early, which is a good thing. And I have to say I'm very pleased with the XBONE Version of Madden.<br /><br />Madden took years to come to form. I've played it since it's first arrival on the beloved Sega Genesis and look what we got now?  It's had a rocky road here and there, and  I understand it's been under heat for being too much like the previous years game, but no worries, they give you just enough to make it feel new.<br /><br />Madden 16 is the first game to utilize penalties to their potential. We finally have them and they work! Pass interference calls? Yep sure are. Holding? Yep. Defensive holding? Sure thing. Late hits penalty calls? You bet!  This makes the game feel more like a real game.  I haven't decided if they're over done yet, but so far, it's pretty standard on what you see in a real game.  It really adds to the realism if you're into the more simulation aspects. It still has the classic controls of Madden.  Truck stick, hit stick, spin move, hurdle, juke, etc.... Long time madden fans will be right at home with it. The newest things are the aggressive catch and possession catch functions. The aggressive catch can make for a amazing eye candy that you have never seen in a football game before, it's so real people walking into the room are thinking they're seeing ESPN highlights. With aggressive catch activated with *Y* on the XBONE you can make for some spectacular catches and they look spectacular on both sides of the ball. Defensive will also make some amazing attempts to gain possession. Defense can do the same thing, so it's kind of a crapshoot what happens depending if they go up for the aggressive catch. You can make some mistakesif you get hit using the aggressive too much and interceptions can be more gracious. I do like the new function, but as with anything, including the penalties, if you don't like them, turn them off.<br /><br />The game feel more organic than ever. 15 was great IMO already. Sure, you get the occasional times where guys flop around on piles and play possum on the field till they want to get up. Yeah, I understand it looks silly, but does it really interfere with the game itself?  A lot of review sites already say this is unacceptable. I say, it's no big deal. When the game is in play, that's what counts.<br /><br />The game has a fantastic running game. Blockers seem to make holes and are smarter around running down the field with you. The classic truck stick is still there, although I dont think it's as powerful as it once was as a veteran Madden player will probably agree. 16 has a ton of new animations to make the game feel more awesome. There's some brutal hits going on in this game. Although I've probably put in 10 hours already, I haven't had any injuries? hmmmm.<br /><br />Passing feels good. I actually prefer to play on the game speed on &#34;very slow&#34;. I think normal or even slow is too much speed for me, but that's just a preference.  QB's with lower ratings finally are making more incomplete passes and they are definitely inconsistent! That's good! I noticed in 15, QB's with bad ratings were sometimes going 25 for 27 in one game! Now if your QB is just a bench guy or not very good in general, you'll see a lot of short and overthrown passes. This is a good thing again if you're playing a team with strong running game, but a passing game, not so much. QB's seem to get more rattled. As mentioned above, you're going to see some great one on one battles with the new &#34;aggressive&#34; catch option.  IF you want to play things safe, you can go for the regular catch or possession. Going for strictly possession, you lose the ability to get yards after a catch. Some people like to just let the cpudo all the work, that's fine, but you lose your ability to make big plays. That's the rules with madden for years, if you take over, you have a better chance at making something big happen!<br /><br />Defensively is still fun with the &#34;behind the back perspective&#34; Sometimes I feel like the camera does some funky things after a pass, but I can usually play good defense sticking with this angle. The hit stick, while still there, doesn't seem as intense as past years? (Is this the NFL saying tone is down EA?) I sure hope not. Either way, it's good we still have the ability to make a big hit to cause those fumbles!<br /><br />Presentation is better than last year, but it's not light years better. Some new commentary lines here and there, a bit more details, but they still sound like they're reading too much. Not horribly bad, but needs a rehaul for next year.<br /><br />The graphics are stunning. The players faces got the most love, you'll see that in the intro. Very detailed stadiums, amazing use of lighting and shadows and spot on reflections on the helmets.  Some of the cut scenes they show in between plays etc are a bit over done, but hey, if you like presenation, there ya go!<br /><br />The classic and most beloved mode is back, the Ultimate Team mode. Build your team of scrubs into the ultimate Madden team and take them online!<br /><br />Speaking of online, I haven't had any major issues, EA has always had decent servers. I've only noticed a few games with a little input lag, but it's very good considering how many people were playing at once.<br /><br />Madden 16 is a great game. Anyone new to the series should pick it up. I don't know if I can justify 60 bucks if you have 15, but if you're a Madden fan like I am, I already know that you probably already have it.

LBX is a very good game that i believe was not marketed or presented correctly for the its release in the US. I believe this game originally launched 3 years ago overseas. You can see this a little when playing this game, but it has the anime feel and is very polished so you won't notice it too much. I actually didn't hear about this game until about a week before release. It seemed cool so i bought it. Being a 26 yr old guy, i was kinda worried because the stuff i was reading was intending it for kids, but anyways here is my review:<br /><br />I've got 4 hours in so far and am on the beginning of episode 3 (no clue how many they are). So far I am really enjoying my experience, from first getting my LBX to stopping an assassination on a public figure using an LBX. The battles last about 1 minute each average with boss battles taking about double for the cut scenes in the middle of a battle. Customization is so huge i am still trying to learn what all i can do to my LBX. Any change you do to your LBX, Does make a difference in a fight.<br /><br />Customization: You can change armor, CPU, Battery, Weapon, etc. there is different armors of course, some will offer big defense but slow you down (Dozer Armor) but some will offer light armor and faster movement (Amazon Armor). Weapons are also each unique, i prefer lances, but always keep a gun handy for longer range.<br /><br />Battles: In the battles at first your 1vs1 but through the story you will be teamed up for 3vs3 battles. The other 2 people on your team will vary but so far its your character's (Van) friends. They are different landscapes that you play on, however most of the time the area will be familiar. The areas are not always flat either, some have multi levels. The Friendly AI will sometimes die easily but most of the time they weaken them for me to finish off which is perfectly fine for me!<br /><br />Overall I like this game, but one thing that worries me is the replay value after the story. there is noonline multiplayer, only local. However if i look at Pokemon, it also just has a story. So i guess i will see when that point comes. If you like Pokemon, Anime, Robots, then you will probably enjoy this game.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and hope i helped someone!	2015-08-25

US	8489911	R1MNDXAP2J5ELS	B0050SXAIG	443852357	Silent Hill HD Collection	Video Games	2	2	2	N	N	The greatest and most disturbing horror game of all time suffers a tragic medicore transfer.	If you ask me, Silent Hill 2 is the greatest game ever made. Hell, it is one of the greatest pieces of literary works ever made. I wasn't a fan of the Silent Hill series. I just thought they were typical horror games, and due to the fact I only really heard about Shattered Memories, who could blame me? Then I heard Fermata in Mystic Air. It was disturbing, it was haunting. It was unlike anything I ever heard. But I did not get the game, nor did I pay attention to it. Fast forward many years. A week ago, I because obsessed with the second game. So I decided to buy a few more tracks. I was drawn into it simply for it's utterly astonishing soundtrack by the superb Akira Yamaoka. It stunned me with it's haunting beauty, melancholic sadness, and unnerving sounds, to where I asked myself, &#34;How can a video game have a soundtrack of this quality?&#34; and read up a lot of it. I fell in love with the very heavy and unsettling subject matter and deep psychological manipulation. The perfect usage of sound, sight, story, and imagery in a video game. This was a truly disturbing and twisted work of art that I needed to experience.  Now, I heard about the HD Collection, and was excited. Affording a PS2, plus the original game was out of the question, unless I bought them used on Amazon. However, the staggering amount of negative reviews keep turning me off, and I was totally torn. I didn't know how to feel because I truly did want this game. I needed to experience it.  I broke down. I bought the Silent Hill HD Collection. I couldn't help it. I started Silent Hill 2, and it was disturbing me right away. It manipulated your mind. The weird indescribable noise while you're running. It was so hard to see. The opening was so sad, and so beautiful. It draws you into this beautifully tragic experience right from the beginning. However, I began to see why exactly this was hated, by my own accounts and comparisons to the original.  I played for what amounted to 10 minutes. I caught onespelling error so far, and cutscenes were strange. When you meet Angela at the graveyard, it's fullscreen and has a blurred effect, as well as brightness, and once it ended, the game went back to it's... I guess &#34;widescreen,&#34; and washed out look and it felt a bit jarring. I'm not sure if this was in the PS2 version. The fog was incredibly blinding, and yes, more dense, however, you could still faintly see a sort of &#34;line,&#34; but it's not too noticeable, at first, anyway. It is more accentuated on the road to Silent Hill. It bothered me, and I noticed some fog surrounding James sort of &#34;stutters,&#34; or &#34;clips.&#34; Exiting a menu is a bit delayed, with the black screen not catching up with it, so yeah, the game continues for a bit before you can see whatever the hell is going on, which made me disoriented and took damage from a nearby enemy before the screen could fade. Due to repeated listening to the music, unfortunately, yes, Akira Yamaoka's beautiful score had been tampered with. To be fair, the new patch did fix the game a bit, which is why I'm giving this two stars. I never checked out Silent Hill 3, or progressed enough to really see more flaws.  I just returned this today, and I will buy a PS2 along with the original version. It's not too expensive, actually. Still, I needed to see the collection for myself. It's not horrible, yet, but yes, pretty frustrating and technically flawed, not to mention jarring, even for someone who hasn't played the original. I agree that this was unacceptable. In fact, it's agonizingly unacceptable. I have NEVER played the original and already I feel the pain of the most horrific game ever made being butchered in a thoughtless transfer.  But, there might be hope. The planned Silent Hills was cancelled, which was tragic as well... but I also heard one of the original developers or artists of I think Team Silent would be working on it. I might be stretching it, and it might be a delusional thought, but whatif the cancellation was a good thing? Could they be possibly, possibly working on porting it again? I mean porting the original second to PSN, or even another attempt at a remaster and actually working from the finished source code? We can hope, we can always hope.	2015-08-25

I have a giant head (typically xxl helmet) which makes these headphones a bit uncomfortable for long-term usage. Also the removable Mic is a pain and not as good as the fixed flexible style of the turtle beaches i used with my 360. Other than that I have no complaints as far as to their function. Audio quality was good and I like that they run off the controller power. It does run down the controller battery faster but that's why I have rechargeable battery packs and a charging station.

Pros:<br />-Fitment is good. Its ok if you mis-aligned the skin, you can peel it off and re-align.<br />-Good price for the quality of the product.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Color is a bit orangey not red like the real MGSV PS4. In a good light you can see the orange hue. But if the PS4 will be in a darker space like indoors or inside a cabinet the color is hue is reddish like the true MGSV PS4.<br />-The prints on the skin isn't sharp. It looks like they were printed on using an old ink jet printer. Far away they look good however.They were readable except for the Diamond Dogs logo where you cant read out the &#34;Diamond&#34; part. (Please excuse my poor photos on the prints. They were just out of focus)<br />-Shipping was a little slow. Prime took me 4 days to ship. This is on the shipper not the product.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you don't want to import the real MGSV PS4, I'd say this skin would suffice your needs. I would recommend wiping your PS4 with alcohol to clean off dust and oils first. Also using a small squeegee will help.	2015-08-25

I am a lifelong, diehard PC gamer and most of the time, consoles are foreign to me.

It is a substantial initial investment, but once you get over that it is pretty fun, especially if you get a Kinect and play with the family.  Now that Windows 10 is out the integration between the two works really well.  I use my PC as a DLNA server to play all my music and video files right to the x-box, and I stream games and apps right to my PC using Windows 10's built-in x-box app.<br /><br />I love living in the future.	2015-08-25

The skin itself looks very good and was not too difficult to put on except for the top inner screen which felt more delicate than the other parts due to how long and skinny it was.<br /><br />I heard from other reviews that the skin fades after awhile, probably from the sweat of the palms.

This game is what you expect. If you played either of the first two or the original for the PS3, it's the same game with major to slightly different stories. I say that as a complement. The series is great for JRPGs and well justified my purchase of the Vita once I was done with the Persona games.<br /><br />This game has one, okay two, big problems though. The minor one I barely want to mention if the lack of an EXE gauge, which is annoying since now SP is used for all skills. The major one, though, is Iris Heart. She is a straight up sadist and molests multiple characters throughout the game. I'm not going to sugar coat it. It's uncomfortable and the game suffers for it. It's a shame too, considering her normal for, Plutia, is such a good complement to the rest of the cast and makes sense as the person to become Planeptune's CPU in an alternate dimension.<br /><br />This game is everything I wanted to be and a little more than I wanted when it came to Iris Heart, but it is on par, if not better than Re;Birth 2. The first is still the best, but none of the games are flat-out bad. The spin offs however, have many problems, so make sure you read reviews on those separately. Those are different games and would not get more than a 3 star from me for any of them.	2015-08-25

I suggest contacting Amazon.<br />The game looks better than ever. It does feel the same as Gears of war 1 control wise. Which is good or bad depending on how much you like or dislike the controls compared to the later titles from Gears of war 1. This means you could shot someone with a boomshot or throw a grenade at their feet and they make it out alive. gears of war 1 was a great game but had audio issues and sometimes choppy moments but here its full 60 fps awesome glory. Its the same game with a other multiplayer modes you'd seen from Gears of war 3 for an example. If you like Gears of war(series) and tired of playing it on on the xbox 360 then try it here. It looks so much better.<br /><br />this is also my what I was told for contacting Amazon regarding my Pre-order<br /><br />Adam, I'm forwarding your concern to our games specialized team.

Here is why...<br /><br />Durability<br /><br />The two black columns with the green wires inside are made of metal. The rest of the headset is hard plastic. The structure of these things are insanely well put together. Worth 300$ if you go off of that. The ear cups have some sort of memory foam which is really breathable for your ears.<br /><br />Comfort<br /><br />The A50's are highly comfortable and easily adjusted by pushing up on the black column and down to move them down of course. Again, he ear cups have some sort of memory foam which is really breathable for your ears and is really comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Set-up<br /><br />Now setting these things up is super easy! 3 Cables: Digital in and out cable, power cable, and charging cable. That's it! Super easy and fast set up! Now these are NOT COMPLETELY WIRELESS if you wanna use xbox live chat. You still need to put the chat able in the controller along in the headset themselves.<br /><br />Connectivity<br /><br />Okay, this is the reason why i returned mine! The first hour or so the headsets were working fine. No buzzing or anything. Perfectly fine! Then out of nowhere my controller starts losing power which in turn causes the controller to constantly disconnect. There was no solution or anything so I returned my headset and went with the Turtle Beach 800X, but thats for another review that I will be writing soon!<br /><br />All in all these headsets are perfect, if you do not want to chat, and just do hardcore gaming!	2015-08-25

It's a great game, really it is. But for this latest iteration there seems to be something new.

Either, their servers are too busy to play right now, or their authentications servers are too confused to be sure just who you are, or maybe they just don't feel like playing but whatever the reason, you don't get to play. Too bad. It's a really good game. I'd like to play it some time.	2015-08-25

In WoW, it was about leveling as fast as possible.  In ESO, it is fun to listen to the quests and invest in the characters (gain a bond with them).  There are so many aspects you can focus on: quests, learning skills/crafting, just running/riding around seeing the beautifully crafted world!	2015-08-25

It's always important to look at reviews FROM THE *UNBIASED* FANS OF THE FRANCHISE who actually know how to review. Raging Blast 2 is definitely a step up from the first game, many problems were fixed that were present in the first game aswell (though no story mode, but lets be real, do you really want to play through the story the 100th time?) If you are a fan of DBZ, i recommend this game to you. You won't regret it!	2015-08-25

I gather that prior to the advent of XBox One, it was only available &#34;out of region.&#34;  At any rate, the things that appealed to me about Sniper Elite were the opportunities to deliberate, plan, and execute.  Lots of stealth, taking on challenges sensibly, in a reasoned order, more or less at my own pace, and being rewarded for such deliberation and care.  If that's what you liked about this company's products, throw your expectations out the window.  Zombie Army is basically a twitch fest, where the &#34;game&#34; rapidly becomes surviving hordes of enemies thrown at you incessantly.  There is zero opportunity for deliberation or strategy.  You might as well go play Call of Duty or Halo, since there's no functional difference.  Fans of stealth, deliberation, strategy and care:  stay away.	2015-08-25

Pretty much cheap is the only good thing about it and it will feel cheap when you use it.  The throttle is more like a switch, no force it's just click forward or click back.  The joystick felt nice, however.  The only real drawback is the throttle.  It will not give you that immersive feeling.  It will feel as if you simply flipped a switch.	2015-08-25

At the same time there are so many options when it comes to a certain niche market products that it’s often so hard for a buyer to find the best bang for the buck. This is much the mind-set I went out with when I went out looking for a wireless headset.<br /><br />My shortlist ironically turned out to be quite long and I was faced with what I’d like to call the BBB dilemma (Best Bang for Buck). BTW ,with me this feeling can get quiet chronic with and it often leaves me procrastinating and can even escalate to full withdrawal from my intention to buy.<br /><br />Upgrading from: Logitech G330, a really nice headset, good value. After about 1 year of use it  developed a known issue with one of the speakers where it would stop working or distort when the cable is twisted in a certain position. I would imagine that this was fixed on later versions or that Logitech offered some form of compensations for this with other customers, but I've never really had a chance to notify Logitech (more on this later).<br /><br />Reasons for the upgrade:<br />To fuel my complicated lifestyle I spend lots of time gaming of which a lot goes into playing a game called EVE Online which by choice often involves long (sometimes uninterrupted) PVP sessions of up to 3 hours. I get off my chair during gameplay to grab something in the kitchen, deal with dogs or give attention to my wife but at the same time to avoid a galactic ingame catastrophe I need to stay on comms with my teammates. A wireless headset would be the perfect solution to keep the volatile EVE universe in balance. ;-p<br /><br />I’ve put together a list of requirements and an overflow of nice to haves that I ended up with.<br /><br />Requirements:<br />•Wireless Range - range to extend reasonably in the area of kitchen (7 meters/23 feet) or living room (6 meters/20 feet) each divided by one wall.<br />•Wireless Rechargeable - to be able to recharge while using if battery runs out.<br />•Wireless Battery Life - use up to 3 hours before recharge is required<br />•PC Compatible<br />•Good Sound Quality (including speakers and microphone)<br />•Comfort - comfy fit for up to 4 hours of gaming<br />•Build Quality - One of my earlier headsets, the Cyber Snipa SONAR 5.1 was a great headset with awesome sound, especially the bass quality was superb but, one of the hinges where the earcups attached broke off within less than 8 months of general use. I need something that can perhaps endure some short periods of rage and occasional outbursts of frustration during gaming; ok, I may be exaggerating, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Nice to Have:<br />• Price tag $100 or less<br />• Multi-platform compatibility with Playstation 3 and/or Xbox<br />• Surround sound<br />• Removable Microphone<br /><br />Given my requirements and generally high expectations it was a fair challenge to find what I was looking for. After lots of research, procrastination and several withdrawals while deciding on a headset, our cute little puppy ate the earcups off the Logitech G330; you can guess what happened next.<br /><br />So, did the Gioteck EX-06 meet my requirements and expectations? Well, let’s look at the list.<br /><br />Wireless Range – 8/10 It reaches the kitchen and living room on most occasions but understandably if I open the fridge with my head halfway in to grab another brew, the signal distorts.<br /><br />Wireless Rechargeable – 10/10 It met my requirement perfectly, the only thing I can fault was the length of the cable but with a USB hub built into my keyboard I’m able to get close enough to use the headset while it’s charging. The cable is a standard micro USB cable so if I ever really needed to I can go purchase a longer cable from the local electronic shop.<br /><br />Wireless Battery Life 9/10 - The battery life is really good, it exceeded my needs. I’ve been using it for about 11 months with average daily use up to 6 hours, the lifespan of the battery seems reasonable thus far. I get about 4-5 hours of use from a single charge; from what I’ve observed the wireless life hasn’t diminished since the day I received it. The only reason I’m giving a 9/10 is because I can’t really score on it just yet as I haven’t used the product long enough to provide an honest opinion on the battery life, and from what I know it cannot be replaced if it’s at the end of it’s life.<br /><br />PC Compatible 10/10 - I use it on windows and haven’t had any trouble with drivers or setup. I’ve played a few games like Battlefield 3, Total War: Rome II, GTA V and EVE Online and haven’t come across any compatibility issues yet.<br /><br />Good Sound Quality 9/10 - I can’t fault the sound quality from requirements perspective, the bass is really good and the overall quality is actually quite impressive for a headset within this price range so I’d say it’s great value for money. Some ability to fine tune would be nice. One thing I’ve noticed when using it on surround mode is that the bass is not as well tuned as with normal stereo mode.<br />I’ve recorded myself with the microphone and overall, the replay sounds good, it’s not wow but with what the general gamer uses it for you don’t need more than what it offers. I’ve never heard any complaints from my team mates that they couldn’t hear me or anything like that, in fact I’ve only received compliments on the quality when I asked what the clarity was like on the receiving end.<br /><br />Comfort 7/10 - Due to the rigid build quality it doesn’t fit as snug as most headsets I’ve tried in the past however it is a remarkably better than the Logitech G330 which I used.<br /><br />Build quality 10/10 - The build quality on this thing is absolutely unheard of. Every component looks and feels firm, and this was one of the biggest selling points when I decided on a headset. I don’t think many tech products come from the UK but this one really echoes what other British brands offer consumers.<br /><br />Overall Verdict 9/10 - I am very happy with this product, I can’t speak for the other options as I haven’t tried them yet but for me, this was the best bang for my buck. It’s not perfect but with everything you buy there will be trade-offs you will need to make like, with comfort there will almost always be some compromise on build quality and/or price. Eventually you just have to find the right balance in your list of requirements.lly needed to I can go purchase a longer cable from the local electronic shop.<br /><br />Wireless Battery Life 9/10 - The battery life is really good, it exceeded my needs.

Might be some spoilers if you're not 150+ (even more actually. There are some deep spoilers right off the bat. Even with some of the trailers. So tread LIGHTLY if you are a new comer to the series.) episodes in, if you look in the terms glossary and character gallery. Some later information is revealed right off the bat. So proceed with caution.  If you're not a fan of One Piece though, this wouldn't be the way to catch up in the series. Yes it covers most of the main Arks, but there are handfuls of memorable scenes that are just written over. Like they didn't even introduce Axe Morgan's Son. The Sub isn't hard to read, the map is very well detailed. You can also change the map.  You can get used to what the &#34;Something is getting attacked!&#34; or &#34;You gotta go there!&#34; alerts that go on.   The online system is great. It's easy to find a match, haven't had a lot of lag issues. Only once. Probably on my end.  The online system feels rewarding. It keeps up to progress with your story mode just like free-mode progress does.   It'd be best to catch up on the show, then play the game for fun.	2015-08-25

I bought this ps3 version because I also own a ps3 and I let my family borrow my wii console. I wish you could choose the character you want to dance to on the screen but some routines have a male dancer and some have a female dancer. I feel I just don't like to dance the male dance routine's as much since I relate more to the female dancer as that is what I am. also I have noticed that in one dance song I can't recall the name of it at the moment it seem's the dance and song are a bit off sync (both the wii and ps3 versions have this on the same routine).  It has many songs/routines to choose from, you can dance to single song's or choose to do 20min, 45 min or more of dance pileups for a full workout. I also saw there is a dance party section where you can dance and compete with other people who own the ps3 version of Zumba party also but there never seems to be anyone on there to compete with so I just stopped clicking on that. This game included the zumba belt but honestly I don't think its absolutely necessary to play the game, I find I get a higher score if I don't use the belt and just hold the controller. I recommend this game for anyone who likes to dance to latin music.	2015-08-25

My Game of the Year For 2015.	Chilling, well acted and with a lot of jump scares. It's just like watching a scary '80s-'90s horror movie (very much an homage to classics such as Scream, The Descent, Saw, or The Cabin In The Woods), but you control the action, and this &quot;movie&quot; is over 8 hours long. Although the game mechanics are very different, in terms of theme, quality, and how each playthrough can result in different characters surviving, it's similar to the classic Xbox 360 game &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;.<br /><br />The first few minutes really gets you emotionally involved in the plot, and while the plot setup is a bit forced, it works in terms of the scary movie genre that the game is paying homage to. The introduction is slow-paced (not for those with a short attention span), but for the rest of us, the tension starts right away, and it does not let up for a moment. The game really gets the atmosphere right. Also, you care for each character, and while it's true that some of them are not wholly likeable (in horror movie tradition, some are immature and they can be unkind, self-centered or unthinking), you really feel as if you want to get them all through the horror that is about to overtake them.<br /><br />The game controls are simple, intuitive and effective, and movement is smooth. The graphics are amazing, from the facial textures to the snowfall, lighting and shadows, this game really takes advantage of this latest generation of consoles to bring out detail and atmosphere. Music is very atmospheric and extremely well integrated into the action. The clues and collectibles in the game are very effective, and the in-game menus work well to help the player assess how well he is doing. During the action sequences, the player needs to make split-second decisions and controller inputs, and in my opinion (speaking as an older but experienced gamer) these are perfectly balanced to appeal to players of most abilities.<br /><br />Replay value is wholly focused on survival, not on a branching plot. This is not a bad thing: while the overarching plot remains fixed, the fate of each character is very much decided by your actions and choices: any character or all of them can die. Conversely, any or all can be saved, but saving everyone is very hard: I only saved two of the eight characters the first time around (Sam and Emily). I'm looking forward to restarting in the hope that I can somehow get at least a few more people through &quot;until dawn&quot;.<br /><br />The most innovative aspect of the game is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;: a build-up of small, seemingly insignificant changes that may have devastating consequences down the line. This feature shows itself even in the first play through, as an in-game menu screen tells you which decisions you've made and gives subtle hints as to how you're doing. It's not just the illusion of choice - if you mess up too often, friends may become enemies, making it harder for characters to survive. Sometimes, a small mistake will be recoverable, but the mistakes do mount up, and sometimes the choices made leave no way out. At the game's end the sun rises, but who will be there to see it is up to you.<br /><br />My only criticisms so far (all but the first one are very minor nitpicks):<br />1: It's a PS4 exclusive. I know, it's just business, but I think everyone should be able to play it on whatever platform they happen to own. Sony's sales of their console should be based on how good their hardware is, not on how many games they can offer as exclusives.<br />2: The camera sometimes doesn't feel as if it's showing enough of the scenes, and it can make movement tricky in darker areas, but then again, that may be a conscious decision because of the need for a survival horror game to be claustrophobic.<br />3: The voices are sometimes out of sync with the characters' mouth movements (happens a lot when replaying chapters).<br />4: The characters' heads seem kinda wobbly at some points (it's obvious during the map scene in the basement). It's very subtle, but it is noticeable.<br />5. There is no way to adjust the screen size in the game - on my TV it's still playable, but some items on the screen edges are clipped.<br />6. The pre-order DLC is just a small inconsequential scene tacked on to the end of chapter 2. It's almost like a deleted scene in a movie and it kinda messes with the pacing. I was kind of expecting a little more.<br />7. Each character's menu screen shows how that character is getting along with the others, but while this is nice, it isn't really clear how this is factored into game play or how (or if) you can rebuild a faltering relationship. On the other hand, maybe making it too clear would make the game too easy.<br /><br />Common criticisms I've seen:<br />1. It's &quot;just&quot; an interactive movie. Okay, even if that were the case, so what? It's a great experience and a lot of fun. But the criticism has no merit - unlike most interactive movies, this one keeps the player fully engaged. At no time did I feel like I could sit back, uninvolved, and just watch the drama play out.<br />2. Two of the characters are predestined to get to the final scene. The developers sometimes mask this with quick time events that focus on saving other characters. Is this a flaw? I'm not sure. However, I think it's a better solution than the alternative, which is a game that would end very quickly for less skilled players.<br /><br />Pre-release hype for this game was unaccountably low. At a guess, Sony's marketing team just didn't know how to sell the game, so it received the minimum pre-release advertising. I'm guessing some marketing executives are being slowly tortured to death in Sony's secret underground lair.<br /><br />Altogether, I had a blast with this game, and I think a lot of other players will too, even if this type of game is not their usual fare. For me, this is not just one of the best survival horror games I've ever played, but if it were a movie, I'd say it would be the best horror movie since The Cabin in the Woods. Yeah, it's that good. I will be very surprised if this game doesn't gather a few of the most prestigious Game of the Year awards.e map scene in the basement). It's very subtle, but it is noticeable.<br />5.

Returning.  Edit: Got a replacement, and the light doesn't blink anymore.  So this cable is better (I'm guessing for $3.99 we'll get a few badly made cables).  However, the charging light never turns off even after leaving the ds overnight on a 1A Apple iPhone charger (that was the closest thing I could find to the 900mA from a USB output).  When I look manually in the DS's settings to see its battery life, it looks like it charges fine.  As we know, continuing to charge Lithium Ion after its done charging isn't good for the battery, so I hope that's not happening when the charge light stays on....	2015-08-25

This was probably one of the best buys I've ever done - value wise. I mean, you can wither get a 500gb version for $345 or pay the extra $45 and get 1TB (double the storage?) The 500gb console can probably hold like 20 games while this can hold a ton. I have both Halo and Far Cry 4 on this beautiful disaster and I have only used 11% of the capacity. Being Far Cry is like 20gb and MCC is like 60gb. Not to mention the operating system and files for the console take up more space than the games.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with the 1TB. There is no reason to get 500G now this model is out. Unless you're seriously strapped for cash it's a harder decision, but if your so strapped - don't buy a console.<br /><br />As for Halo bundled with it, the game is actually not very good. It'll take you ages to get into a lobby and the single layer campaigns are just plain boring. I only play co-op on the story for this reason. It seems like the stories are all there to just grind out the 6k achievements you get for doing them.	2015-08-25

Currently I'm rating this a one star because it's faulty on release. I'll keep updating as days past. Hopefully this doesn't keep happening.<br /><br />*** UPDATE *** 8/26/2015<br /><br />Game stopped freezing as of today. The glitch could of been EA servers causing a timeout issue when Tuning is being updated? I'll update my review once I play a few days of it.<br /><br />*** UPDATE **** 8/31/2015<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />- Graphics are enhanced, but nothing &#34;wowing&#34;.<br />- GUI is revamped and is a little smoother.<br />- Animations have been improved to match physics.<br />- The ignite engine is finally showing itself on the Xbox One.<br />- Gang tackling is not limited by a certain amount of players. It's a nice touch!<br />- Different perspective views for replies and highlights.<br />- The new &#34;battle in the air&#34; is exciting. I love how the WR's and defenders go at it.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />- MUT is still terrible in my opinion. It's All About The Microtransactions. Current roster and fantasy roster game play is where it's at.<br />- Sound effects are basically the same. It's nothing thrilling.<br />- The songs are terrible! I disabled all the &#34;songs&#34;. It's far by the worst Madden music.<br />- Commentary is recycled from the last 3 Maddens.<br />- Throwing mechanics are still terrible.<br />- Players (One cut RB's, speed players etc.) don't feel fluid.<br />- They claimed to fix the off sides glitch. It still occurs...a lot. Other bugs and glitches occur BUT hopefully patches fix these.<br />- Rosters are not accurate. Some players are missing and some shouldn't be in Madden this year.<br />- The load times are insane. I know content has increased because of the &#34;next generation of Madden&#34; but this shouldn't be happening to this extent. Load times come from bloatware coding and copy/pasting old generation code.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />Madden 2016 is decent...at best. EA tries to create or bring back &#34;new content&#34; but they almost always fail to execute. Also, EA keeps recycling content over, over and over. It's 2015, almost 2016. Fans want great sound effects, attention to detail (not grass), commentary and overall realistic football game play. We don't care for MUT (some may though) and bogus microtransactions as content in a football game! I've been playing Madden since it's 1992 edition on Sega. I stopped playing Madden in 2004 when NFL 2K5 arrived (It sucks it only lasted a year. EA knew it would lose Madden and took actions on purchasing NFL licenses etc) . However, I came back to Madden when the 2010 edition was released. Now about 6 years later...I think it's time to stop giving $60 to EA for Madden.er, over and over. It's 2015, almost 2016.

For some reason I hadn't ever tried the Mario Party series even though I really enjoy Muppet Party Cruise, Pac Man World and Monkey Ball. Great, wonderful, family and friend fun!!!	2015-08-25

That IW is a colossal step down I won't deny. The two biggest pains in the patoot being the tiny-as-fudgeknuckle box-shaped locations to explore providing far too many visits to the often broken loading screen and the writing itself heading into the fantastical, away from the recognizable and richly-detailed world of the first DX (gone are all the e-mails and most literature and admirable characters--& Pacotti/Grossman's high-quality dialogue with Australian-Chinese bartenders and hidden AI prototypes are limited to just a few instances like with the NG Resonance AI).<br /><br />BUT: The game's still addictive; the story's stil strong enough to draw you in, and some levels, most notably the Egyptian arcology, are top notch (if you look past the loading screens); the goofy physics of objects and ragdolls are fun to mess around with; the graphics have held up well; and it's beyond satisfying to snoop around and knock out 2-dimensional villains with one baton swing to the face.	2015-08-25

It reduced the characters down to stereotypes, making some characters, like Teddie, insufferable. The story is nearly non-existant and replaces S. Links with short cut scenes, leaving major sections without any character interaction or plot development. The combat is awful, getting rid of the 1more system in favor of boost, which was a poorly conceived downgrade. The characters go as a group instead of one by one, so many times a healer would heal themselves because their target died before their turn. I didn't hate the game at first. Even with paper thin characters and downgraded combat, I was enjoying the experience. The date cafe was a particularly fun dungeon that paired you with any character, including the other protagonist. That was right before I realized what this game really is though. Grinding. I watched five hours of cut scenes (which is insultingly low for a persona game), fifteen hours of exploring the dungeons and doing puzzles, and seventy hours of grinding. Persona 3 and 4 were both balanced to make grinding a last resort if you skipped too many fights. Here, it's basically essential if you even want a chance to beat the game. Reducing difficulties does nothing, so this is basically a minimum time requirement to beat the game if you don't exploit the auto-death spells like everyone kept telling me when I asked about the insane time. If I have to exploit poor gameplay to get through the game in a reasonable time, the game is doing something wrong. Do not waste money on this. Buy Persona 4 Arena Ultimax instead, which has DLC for the first games story. It is at least has 200 times more story, the characters aren't cardboard cutouts of their previous selves, and it's a pretty forgiving fighting game with the auto-combo system.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KBD4SJA Persona 4 Arena Ultimax - PlayStation 3]]	2015-08-25

The headphones don't necessarily bring surround sound capability but with the DSS2 chip it really brings out the quality in the headset! The dss2 chip alone is almost $50 and the p11's are around $35-40 so for the price that u are getting the set for is unbeatable! My brother has a pair of headphones with multiple speakers on each side specially designed for a surround sound experience and they work beautifully. They even let u plug up your phone for music thru your gaming sound! There EQ presets that are pretty good and the different levels of surround sound make gaming experience epic!

Pretty much exactly the same, except for being (obviously) much prettier and the ability to select difficulty. Normal on this game equates to the challenge of the first. Had a blast reliving this game. One thing of note- I figured my young nephew would love it due to the content, but he actually grew tired of it pretty quickly. In part because he's never seen the show but also because he's used to more advanced gameplay. The side-scrolling platfomer just didn't hold his attention. If your a fan of the original then this a must have for the older gamer, especially if you can get it for under $8.	2015-08-25

I'm so glad it does not have the ridiculous &#34;boss battles&#34; from Far Cry 3 that required me to hit various keys in an exact sequence.  Those were a 100% buzz kill!  This game is very similar while being far more engaging and immersive.  Yeah, the radio towers and the crafting are, dare I say it, a little silly.  And the friggin' wildlife is over the top homicidal!  Having a pint-sized dog chase me across a field growling and snapping while I'm bristling with military grade guns and knives is a hoot.  And those eagles!  Has anyone told the game makers that these are carrion birds?  They might stoop on a river trout, but they DO NOT go around raking anything that is likely to fight back with their claws!  It's like they are all having the worst hair (or feather) day of their lives.  But ignore all of this and give the game a try.  If you like open world style adventure games that have tactically oriented FPS action, this is what you want.  Having finished Just Cause 2 recently, I found this to be a large improvement.	2015-08-25

Too much repetitiveness in the missions.  The darkness portion of the missions are especially a pain.  Get killed and you have to go back to the beginning and all the enemies you've already killed will respawn.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the ammo you've used.  Aggravating.  The MMORP aspect of the game seems kind of light.  If you're playing single player its even lighter.  If you don't have an internet connection and at least an xbox live silver acct, do not buy this game because you're not going to be playing it.  At all.  If your xbox 360 doesn't have more than a 4gb hard drive - do not buy this game because you cant even install it.  I'm glad I waited until the priced dropped, if I'd have paid full price for this game I'd have felt violated.  There's just too many other - better shooters out there that tell a more compelling and coherent story.  Destiny seems to have collapsed under the weight of it's own ego.	2015-08-25

US	40390924	R9ZQONHDW0M6H	B00ZOETH8I	564802366	Dishonored Definitive Edition	Video Games	5	7	10	N	N	Pretty good.	This game is a 4.5. The core gameplay is fantastic. The ps3 to ps4 upgrade is very nice and very appreciated.  The issue at hand here is the port or remaster, whatever you want to call it. There are great remasters out there. Tomb Raider from PS3 to PS4 is one of them. I still know some PC gamers that are jealous because the PS4 Definitive Tomb Raider is better than their PC Tomb Raider. As for PS4 Dishonored, if you have a high end PC and a PS4, just stick with the Dishonored PC that you already have. But to answer the question, is this PS4 Dishonored better than PS3 Dishonored. Yes, very much so. Graphically.  There are some great port jobs out there. TLOU, GTAV. PS3 to PS4, you can tell worlds of difference. I hear the Prototype PS3 to PS4 port is no good. I played Sleeping Dogs PS3 and PS4 versions. On that version, I can see the minor improvements. Improvements though minor makes a huge difference when you're playing a game for hours. I would say Dishonored gets a B+ on the port job. They could have done better, but I appreciate the end product they came up with.  Definitive editions tend to price drop like a brick fairly fast. I bought this game brand new at Gamestop just this morning and have been playing it and having a blast doing so. You can wait till this game hits your price point, but yes, this game is a must buy if you don't have a souped up PC to play it in.  Watch PS4 gameplay on twitch and or live from playstation. You can see the difference between the ps3 and ps4 versions. Draw distance is much better. Textures are slightly improved. Lines are finer. It still has an oil painting quality to it. You can still tell the old gen roots in the game. Overall, Highly recommend.  P.S. When the heart tells you secrets, you can hear it in the Dualshock speakers. How cool is that?	2015-08-25

This is the best madden in a good long time, and while not without flaws, there are a host of improvements.  Positives:  - Visuals are fantastic. Players look great and hell even the coaches actually look good. They almost exactly capture Tom Coughlins ancient insect monster look.  -Presentation is vastly improved. There are many new on screen indicators, including catching controls, player milestones and xp gains. The instant visual feedback is very satisfying.  -Commentary doesn't suck for once. Most of the commentary isn't repetitive drivel and is actually accurate. I haven't ran into that moment where you hit your receivers in the hands and he drops it and it's referred to as a &#34;terrible throw by the quarterback&#34; or you accidently throw it right at a defender and it's called &#34;a great play by the secondary player.&#34;  -Most of the bugs have been ironed out. For example I was always annoyed in franchise mode when it gave your players stats from last week and each stat had a 0. That's been fixed. Also most of the funky animation issues have been ironed out.  -Animations are great  -It now takes a realistic amount of time for the offense to run a no huddle, so that can't be spammed as often anymore.  -New mechanics on offense and defense are interesting and work well. Back are the great defensive changes from last year but added to it are new mechanics for the qb, receivers and secondary players. In addition to the traditional bullet and lob passes, you have a touch pass, which is between a bullet and lob and is useful for things like slant patterns. In addition you can aim high or low with the left trigger and bumper, respectively. Now one on one patterns have added depth as you can aim it high and have your receiver go up and get it. This adds excitement to deep routes and makes fades actually work.  As for receivers there are now three options on how to catch the ball. If you want to just make sure the ball is caught, you can press a(x) and he willcommit to catching the ball but the odds for yards after catch are low. If you press x (square) you will attempt a run after catch, useful for when you're wide open and want to maximize yardage. And if you press y (triangle) you will do an agressive catch which is great for one on one situations and if you just want to see some highlight reel stuff.  As for the secondary, while in coverage you have the option to play either the ball for an int or the receiver and try to prevent the catch.  -There are some minor changes to MUT and franchise. While not major they do clean up the experience a bit.  -The cover athlete. This didn't actually affect my rating but what can I say? I'm a giants fan.  Negatives:  -Some old issues persist, for example if you get outbid when in an auction house sometimes your coins won't return in time to make a bid. It's an annoyance I had last year and while it's slightly less frequent, it persists and sometimes you have to exit the auction house and reenter just to get your coins back. You can imagine how much of a nuisance that is when you only have 15-20 seconds to place a bid.  -Little change to the old modes and the new one, draft champions isn't all that compelling. At least in my opinion. Other people seem to enjoy it, so take that with a grain of salt. I would love for them to bring back the old practice modes like throwing the ball through rings. Those were a ton of fun.  - There were some issues that seem to have been only present during the 5 day ea access preview. For example during that time there were frequent performance issues, particularly frame rate drops. Also there was an issue where all my MUT cards, including those opened in packs, were blank. However since release, the frame rate has been stable and the blank card issue corrected, so I don't anticipate those being an issue any longer.  -The soundtrack isn't anything to write home about. Can't Feel my Face is my jam, but for the most part the music is pretty unremarkable,again in my opinion.  Overall this Madden was a pretty pronounced improvement over the previous which in turn was a nice improvement over 25. I feel right now the gameplay experience is about as good as it can be. Next year I would instead like to see an emphasis on improving existing game modes and introducing a nice amount of new ones. Maybe a story mode NBA 2K style. That would be freaking sweet.	2015-08-25

I am truly addicted to it , you can play this mode to and also have at least one legend each draft. I have been playing it and it also helps with my MUT team as far as being able to use guys for FREE and determine if I like how they perform on the field,not to mention you get rewards to help you in MUT as well. Its a great and addicting FREE mode that I can't get enough of.<br /><br />In MUT there are more solos and challenges you can play , more content as well.  I am not totally won over with MUT as far as payouts , odds and how the leaderboard is still done by coins and not wins or a points setup but its still a great mode that has more to offer this year and I will have fun playing. While its not setup exactly how i'd prefer I think overall it has improved which tells me there are going in the right direction.<br /><br />Overall , the gameplay is much smoother and improved , the addition of draft champions is alone a game in itself that could keep me busy for months , MUT has improved and the new interactions between the DB's and WR's are a welcome addition as well, when a game moves forward I am always happy.	2015-08-25

This game represents some of the worst that the recent remaster trend has to offer. Unlike most remasters the definitive edition does not seem to increase performance in any notable way, with the game running at 1080p (I think lol its hard to tell with the awful textures) and a sub 30 frame rate. Let me be clear, I like this game, and the definitive edition doesn't really hurt the game, but it doesn't make it any better. As such people who have already played the game on the last gen consoles don't really have a good reason to pick this up, aside from this game's other main selling point which is that it includes all of the dlc for the main game. For a limited time people who owned the original version of the game actually get the definitive edition for $20 as opposed to it's regular $40 selling price. For that price this supposed remaster may be worth it for the dlc assuming you haven't already played them.	2015-08-25

It's basically a light novel with music videos thrown in every once and a while. It's a pretty bland experience for a Neptunia game, but there's nothing to be offended about. If you want to spend 3 hours with your favorite Neptunia character, it's a nice time waster. If you want an in depth idol raising game, I'm assuming there are better. I've never have, or will, play another Idol game because it doesn't look interesting. The Music videos seem complex, but once you realize that moving the camera continuously gives you nonstop points, it becomes about wiggling the camera instead of capturing a good video. I heard it was impossible to lose and I did have to basically force my idol into retirement by never letting her rest to get the bad ending. I can't see you using up all the days up even if you tried. It's a simple game with a simple goal and simple execution. So I give it the simple rating of two stars or four out of ten. I judge 5 as a standard game, so it's worth a look, but don't expect much.	2015-08-25

I've played them all since PS1 days and this one isn't the best, but it's definitely far from the worst of them.  The only real disappointment is the lack of options and choice.  You're spoon feed ships and tracks in single player and have no way of doing any form of quick race.  The racing is just as enjoyable as the Wipeout games from PS3, HD and Fury.	2015-08-25

Crashes constantly (almost regularly after a level is completed), and also doesn't keep some settings (like brightness), so it has to be set again.

The microphone on this headset seems fine, and the fit was decent (still a little tight for my large head), but the audio quality was much lower than other headphone sets I've used. Even the headphones that came with my iPhone had better audio than this headset. The sound was very boomy and bass-heavy, to the point where I felt like I was listening to my game through a closed door. I could hear what was going on, but it felt much less crisp and more detached from the game. It felt like I was playing with a head cold.	2015-08-25

I really loved how the controllers plug into the top of the stand with an audible click sound. It makes it very easy to just pop your controller in and walk away after a gaming session. But after only a few weeks I discovered that the left side dock would not charge my controllers. That really bummed me out since I otherwise love this charger stand. It could have been busted right out of the box since I don't tend to use the second controller much, but I think it's too late to swap anyway.	2015-08-25

Career mode is quite bland however. This biggest disappointment though, and it is BIG, is the TERRIBLE car selection. If you care at all about which makes and models you will drive in this game do not get the essentials edition. Literally EVERY iconic car from 1990 to current is not included. Examples include 300zx, 300GT, S15, Murcielago, Aventador, RX7, ect... Also there are NO PORSCHES at all. There is a porsche pack that you have to buy.  It's shameful for microsoft to exclude the best part of the franchise just to charge $3 per car  in the online store DLC. If you are interested in cars of any kind, you should get the full version, even though it is grossly overpriced as well compared to previous forzas.	2015-08-25

Let me just say that I think what the Revo K101+ can do is neat, but so far I have had some bad experiences with it which also led to a poor experience with the creator.<br /><br />Pros: Rom playback, screen brightness, video output<br /><br />Cons: Soft plastic (like most Chinese items) which easily scratches<br />GBA resolution is actually stretched about 50% to fill the screen (more pixelated image)<br />Buttons are not as responsive as the GBA(seems to be a farther press to get an input in game)<br />Some of the buttons seem to stick if you slide your finger off of a depressed button<br />My audio port fell off of the PCB board just from plugging in headphones<br /><br />My Story:<br />I ordered one on May 15th, 2015 and it arrived until August 11th, 2015. Nearly 2 months! I suppose there must be only one guy working on these. I am not sure.<br /><br />When it arrived, I realized that it did not come with everything listed on the website. The screen protector and earbuds were not included. I thought it was a minor issue so I ignored it. I was happy that it finally arrived. I first tested the video output on my TV and it worked as expected. It's my favorite feature. Next, I tested out the roms that were included and everything worked well. I mainly want to play original Gameboy games.<br /><br />I then decided to check out how the audio works with my headphones. This is where the problems begin. I go to plug in my 1/8&#34; audio jack and the entire port goes straight into the console like it was barely attached to the motherboard. I immediately contacted the creator and it took me 3 days to get him to understand what happened. I'm aware of the language barrier so I had to be patient with him.<br /><br />Once he finally understood, I asked for a replacement, but he told me that he couldn't do that and that I would have to sell it to someone who wouldn't mind a missing audio port. I told him that was not acceptable for a defective item and then he offered me $5 offmy next order of the Crystal Black model. We went about 10 days of back and forth emails. I just wanted to return it and he just sending me a replacement when the next batch rolls out. He refused everything I asked him and he eventually sent me a measly $10 refund to my Paypal. After all of the frustration, I just accepted it. I know I could have disputed through Paypal, but that would have taken weeks and required me to pay $10 just to return ship. I thought it was best to just deal without an audio port.<br /><br />I ended up taking it apart to remove the audio port that was rattling around inside and I noticed that there is very little solder on most of the contacts. I may attempt to solder it back on, though I have little skills to do so.<br /><br />I just want to let everyone know that quality is not guaranteed with the Revo K101+. The creator was not rude, but I had a difficult time getting my problem solved for the broken audio port.	2015-08-25

An open world game where your actions decide the course of the future... Fallout 3 is probably one of the greatest games of all time. The pacing is perfect for any style of gamer that likes role playing games. You can find many hours of entertainment and replay ability with all of the choices that are presented during game play. The box includes the game one one disc and all the DLC on another disc, so its perfect for offline play. You can choose to install it to your hard drive and it takes around 2GB of open space for the DLC. You can easily get over 50 hours of entertainment from this game, which makes it well worth the money you spend on it.	2015-08-25

Skyrim is beautiful and harsh, it is ambitious and buggy, but that is why it is the best RPG to date and one of the best video games to date. Bethesda is no newbie to the RPG world and Skyrim is the fifth installment of an already very well developed video game franchise and virtual world. Tamriel is a huge land full of rich history, lore, legends and adventures and Skyrim further developes Tamriel even more than it already is. Skyrim is easy to play, easy to learn and really tailors well to individual styles of play. Skyrim is a true Open World game and one of my favorites in the genre (only surpassed by Fallout: New Vegas because the amount of control you have over the events and outcomes of that game is astounding). Skyrim has a wonderful and rich storyline and gameplay. It can easily entertain for 200+ hours on just the base game. That being said it is worth the extra money to buy the legendary edition - you won't regret it. The legendary edition adds hundreds more hours of game play not to mention a separate land (Solstheim) and 2 separate worlds (Soul Cairn and the Forgotten Vale)  and the ability to build your own house (within limits). I own Skyrim on 2 platforms the base game on the Xbox 360 and the Legendary edition on the PC. I would strongly advise that you buy Skyrim for the PC. If PC has the ability to play Skyrim than mods can really rejuvenate and enhance a 4 year old game and make it feel new again not to mention add hundreds of hours to game play, improve game play, fix bugs, and allows you even more customization than you already had to begin with. So if you ever need a new game to play Skyrim is the way to go. Always.	2015-08-25

I got two guitars. On one of them, the strumming button only worked in the down position, up did not function. On the other, the cord was frayed near where it connected to the guitar. There was sticker glue all over it as well. Not pleased overall really. It did not contain the adapters to connect to Xbox 360 because of the USB ports either so anticipate an added expense for those.	2015-08-25

Lets start by saying this is a solid football sim that gives us something that is better then nothing. With no competition it really is hard for EA to innovate anything ground breaking. Some people will get excited for the new pass catching buttons. However if you play on All-Pro or above they add little to nothing in value. Half the time the button you press isn't what happens anyway. The New fantasy draft mode is fun once or twice but isn't something we will all be playing 6 months from now. Micro-transaction Ultimate football is back and as lame as ever. Touted as the most played mode in Madden I don't know a single person who plays Ultimate team mode. If you like paying more money to get into a fantasy draft franchise go for it the rest of us are laughing at you.<br /><br />Honestly Madden has because something of a standard then a trend setter. You get what you expect with a few new fresh coats of paint each year. Its not a bad game, it doesn't deserve 1, 2 or even 3 stars. Its a solid 4 star experience that needs some competition to push it to the next level. If you can wait until November the game will be 10-20 bucks cheaper as it is every year.<br /><br />With all that said I have to recommend EA Access for nothing else than the Discount on games. I went in thinking that the 10 hour trial wasn't worth the 5 bucks I paid for EA Access however when I purchased Madden from the Xbox live store I only paid $53.00. Essentially it saved me 2 bucks and I got the trial free.	2015-08-25

I like the new feature where you can having your receiver be aggressive or defensive back the same way. I like it. It's seems very smooth. Some of the Ratings aren't the best. Dez Bryant lower than Brown. I got mine at $%#% where when you traded in your copy they game you 30 off for it. So it was only 30 bucks after all said and done. I don't play the players so it isn't worth my while to buy the limited edition. The franchise mode is about the same. A feel bells and whistles, Haven't Dived into it yet. I like the old versions, If it was like the show to some extent it would be amazing and I would play it all the time. With that being said. I like the game so far. They need to over haul the franchise mode though	2015-08-25

On the other hand, this gives it a trimmer shape. Currently hard to find -- it's a first generation depth sensor based on structured light rather than time-of-flight.

This headset is the single worst customer experience I have had in my life.<br /><br />It broke within 2 months of opening it, when only using it a few times a week. I sent it in for warranty replacement, and it has been there ever since. They sent back a broken replacement without the cables, then they sent the wrong cable, then I sent everything back again and I still have no headset. I paid nearly $400 dollars, and I have literally nothing to show for it but frustration. The warranty case with turtle beach was opened on June 19. Months later, I still have no headset. The customer service is atrocious. They are sarcastic and dismissive, and have no idea what they are doing. I am convinced they are only trying to prevent warranty replacements from happening. Here is an actual excerpt from one of the emails they sent me:<br /><br />&#34;The cable you received for use is exactly the same in all functions. Color change and the angle on the plug do not alter its core function, which is why you received it. Thank you for eventually trying to use it so we could verify if your problem was cleared up or not.<br />Is this the exact same problem you had previous? As the full headset was swapped out and the cable as well we want to be sure the acu is not at fault in this case.<br />The XP7 is not available in a finished good replacement fashion. That is partly why we replaced just the headset in the first place as you had indicated an issue with just it.&#34;<br /><br />I can not believe how paying absolute top dollar for a supposed &#34;best of the best&#34; headset has cost me time, money, and left me with nothing. I have been patient, and all I received from Turtle beach are pre-canned messages and outright lies.<br /><br />The headset itself is mediocre at best. The leather was decent enough, but the band is not really adjustable (height but not width) and there is a rattling squeaking noise when you move your head around while wearing it. The audio quality is good - if a bit bass heavy. Clarity is lacking and there are MAJOR issues with the driver and software that the USB ACU use to create the digital surround. I had to use optical audio to get it to properly have separate volume control for chat and talk - so if you don't have optical - this is a bad choice.<br /><br />I would literally buy ANY other headset than this one. This Turtle Beach has been the worst experience I have ever had buying something anywhere, let alone the internet. The company happens to have 27 claims against them with the Better Business Bureau already, and will be getting another shortly.<br /><br />If the technology were the best, it still would not be worth dealing with the company. But the fact is its not even that great of a product to begin with. The mediocre sound and poor craftsmanship (only nice thing is the soft leather) leave you with a bad product for an egregious price. And god forbid you get one of the many lemons they ship out. You will be in warranty replacement hell until you give up.<br /><br />Shame on TurtleBeach, this was my fourth headset I bought from them - but I will never allow anyone I know, not even a complete stranger, to suffer through what I have been through. Please, if you have any self respect at all, if you want a headset that works, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.MAJOR issues with the driver and software that the USB ACU use to create the digital surround.

It's very comfortable and good for fighting games.  I like that the R and L bumper buttons are on the top of the pad next to the ABYX buttons, which is awesome for fighting games.  Also, the D-Pad is actually a joystick/D-Pad hybrid.  Once you get used to it, it makes for really fun gameplay.  The guts are high quality.  I eventually catabolized this controller to built an arcade stick.  Everything works great!  I recommend this to any gamer.	2015-08-25

I was largely disappointed with Thief, but I think that's due to my high hopes and I have played the game Dishonored before I played Thief. (Dishonored is inspired by Thief but it turns out to be far superior in many ways). Deus Ex was phenomenal (Not necessarily a stealth game. Think: if the Fallout series and the Crysis series had a baby, it would be Deus Ex HR) and I have yet to finish Hitman, but it's pretty good as well. As for the physical product, the package includes three disks and no game booklets/instructions. All three disks are mostly black with a big ULTIMATE STEALTH on top with the actual game's name being relatively small, so it takes an extra second to identify which game is which.<br /><br />OVERALL - The above are hardly valid complaints and the Ultimate Stealth Triple Pack is a perfectly acceptable product. Three stars because Thief made me sad.	2015-08-25

Last minute I decided to buy the digital version as I had credit in my MS account and started playing it this morning. First of all the developers have done a labor of love in the restoration of this game, it feels fresh and the graphics and cut scenes are amazing. But most importantly the way it plays reminded me of why GOW was ground breaking at the time and why we all went so crazy about it: incredibly fun to play shooter that literally brought a smile to my face this morning, over and over. Haven't tried coop nor multiplayer yet but cannot wait to later on this week! In my opinion a must have for FPS fans, no matter whether you have played it before or not.	2015-08-25

As a man who never played Halo games, having this bundled in the console I bought seemed like a good idea - wrong. Unless you actually played the Halo games when they first came out, you're going to have a bad time with these games.The story will seem incredibly dull and unless you have a friend to help, you may as well just be making yourself mad just to get the achievements for the games.<br /><br />As for the multiplayer, yeah... no. Needs work. I find myself at the lobby screen having the game &#34;Search for player&#34; more often than I am actually playing the game. However, for me, the multiplayer saves this game from one star. There is just something s satisfying about cruisin around in a warthog gunning down people. Really wish it had Reach though.	2015-08-25

US	9102459	R3A0OAIPIIXZS3	B00MV7KVP4	92208606	Until Dawn  - PlayStation 4 [Digital Code]	Video Games	5	70	79	N	N	A Brilliant Horror Adventure (no spoliers)	Until Dawn is an interactive, story based horror adventure game.  The narrative is well written and is inspired by the 80's and 90's &#34;slasher&#34; horror films (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Saw) as well as supernatural horror.  From the beginning, the characters and the setting are intentionally stereotypical: A group of upper/middle class teenagers in an isolated region of the country side.  Even the character archetypes are all reminiscent of the typical horror flicks that are released around October: The jock, the clown, the arrogant cheerleader, the attractive 'nerdy' girl, the token minority, etc..  The setting for the story is designed in such a way to induce a constant feeling of isolation in the player. Add to this the excellent ambient sound quality plus the top-notch graphics (even by the standards of a PC gamer), and you have for yourself one atmospheric and engaging adventure game.  UD is simply much more than &#34;just another interactive movie.&#34; This is because the optional element of exploration not only fleshes out the details of the main story, but can potentially change its course with regards to death/survival of each character.  Simply put, the more one explores the various dark and eerie areas, the more he/she will feel rewarded.  Another aspect of the game is the knowledge that even the smallest decisions can have drastic consequences.  I will not go into too much detail regarding this &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; for the sake of keeping the review as spoiler-free as possible.  Suffice to say, it is intended to make the player ponder his/her every move and adds replayability to the game.  What UD isn't:  The horror elements in this game are based on the aforementioned movie genre.  Hence, you will witness elements of gore, jump scares, eerie music, mystery, etc...  Do not expect the same type of horror as in games such as Amnesia or Condemned.  The game is also heavily story-driven with simple control mechanics.  The gameplay is not meantto be complex or challenging.  Pros: -Well-written, engaging story -Multiple characters with distinct personalities -Atmospheric and immersive environments -Exploration is rewarding and helps to flesh out the story -Multiple playthroughs yield different outcomes  Cons: -occasional frame rate drops. -Simple gameplay mechanics could possibly turn off the more hardcore gamer -Some might initially find the story/characters too cliche.	2015-08-25

While the physical controller itself feels nice and its sturdy, the software and setting up is a nightmare. I have tried setting it up on 3 different android devices (Note 4, Note 5, Tab A), and got it to work once. Then I maybe reset my phone or something and poof, didn't work ever again. The one time I got it to work, there was a noticeable delay which made it annoying to play any game requiring even the slightest timing, like platformers. Maybe I'm not understanding something, but why is it so damn difficult to set this up in the first place? I have tried the Moga app, several emulators, pretty much all settings combinations, nothing. Even games listed IN THE APP do not respond, I had to request refunds for 2 GTA games, Bards Tale, and some others. I spent hours trying to set this up to no avail. Pass on this product.	2015-08-25

One of the new features that brings a whole new experience to the game is Be the Playmaker. You now have three different catch options to chose from. They are as follows.<br /><br />1. Aggressive catch: This is a high risk/high reward option. Say you are down a score with little time remaining on the clock and need a big play. Using the aggressive catch could provide you the score or yardage needed to win the game. But beware, your receiver has a lower chance of catching the ball. It could however, be just the thing to lead your team to victory.  It's all up to you now.<br /><br />2. Possession catch: You this when you need a clutch pass to your receiver. You most likely won't get any additional yards after the catch but it comes in handy when you need a big play from your QB and receiver.<br /><br />3. RAC Catch: Look to use this play when you need your receiver to make the big play and turn it up the field for more addition yardage after the catch. I would only use this when he's pen because you do have a much bigger chance of throwing an interception id he's cover well.<br /><br />Another new feature in this year's game is called Draft Champions. I will be honest, when I first heard about this new mode of play, I was not impressed at all. I thought, here we go, another new gimmick I won't be playing. I could have not been more wrong. When I fired up the menu, I saw the Draft Champions mode and said, what the heck, I will give it a try. Now, I'm glad I did. If you are a fan and like playing Fantasy Football as much as I do, this is where you will be spending a lot of your gaming hours in Madden NFL 16. It brings the Fantasy Football aspect to Madden in a way that fun and enjoyable to everyone.<br /><br />The Gatorade Skills Trainer Mode: This is a great place to brush up on your Madden skills. Whether you are a long time player of the game like myself or just starting out, you can learn the ins and outs of the game and the new features that were added to Madden NFL 16.<br /><br />The Gauntlet: This mode was first introduced in last year's game. It's basically a series of drills that will help you become a better overall Madden player. It's a great way to try and beat your scores and improve your overall game.<br /><br />Connected Franchise Mode: A lot of new additions to CFM makes this a more enjoyable experience for guys looking to create and control your favorite NFL Franchise. Everything from a new way to scout your players to giving the Commissioner more options to make your online CFM run a lot smoother than year's past. It's still not perfect by any means but it does show promise for future Madden games.<br /><br />Online Head to Head: If you enjoy playing your friends, family or just looking to for a game to play, this is the mode for you. See how you stack up against some of the best Madden players in the world by going online.<br /><br />Ultimate Team Mode: Build your NFL Dream Team in this mode. Long time fans will enjoy yet another Season of MUT in Madden NFL 16. I know a lot of guys will spend a lot of time and effort in creating their Ultimate Team. The more wins you get, the more coins you can earn in order to strengthen your squad.<br /><br />Practice Mode: Need some extra time with your team to learn harness your Madden skills, then practice mode is for you. Learn your team's playbook backwards and forwards by spending time going over your go to plays. It's time well spent if you are a serious Madden gamer.<br /><br />Super Bowl 50: It's the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Arizona Cardinals in this fictional Super Bowl 50 matchup. You can replay this opening of Madden NFL 16 as many times as you want. It's a great way to get a taste of the game.<br /><br />In closing,Madden NFL 16 is just a flat out fun game to play for anyone who has enjoyed previous versions of the Madden series. It's not without is faults however, but has more than enough good traits to keep you coming back for more. This is the game Madden fans have been waiting for. I, for one, am glad Madden Season is finally upon us!	2015-08-25

For anyone accustomed to sports games, they basically know a new year normally means an updated roster, different menus and maybe one or two new features to entice the consumer to pick it up. Madden NFL 16 for the next gen Playstation 4 and Xbox One will contain the new features that are highlighted in commercials and reviews. But for last gen, absolutely nothing is changed. It's the same game as last year, just with a nice hefty sixty dollar price tag. If you own Madden NFL 15, or heck, the last two before that. You're basically getting the same game.<br /><br />If the updated roster means anything then I guess I would barely recommend it. But even then I would suggest waiting for the price to drop. Not everyone can afford the Playstation 4 as of yet, but that shouldn't give EA the right to give consumers an identical copy of last years game and expect players to be happy paying full price for a inferior version. The only other positive of buying the newest Madden on PS3 is that the previous game will have less players to match up against sense its outdated, and having the newer version would most likely give you more opponents to play against.<br /><br />The PS3 like any other last gen console will always get inferior ports until the system retires, it's the way the business works. This review was just meant as a warning to anyone who may not be familiar with EA's lovely practice of releasing carbon copies for everyone to be disappointed in.	2015-08-25

I feel like I have to place a disclaimer at the beginning of this review for those that absolutely love the game and despise anyone who thinks differently: I hope this review doesn't offend you. This is my opinion. Don't get cranky because I don't like this game.<br /><br />With that out of the way, this is another year of EA sucking $60 out of wallets for not much more than upgraded rosters. This is another year where the mechanics of the game feel just like every other Madden game. Another year of these 'new' features promised by EA to 'change the game' when I don't believe that is the case at all. EA has done a great job at 'forcing' consumers to purchase the new game each year just so they can enjoy new rosters. I'm honestly curious as to how many people would actually purchase the game each year if EA offered roster updates for the previous year as well. My guess is that they would lose out on a lot of money. For that reason alone, it makes sense for them to lock down the fact that users have to buy the new game if they want to play with the new people. As a corporation, I get it. As a consumer that has to spend $60 for that being the (for the most part) largest feature each year, it pisses me off.<br /><br />These 'new' additions of Total Control Passing and Integrated Broadcast Graphics are the same features that EA boasts are new and improved each year. If you'll recall from Madden 15, EA released a 'Best of Broadcast' function that claimed to include new broadcast and cameras that capture the emotion of every play from fresh new perspectives. The Integrated Broadcast Graphics of this year claim that the playmaker highlight reel has new player spotlights, dynamic goals and achievements, and innovative on-the-field cameras that bring you closer to the game than ever before. I just feel like EA is beating a dead horse each year, and I'm fed up with it.<br /><br />I find myself buying these games each year with the hope that EA will produce a game that feels fresh and new, deserving of a new $60 rather than pumping out roster updates and claiming to be the newest and best. Unfortunately, this is going to be my last Madden purchase until I see something that is actually game changing. I'll stick with a previous version and just download my own custom rosters that fellow Madden lovers provide to the community.<br /><br />I wish I had positive things to say about this game, but I don't. I'm just tired of pretending that this is a great game just because it's new. Maybe I'm getting older and finding that this isn't what I'm looking for in a new game. Maybe I'm just coming to terms with the fact that the Madden franchise just isn't what it used to be. Whatever the case may be, it pains me to say that I don't like this game, but I'm not scared to admit it anymore.ew $60 rather than pumping out roster updates and claiming to be the newest and best.

Almost a decade ago the original gears came out revolutionizing the gaming industry and setting a new bar for next gen multiplayer gaming. It was the first game to allow you to do in multiplayer exactly what you could do in campaign. It had amazing graphics for its time and  revolutionizing gameplay. This is the version of the game the developers would've loved to release since Emergence Day 2006. Graphics are improved, amazing and so smooth. The gameplay is the same as the original gears (No crazy weapons or frag tagging walls like later gears). A must have for any fan of the series or noobs alike. I don't blame you if you run around chainsawing opponents the first few hours.	2015-08-25

The concept of this product is fantastic, and I didn't have any problems charging my controller. But the micro end broke within 3 days of buying this. I was sitting down and had the controller in my hand and the cable was run under my right knee. I went to stand up and the end damn near snapped off. I have a licensed Sony charger for my PS3 controllers and I can step on it and yank my controller up and it doesn't budge. This product is cheaply made and not worth the investment.

You get a farm where you grow crops, take care of animals, and even several bachelors/bachelorettes to try and charm. The only difference is this game puts more emphasis on cooking, something that either wasn't in the past games I played or I just didn't pay attention to it. The game's relaxing, but it can sometimes get tedious because you're gonna find yourself doing the same things over and over, every day, to keep the farm running.	2015-08-25

Lets just say I was already old when Duke Nukem was released.  What I like about this game series is the story line.  It's not too futuristic and actually it's pretty close to any CIA operator's best case scenario.  So it's fun.  It doesn't demand too much of my time and I get to play it when I'm looking for a good distraction between surgeries.  It takes my mind off the pain and it gives me good reason to NOT take the pain meds - which would make it that much more difficult to stay alive in the game.	2015-08-25

The Kinect in general is pretty fun.  It definitely needs some work, especially if you are a tall guy like me, but it is a lot of fun to play with the family.  I would highly recommend getting a mount for it and placing it over your TV.  That seems to help things out a lot.  As far as Dance Central Spotlight, you could really do without this game.  It is easy to see why it comes free with the Kinect as it is mostly a money grab game.  It comes with 8 songs, and you have to download any other song you want at about $1.99 a piece.  The game doesn't play real well with the Kinect either, you'll spend a lot of time trying to get it to recognize you and your motions.	2015-08-25

Unfortunately, when they say &#34;STARTER Pack&#34;, they are not kidding.  The &#34;Trapmasters&#34;, the major characters, of which there are 18 (one is included in this starter pack), are generally about $15 apiece.  You really need one from each category (or elements in the game) to access all the locked areas.  From what I can tell, about four of them have passed into 'collectible' status, meaning their price is in the $40 range or more if you can find them.<br /><br />Then there are the Traps, $5-6 apiece, ten categories (elements in the game) . . .<br /><br />Then the minor characters . . .<br /><br />Eternal optimist that I am, it is a good game, easy for the player (whatever the age) to become hooked.  Therefore the multitude of characters could be used as bribes, rewards or other persuasion . . . (your mileage may vary . . . )	2015-08-25

In the end 230,948 speakers died in the process.<br /><br />It was not until 1990 when radio shack game along and made peace with the speakers.<br /><br />Anyway the game is terrible 0/6 stars I hope you enjoyed my review.	2015-08-25

This year's game host new features and old favorites that should appeal to anyone who has been a fan of the Madden Series. I will go over all the different modes you have to play. One of the new features that brings a whole new experience to the game is Be the Playmaker. You now have three different catch options to chose from. They are as follows.<br /><br />1. Aggressive catch: This is a high risk/high reward option. Say you are down a score with little time remaining on the clock and need a big play. Using the aggressive catch could provide you the score or yardage needed to win the game. But beware, your receiver has a lower chance of catching the ball. It could however, be just the thing to lead your team to victory.  It's all up to you now.<br /><br />2. Possession catch: You this when you need a clutch pass to your receiver. You most likely won't get any additional yards after the catch but it comes in handy when you need a big play from your QB and receiver.<br /><br />3. RAC Catch: Look to use this play when you need your receiver to make the big play and turn it up the field for more addition yardage after the catch. I would only use this when he's pen because you do have a much bigger chance of throwing an interception id he's cover well.<br /><br />Another new feature in this year's game is called Draft Champions. I will be honest, when I first heard about this new mode of play, I was not impressed at all. I thought, here we go, another new gimmick I won't be playing. I could have not been more wrong. When I fired up the menu, I saw the Draft Champions mode and said, what the heck, I will give it a try. Now, I'm glad I did. If you are a fan and like playing Fantasy Football as much as I do, this is where you will be spending a lot of your gaming hours in Madden NFL 16. It brings the Fantasy Football aspect to Madden in a way that fun and enjoyable to everyone.<br /><br />The Gatorade Skills Trainer Mode: This is a great place to brush up on your Madden skills. Whether you are a long time player of the game like myself or just starting out, you can learn the ins and outs of the game and the new features that were added to Madden NFL 16.<br /><br />The Gauntlet: This mode was first introduced in last year's game. It's basically a series of drills that will help you become a better overall Madden player. It's a great way to try and beat your scores and improve your overall game.<br /><br />Connected Franchise Mode: A lot of new additions to CFM makes this a more enjoyable experience for guys looking to create and control your favorite NFL Franchise. Everything from a new way to scout your players to giving the Commissioner more options to make your online CFM run a lot smoother than year's past. It's still not perfect by any means but it does show promise for future Madden games.<br /><br />Online Head to Head: If you enjoy playing your friends, family or just looking to for a game to play, this is the mode for you. See how you stack up against some of the best Madden players in the world by going online.<br /><br />Ultimate Team Mode: Build your NFL Dream Team in this mode. Long time fans will enjoy yet another Season of MUT in Madden NFL 16. I know a lot of guys will spend a lot of time and effort in creating their Ultimate Team. The more wins you get, the more coins you can earn in order to strengthen your squad.<br /><br />Practice Mode: Need some extra time with your team to learn harness your Madden skills, then practice mode is for you. Learn your team's playbook backwards and forwards by spending time going over your go to plays. It's time well spent if you are a serious Madden gamer.<br /><br />Super Bowl 50: It's the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Arizona Cardinals in this fictional Super Bowl 50 matchup. You can replay this opening of Madden NFL 16 as many times as you want. It's a great way to get a taste of the game.<br /><br />In closing,Madden NFL 16 is just a flat out fun game to play for anyone who has enjoyed previous versions of the Madden series. It's not without is faults however, but has more than enough good traits to keep you coming back for more. This is the game Madden fans have been waiting for. I, for one, am glad Madden Season is finally upon us!	2015-08-25

Plenty of stealth, deliberation, strategy, and reward for being careful and thoughtful about how you proceed.  Deployables can be retrieved (a great jump forward from SE2).  The North African setting is compelling, and particular care is taken to reproduce vehicles and equipment with excellent attention to detail.  It has the &#34;kill cam,&#34; for the bloodthirsty amongst us, and there's nothing like arcing a 500 meter shot right into the forehead of your objective.  Have played through multiple times, and it remains extremely enjoyable.  While it can be played as a twitch fest (just fire off an unmasked shot and then tackle the enemies that come running), it's vastly more rewarding to sneak through the levels, taking stealth kills, masked shots, and laying traps.  Tremendous fun.	2015-08-25

US	42046550	R2QFEXT342Q7NI	B00DD0B1R0	133719546	Super Smash Brothers	Video Games	4	1	1	N	N	Just as good as the Wii U version	First off, the roster. It has over 50 characters, including Mario, Link, Pikachu, Kirby, Samus, Sonic, Donkey Kong, Mega Man, and even Pac-Man. Of course I'm not going to list everyone but those are some of the most recognizable ones. By far the biggest and best roster in the entire series. Everyone that should be there is.<br /><br />Next one's pretty important, the physics. It's absolutely nowhere near the fast paced, aggressive style of Melee. There's hitstun, but only a little bit, meaning that you'll only be able to truly combo at low percents since they'll be hit closer to you. Everybody still floats like a piece of paper, and you have unlimited air dodges. Shields are nearly indestructible and regenerate very quickly, and you can shieldgrab pretty much everything. So defensive gameplay is the norm, which I real hate but eh. You just have to adjust and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Online: It's terrible. Unless of course everyone you play has good Internet. You can set up a room for your friends, send and view replays or play one of the 2 main modes: For Fun and For Glory. For Fun is a lagfest where you play will all items on for 2 minutes. Most people just go there to do &#34;taunt parties&#34; where they just mess around and not attack each other. You can try to crash the party but you'll just get ganged up on. For Glory is a 1v1, 2 stock battle which is still a little bit laggy but not unbearable. I much prefer this on the 3DS version since the 3DS doesn't use tags, which Wii U people can use to swear at you after you beat them. The worst they can do on the 3DS version is furiously flash their name by choosing a character over and over.<br /><br />Game modes: Way better than the Wii U version because 2 words: Smash. Tour. Smash Tour is an absolute blast. You fight a bunch of different enemies while collecting stat boosts across a huge map. At the end you'll either do some sort of Smash match, have a race, or climb a tower to decide the winner. I seriously consider this a reason to get this over the Wii U version since all it has is some slow boring board game called Trash Tour. Other modes are Home Run contest, where you try to hit a sandbag as far as possible (Pst, use Ganonorf and use his reverse B instead of the bat) and Target Blast, which is pretty much launching a bomb bird from Angry Birds. You have to hit a bomb to break wooden obstacles for the best score.<br /><br />As usual there's Classic Mode and All Star like all Smash games. This time in classic mode, you set the difficulty on a scale of 0.0 to 9.0, much like Kid Icarus Uprising (Sakurai bias lel) and each round you have to choose one of three paths.<br /><br />And now there's DLC. It's kinda overpriced in my opinion ($2 per stage, $5 per character) but LUCAS IS BACK so I doesn't freaking matter.<br /><br />Amiibos are basically just a CPU you can train yourself. It'll also give you cool stuff, like gear and trophies. You can go get a Mario amiibo at WalMart for about $12. Don't worry there's a billion of 'em. If you want any other character you can get them from those lovely scalpers for around 60-70 bucks.<br /><br />This game also introduces custom moves, which lets you change a character's B move (Ex: Changing Mario's Fireball to Fast Fireball) and give them equipment, which you can use to make them faster, stronger, or more defensive.<br /><br />You can save pictures by pausing the game and pressing L/R. All of your pictures are saved to the album AND 3DS Camera. You can attach that picture to make a Miiverse post (Don't expect anyone to notice it since the Snapshot Community is dead)<br /><br />And of course, it's portable. Smash anywhere. It's awesome. Biggest thing this one has over the Wii U version besides Smash Run.<br /><br />tl;dr its cool buy itider this a reason to get this over the Wii U version since all it has is some slow boring board game called Trash Tour.

Ok, after reading other reviews from others who purchased these, here are the points they were right on:  1)The plastic isn't as clear as it could be 2)They are stackable 3)Bulkier Amiibo do fit well.  I also agree with the poster who said &#34;There should be a flat rate for a case of them.&#34;<br /><br />Now as for my opinions/experiences:  1)They are a very sturdy made product 2)They can be scanned on your Wii U pad and your 3DS with the Amiibo pad option.  The down side is they don't always read so well because the case bases are big and a little unhandy which leads to my next point 3)While the case measurements are nice they take up more space than you might expect.  If you only a casual collector that just has a few Amiibo these are great.  They are also great for the serious collector(like myself) keep in mind the space they take up.  I do love being able to display them and can still use them for playing games.  I would give this 4 and a half stars if this rating system could.<br /><br />Update:  I have ordered a few more of these and the plastic is clearer than the first batch.  Maybe Hori got the memo from the one who brought up that complaint.  Also these cases will not hold the amiibo/skylanders, Hammer Slam Bowser and Turbo Charge Donkey Kong and while it will house Yarn Yoshi they will not stay in place.<br /><br />Update:  I heard that these cases are going to be discontinued.  I managed to get many of them from GameStop because they are marked down half price.  I bought all the ones within a hundred mile radius of me.  They are shipped to my main store.  With the huge amount of Amiibo from May to July for a total of 15 this year I figured this product would be in more demand than ever.<br />If you are looking for these try the GameStop stores near your area too.  They should ship any and all from a hundred mile radius to the main store you haunt.  Good luck.	2015-08-25

I really wish I pre-ordered this game because it was a hard time to find the actual game at a store. I went through a Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and then finally ended at another GameStop where they had only three copies left in stock (I had to call ahead to reserve one).<br /><br />Anyways, when I finally got home and popped the disc into my PS4, I was already getting anxious whenever I stumbled upon the main menu. The music of the game was already immersing me into the eerie state of the story, I had goosebumps of an incoming fear.<br /><br />I haven't completed the game yet but after playing through about an hour of it, I'm already amazed. I think the last time I jumped so much was when I played P.T. for the first (Silent Hills Playable Teaser). There was one scene where my wireless headset almost broke because I literally flew out of my chair in fear and my headset went flying off my head (thankfully my soft carpet broke its fall), but make sure you bring extra pairs of underwear before hitting &#34;New Game&#34; on the main menu.<br /><br />A feature I really like about the game is how you can see how a character's relationship with another character changes as you make decisions along the story that effect that character.<br /><br />In the final verdict, I recommend this game to anyone who loves the horror genre in general. Someone who loves getting scared by endless jump-scares, following along the personalities of a variety of characters, and being immersed into a story that makes you think and sit at the edge of your chair. P.S. Seriously, at least consider my underwear advise.	2015-08-25

Until dawn is its own kind of game sure at first glace it my seem like a typical horror game but that is far from the case until dawn is amazing with a beautiful style of gameplay gorgeous graphics, amazing characters (Ashley being my favorite) it brings amazing life to the horror genre that has gone stale and old over the years that being Teen slasher flims it plays great homage to that genre and with so many many choices to choose from in the game this game has great replay value. Until dawn is a game that should definitely not be missed for Amy horror fans or ps4 owners	2015-08-25

It's worth the $60 even if you still enjoy madden 15. The tackling is improved. The new mini games are fun. The graphics have been improved. The physics have been tweaked. The computer ai is improved. The stadium crowd and sound effects are improved. The graphics look a lil better. Nothing huge just the small stuff that people that notice small details will enjoy.

EA is pushing its developers to churn out content while ignoring identified issues in the software.<br /><br />Since March (which may be the release date), there have been reports of the bakery/retail issues being acknowledged by EA but remaining unfixed.  This has significantly impacted gameplay.<br /><br />The two that I've experienced so far (in August) are:<br /><br />1)  Employees are not checking out customers.<br /><br />2)  Customers will not buy from the warming case or lice freezer case.<br /><br />The impacts are that you need to either work harder or pull someone from your home to help with the shop and two, more significantly, is that you can't keep customers in the store to eat their goods and spend more time.<br /><br />A traditional display case is used which keeps it preserved long enough to sell most of the time or traditional tables.<br /><br />With Sims 3 and 2, significant game playing bugs were corrected within a month or two.. or three.. but we're almost at 6 months and major bugs aren't being addressed while content is being parsed out for maximum $$ as quickly as possible.<br /><br />This change in direction is sad and it's significantly impacting the quality.	2015-08-25

Well, while Madden 16 isn't broken, its certainly not great. Graphics and presentation are pretty decent, but the recycled commentary gets old after 3 games. The big new gameplay changes are catching modifications (Highlight reel catches, possession catches, running after the catch, etc) and double-tapping a button to lob a pass. Brilliant. Where are the new Connected Franchise features? What about a new revamped &#34;Superstar Mode&#34; similar to the amazing one in the &#34;NBA 2K&#34; series? Absent. Draft Champions is a cool new mode, but not nearly enough to be a groundbreaking difference. If you were underwhelmed by Madden 15, there is NOTHING in '16 that will change that mindset.	2015-08-25

You wont be able to play online or with anyone else, just start up maps and sit there by yourself offline, unless you play in your house on a LAN or over hamachi.  Glu mobil bought the company that runs Battlefront 1&2 (and several other good games) and shut the servers down in 2014.  EA bought the licence, and are making a Starwars Battlefront 3 (without the 3 in the name) but they are known for shutting down servers also.  I used to host games online for this game, it was awesome.<br /><br />Only 16v16 players unlike battlefieds 64v64, but the maps were too small for more players.  The flying in battlefront2 was better on some maps then the first game by far.  The land vehicles are mostly very well done, almost perfect except for one tank on the clonewars maps.<br /><br /> I wonder if EA could help the community make a patch to fix its online server browser.  These servers are very very very cheap to run once set up, there is no reason for a company to ever shut one down, with virtual machines it dosnt even need to be a separate computer, for 15k they could build a computer to run almost every EA game from 1996-2009 online servers (since alot fewer players play them then they used to).<br />Their bandwidth would be as small as the amount of people wanting to play these games online still are in the hundreds not hundreds of thousands anymore.  Guildwars 1 by NCsoft will be running as long as a single person is playing and it runs on the spare bandwidth of GW2 on a old server in a closet.	2015-08-25

This is a horde control game, like the Dynasty Warriors series, with the Neptunia games as a base. That's about it. There isn't much story, but the character interactions are good. The game isn't hard, but it's fun to play. The main complaint is the dress break system, but if you avoid getting hit at all, you can go the whole game without experiencing it once, since you can get unbreakable clothes after a few rounds with a character. If you're on the fence, wait until Ultraviolence Dimension: Neptune + Blanc vs. Zombie Corp. comes out, which will be an improved version of this. If you want it, get it now, because the Japanese release for the above is still unscheduled, let alone an American one.	2015-08-25

I've noted that some of the simple plastic stands have tabs that seem to make the console more stable on its base that insert into the groove along the side of the PS4 - it's fairly stable; however, I feel that these tabs would make it even more so....Additionally, one of the rubber pads underneath the thing magically came off.  I'm blaming the gnomes....Not sure what the story was there - And the other one has to do with after having it for a couple of months, the fans would occasionally start making the most horrendous noise like they were in pain (if machines were capable of screaming obviously).  I would then turn it on and off again to make it stop.  Sometimes that would work...sometimes not so much....in that case, you would have to sort of thump it a few times....finally it would start working again just fine...	2015-08-25

It's my fault for not reading more into what you get with this product, but I'm still very disappointed and feel duped. All you get with this is Gears of War 1 remastered. It's a $40 game that you can get for $4 on the Xbox 360. No Gears of War 2, 3, Judgment, Horde mode, Beast mode, anything. I would've been happy if they just put Horde mode in it, but nope, all you can do with other players is Co-op campaign with one other person or deathmatch online.  As for the remaster, the only difference between the Xbox One and Xbox 360 versions, it's basically just upscaled to 1080p. It's not like the Halo collection where they redid the entire first game into a modern one. You get the same textures, same look, made without the grainy lines of 480p. Is that really worth $40?  I wish I could take this back for a refund so I can buy ten Xbox 360 games instead, but I doubt that's an option since I've already opened it. I'm a sucker.	2015-08-25

I haven't been hooked on a game in years, nor do I like zombie games, but this is an amazing game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) there aren't many jump scares. This game uses fantastic music and ambience to make you feel intense moments. Sneaking around at night and being caugh in a chase really feel amazing.<br />2) The graphics are great. Even for low end systems it seems they run decent enough to fully enjoy the game.<br />3) The story contains characters you will like as the grow.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The mouths of the characters talking sucks.<br />2) Lots of fetch quests. However, this isn't a huge con, as you will find out the running in this game is one of the best parts. It's not like a boring drive in GTA it's always enjoyable to find routes and gaps to jump.<br /><br />Don't buy this for young children as it is violent. Do buy this if you like good games and want one that really shines above the rest.	2015-08-25

I bought Morrowind way back when it first came out in 2002 at the age of 10 with some birthday money and never looked at video games the same again. I've recently purchased another copy for the Xbox out of nostalgia and the game still holds up. You boot up the game, create and name your avatar, and finish a short tutorial to get you familiar with the games mechanics... and then you're set loose it an absolutely huge game world with basically no direction besides meeting a contact. You can do the main storyline if you want, or none of it. You can do any number of guild missions for mages, fighters, thieves, assassins, the army, or religious groups. There are a number of quests unrelated to any factions as well. All of these quests you can either take up or completely ignore. You can become a vampire (or a werewolf with Bloodmoon), and reap all the pros and cons of each transformation. Even better, the GOTY edition comes with 2 massive expansion packs, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, each with their own quests, dungeons, weapons, armor, characters, and treasure to plunder. Playing on PC will allow you access to mods, which can completely change your game. This game barely needs it though, it is a masterfully crafted world with loads to do and locales to get lost in. Hours of enjoyment abound for whoever picks up this gem, can't recommend enough to RPG fans.	2015-08-25

I felt like Madden 15 was really on the right track with a story line about Eli Manning falling in love with a patch of dirt, and madden 14 about Tom Brady trying to destroy to murder a shovel who stole his wife.<br /><br />Madden 16 however, takes the story up a notch by containing a storyline that contains Jerry Rice coming out of retirement to save the earth from Rex Ryan, who decided to make a deal with the living plants of South Africa on there ever ending journey to try and capture every creator of game of thrones to try and figure out just what on earth is going to happen to spoiler snow in season 6.<br /><br />Also at one point you must take back your land from a bunch of Lions who have door handles as arms.<br /><br />Anyway the graphics are absolutely awful 0/6 stars I hope you enjoyed my review.	2015-08-25

Hyperdevotion is by far the worst Neptunia game I've played. The only way I can properly express my displeasure is with a list.<br /><br />The Leading Ladies: Noire is the main focus this time, which was immediately a red flag since Noire is third best goddess in most games, but the worst in this because it's Ultradimension Noire, which adds an extra layer of pretentious brat on top of the already bland tsundere (shy girl for the uninformed) character. The other goddesses are far more interesting, with my favorites, Blanc and Neptune, saving every scene they're in. They added a male character, but I didn't even remember him until I glazed over another review. I shouldn't even mention him, considering the plot barely changes without him. No candidates though. Take that as you want, but I see it as a negative.<br /><br />The Supporting Makers: As is usual for the series, the supporting cast is made up of representatives for large gaming companies, stand-outs this time being Final Fantasy and Street Fighter characters. What also stands out is the abhorrent amount of sexual harassment Noire endures. More than half the introduction cut scenes for the characters are her being groped, pinned down, or otherwise molested. The only time I liked this was when she was drugged and about to be turned into a mecha, but that scene would have worked better with her clothes on. And those introductory cut scenes? Those are the only characterization you get for them. Some have cut scenes when you fight them before recruitment, but it's little more than showing the characters visual novel picture. They are all unique in combat, but they needed more character moments to flesh them out.<br /><br />The Gameplay: Weak characters aside, it can work if the gameplay is fun, right? Yes, it can and for a while it did. Then I started noticing how broken the game is. You have a limited height you can fall without taking damage. Enemies do not. You cannot attack over a ledge unless you use magic. Enemies can. You only stay in HDD for 3 rounds. The enemies stay that way all match. You can only use finishers when you have built up your lily gauge. Enemies spam them every turn without any action that would allude to them even having a lily gauge. With how often you fight future or past party members, it's almost impossible not to notice how unfair the game is, letting enemies break rules that you have to follow. It kills the strategy and forced me at one point to continually quit and select make easier until the finishers did no damage to me, but that I'm saving for the spoiler story section. I enjoyed the gameplay otherwise, with one specific section near the end making you carefully choose what units to use, how and when. Too bad the section before it ruined the experience for it.<br /><br />The Story of kinda Spoilers: It's Neptunia one. Arfoire tricks Noire out of her power, she has to go around building a party and they fight Airfore at the end. It isn't that simple when annalyzing plot points, but if you look at it as a whole, it's basically a less in-depth version of the original Neptunia plot with Noire as the lead.<br /><br />Now the Major Spoilers to do With Gameplay: Remember how I said the game was unfair? How enemies could just spam finishers? Well here's the kicker. The game sets you up to either need to grind or exploit the make easier function. Let me explain. In chapter 5ish, Blanc, Vert and Neptune go off to defend their home countries. As you'd expect, things go bad. Vert is mind controlled, Blanc is a zombie and Neptune is patriotic... Yes, it really is as silly as it sounds, but this was a fun mixing up of the gameplay to make things interesting, even though it is when I started to notice how unfair the game was, since Vert is usually useless, but is a god when she can ignore the rules. Then the next chapter is when this game last it's second star. Everyone turns on Noire for basically no reason, so the three remaining goddesses have to saveher. The problem, aside from the AI breaking the rules? All three goddesses went the whole last chapter without getting ANY EXP! This was the point where I lost it, because you don't get to back out and recover your party to grind. You either had to grind levels with only three characters or exploit the restart screen to make the game easier. This was some grade F level game design that I'm surprised more people didn't get angry about. This was the last straw and I just dropped the difficulty to clown shoes until I was able to beat every other party member with only three characters. It's a shame, because right after that is a great segment where you have to carefully divide up your party into four groups, being careful not to leave one group weak on magic, movement or melee. It was an inspired set of levels ruined by the fact I was still pissed about the horrible game design one chapter earlier. The last boss was also OP and I did the same thing because I just wanted to be done.<br /><br />In Short: Don't bother. Get Fire Emblem: Awakening if you like RTS and get any other Neptunia game unless you love Noire and don't mind her being constantly molested. I was close to giving this a two star, since it does have a really good section near the end, but poor story, little characterization and unfair gameplay makes this a game I would rather just forget. I would give it a 3 out of ten, but that isn't an option.	2015-08-25

This device was intended to play your console games in any tv of you house (streaming over your local network from the PS4 to the PSTV) without carrying your PS4 around your home, which is nice, but the problem is that the stream quality is not good.<br />The another issue is that the PSTV is compatible with selected PSVita and PSone Classic games, but the catalog is small compared with all the PSVita and PSone games that exist.<br />So, you basically have a downgraded version of a PSVita with a poor streaming connection to your PS4.

Have you ever watched a campy horror movie like Friday the 13 and yelled at your tv because of stupid choices the people make...if so until dawn is perfect. Instead of tellin at the tv you will be yelling at yourself. First off let me start by saying the opening scene is straight up awesome it sets the tone for the whole game. The graphics are what truly stands out as it are probably the best out there on ps4 right now. Gameplay is like heavy rain sort of... So if you're thinking you're in control the whole time you're not. It's very cinematic that's why it's an interactive game. The characters are likable and some dis likable and you can improve or decreases stats like humor, honesty, relationship, trust, and stuff like that. It will help shape out the character or characters fate. The game also has great variety in horror, nearly every element in the horror genre is in this game and there are some plot twists that completely changed the game even though it was predictable overall This is a great game one worthy of getting...just maybe wait for it to drop in price.	2015-08-25

The Madden 16 Dev Team has done an outstanding job capturing the little things as well as the big things, and that what's made this game one of the best in Madden history.<br />Does that mean this game is perfect? NO! What it does mean though?... It's awesome!<br /><br />The all new passing mechanics, and WR/DB interactions have elevated this series to the next level. There needs to be some tuning, but the overall feel of these new additions to game play, have made the game come alive like never before.<br /><br />I'm sure by now you've heard the new mode called, Draft Champions. Let me tell you this game mode is straight fire, and worth the time to play. I know Madden Ultimate Team can be expensive, and once you fall behind those guys who have 99 everything it can be very challenging to compete, well all that is solved in Draft Champions. One it's free to play, and you draft your team through a 15 round drafting system, that allows you to play with current stars, and Legends all in one. You can compete vs the cpu, or online head to head verse others like yourself. With this mode you can't just play it once, and it will become addicting very quickly.<br /><br />Connected Franchise has taken some steps in the right direction, and you can already see the vision for this mode for many years to come. CFM has had some changes in scouting, and the way you run your draft board in the offseason, and those changes are great little additions to the game.<br />CFM is on the rise, and I'm really looking forward to what is ahead for this mode.<br /><br />There are some bugs, that needs addressing, but all in all this game has captured the vision of Ghost of Madden past, and is looking very, very bright for the future.<br /><br />*Tip* Stay off the triangle button when playing Defense. If you wantto get beat deep every time go for the pick every throw, and you will look like a chump, play smart football, and you will win your share of games!	2015-08-25

At first I was concerned about how well these would stay on during use and that it would make using the controller uncomfortable to use, but after about 5 minutes of using it, I was already used to the difference. The extra range of motion you get out of the added height on the joysticks let me bump up my look sensitivity by 1 without any setbacks, which in a shooter is extremely helpful.	2015-08-25

The gameplay, graphics, fighting styles, and fatalities are all top notch.  The single player campaign really makes this game stand out.  I do have a few small complaints.  The first being that the character selection is pretty lame.  Sure there are some old favorites in there, but it is missing a lot of the meat that made the other games fun (Like Cyrax, Sektor, and Smoke to name a few).  The second complaint is, your gold Scorpion costume code isn't going to work out of the box.  You are going to have to jump through some hoops with WB to get a new code, but it is doable without too much hassle.	2015-08-25

I have two of the regular NES30 gamepads and they have served me well for over a year.  The only negative is that I couldn't play Android games that require an analog stick (there are many) and there was not enough buttons for Playstation emulated games.  The Pro is just as well made and even seems to handle Bluetooth connections better while adding analog controls and more buttons.  The layout of the controller is just like a Playstation controller complete with L1, L2, R1, R2 and the sticks double as clickable buttons as well.  Having the analog sticks makes compatibility with games go way up.  The sticks are very accurate for their small size.  I was playing Ape Escape with it like a pro as well as some first person shooters.  The buttons feel solid and have a nice click to them and the analog sticks even have little rubber inserts in the tops of them to give a better grip.  The d-pad is also great and feels like an original NES controller.  (Finding any gamepad in this day and age that has a good d-pad is a feat.)  This thing looks amazing and has a cool LED light effect around the edge.  The lights change color and flashing pattern depending on the state of the controller.  It may not be as comfortable to hold as a full size Playstation controller, especially for long gaming sessions. If you want something portable that is high quality and also looks great, then this is what you want.  Pros:  great retro look with a modern twist, solid build, light weight, good dpad and analog sticks, long lasting battery, easy to charge using phone charger, can connect to nearly anything.  Cons:  Small size and close button placement could cause issues with larger hands.	2015-08-25

This game is basically a no frills, &#34;I just want to shoot and blow stuff up&#34; game. The thin story line is basically there to justify and hang the shooting and explosions on, and doesn't require any commitment (ex: The enemy is called The Target.). You'll almost never run out of bullets, which would defeat the point of the game. My biggest complaint I have for this game, however, is the poor sight system. It's responsiveness is rather sluggish and it can make it difficult to aim at what you want to shoot. However, since you'll almost never run out of bullets, it's not too much of a problem since you just shoot everything in front of you, and you get used to it anyway. Overall, I thought it was a fun game that succeeded at what it was intended for despite having a few flaws, namely the sight system. If you answered yes to the title question, I recommend buying this game.	2015-08-25

Turned me into a penny pinching uncle that could do no wrong on the holidays.	I got this as a Christmas present for my nephews years ago and it was probably one of the most wonderful gifts I have given them. This edition of Skylanders was cheap, since this game series comes up with new backwards compatible versions of the game every year or so and this is the first version. To a couple of nephews around 5 years old, it was the best thing EVER. Now they have all the skylander stuff : t-shirts, stuffed animals, lunchboxes, backpacks, posters and, of course, the latest and greatest editions of the game and characters every holiday since then.<br /><br />To explain the craze for Skylanders is kind of difficult. If you are someone who just glaces at the price tag and the cost of each new character not featured in the starter pack it can be a little daunting unless you look more into it. A fully up to date edition of a Skylanders starter pack can be found in the store up to $70 + each and the regular figures that go with can be over $10 each, so it can make most people balk at the price tag at first, but the secret is that if you manage to stay a generation or two behind the prices not only drop considerably but you will still have enough content through the backwards compatible figures to keep kids entertained throughout many a birthday.  The starter pack I bought only cost my about $20 because its an older edition, the starter pack comes with three characters that 2 players can play at the same time ( great if you have two bored kids in the house), all three of those characters take time to level up so every birthday or so they are about bored enough to be thrilled to get a new one on the next gift giving holiday.<br /><br />There are a ridiculous amount of characters so I have been spending about $10 bucks per birthday with very little stress involved because apparently an uncle can do no wrong by just sending in the next Skylander character in the set. It's like collecting cards, playing GIJoes, and playing Pokemon all at once for them, until they grow out of it a new Skylander is always the perfect gift. Made shopping pretty consistent on the holidays.hey grow out of it a new Skylander is always the perfect gift. Made shopping pretty consistent on the holidays.	2015-08-25

Bad jokes aside, Dishonored is one out of the few video games I’ve played that harmonizes stealth with action perfectly. This game allows players to choose how to tackle each level without being linear. Want to be an assassin and silently take down enemies from the shadows? Or how about run in-guns blazing-with a small rat army? There’s always the option to mix it up and do both!<br />  Each level is well thought out and the combat is highly addictive. I also enjoyed the leveling up system with power/skills; There's teleporting (Which is extremely handy), seeing through objects, and slowing down time to name a few. Did I mention that you can summon a small rat army?<br />  Every character felt unique, plus the voice acting was phenomenal. The story is immersive and I was often asked to make hard decisions pertaining to missions. Little did I know that my choices would ultimately affect the stories final confrontation. Come the last cut scenes, I was emotionally touched, but I won’t spoil anything. For story goers, there is plenty of replay ability to be had here. If that’s not enough, then there’s always the fact that there’s more than one difficulty to play on.<br />  Altogether, Dishonored was a blast and I’m glad I picked it up on a whim despite my skepticism. The graphical improvements are a nice touch and prove welcoming on the PS4. From what I can tell it looks a little cleaner than the PS3 version. Not to mention it comes with all the original dlc.	2015-08-25
