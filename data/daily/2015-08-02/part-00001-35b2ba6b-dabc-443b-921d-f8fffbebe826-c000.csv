These shoes from ARCH are very comfortable. They run a little smaller than some of the others I've gotten from ARCH which means for me they are right on the money!

Fit perfectly and are very stylish. You have to wear them a few times to break them in because your feet may get sore at first, but not bad and not for long. I recommend wearing thicker socks for winter because they aren't really built to keep your feet warm, but other than that I have no problem. And last, they are adorable and go great with leggings and skinny jeans :)	2015-08-02

These sandals won't leave any blisters or red marks on your feet even after 12 hours of wearing them. The arch support is very good, my feet don't get tired in these. The only drawback I see is the suede material gets dusty faster than leather, it's harder to clean it. Obviously there is nothing that the manufacturer could have done if I really like these light colored sandals, they'll obviously get dirty eventually. I used the proper suede cleaner on the straps, so it helped to get rid of some dirty spots. Take care of the sandals and they'll take care of your feet.	2015-08-02

Great improvement by adding the rubber toe protection as on my previous ones the toes got very scuffed up and scruffy looking long before the boots wore out. I use these for work every day and the last set was 2 1/2 years old and still going strong. Cheaper boots are a false economy as I was going through a pair a year. I just replaced my old Breeze with these because the scuffed up toes looked bad. Before going with Vasque I had serious plantar fasciitis. Have not had it in years since. Great soles and very comfortable. Took me several tries to find the right size this time. The toe box had always been a little snug with a 11d but this time it took an 11.5 wide to find a fit.	2015-08-02

I hope they make it forever. Buying a new one soon, mine is a bit ragged from constant use, for 5 years. It is still solid, though. You cannot go wrong with this bag.

I use Huberd's shoe grease for deep conditioning 1x/month. I use wonder balsam weekly on my workboots (I work in a foundry).<br /><br />The photograph shows (l-r) Rocky Stockman Lacer (false tongue removed), Chippewa #20067, and LeHigh metguard (my workboots).<br /><br />Boots were brushed with a horsehair brush, cleaned with water and Fiebing's saddlesoap, and buffed with wonder balsam.<br /><br />I highly recommend the balsam. As you can see, it brightens the colour nicely, helps to waterproof the boot and leaves the leather feeling very healthy. It also, as you can see, slightly darkens the leather (however, my boots were already conditioned, so the leather on the lighter boots was even lighter prior to the photograph). However, the sheen and vivid finish on the leather really sets this stuff apart from other polishes. Highly recommend.<br /><br />Note: Do not apply in thick, gloppy layers.

I purchased a Dr. Scholl's foot pad to alleviate the ankle bone pain by lifting the bottom of the foot up.  This helped somewhat, but by doing so it added more pain to the top of the foot where the tassels are.  I have ordered other shoes using the same size and they were very comfortable.	2015-08-02

I purchased these because I wanted to start running on the various trails around town.  I already had the non-trail version of these shoes, so I was confident ordering the same size.  The fit was the same, and the shoes were comfortable and seemed sturdy.  I liked the colors too.  The mesh on the shoes is pretty thin but it keeps them comfortable in the Texas heat.  However, it’s so thin that I can sometimes see the color of my socks through the shoe, which I think is a little odd.<br /><br />I wore these shoes in a 5k race when it had been raining all day previous.  The grips on the bottom of the shoes made my feet feel secure running on the wet and muddy ground, and I always wear these when the weather isn’t great or when I’m going to be walking/jogging on unstable ground.  I’ve had no trouble with blisters, and the shoes were comfortable right out of the box - no break in time needed.

These sunglasses are unisex. My son bought a pair and so did I. They're a bit wide for my small head but they fit him perfectly. The frames are hard plastic, not rubberized, which I prefer but they are comfortable. The lenses look as pictured and were not scratched at all when they arrived. They don't feel or look like super high priced sunglasses but they block out harsh sunlight and they don't distort things like some sunglasses do. I'm not sure how well they are made but they're $10.00 sunglasses. If I get a summer's wear out of them, that's fine with me. I have lots of pairs of sunglasses and like to mix up which I wear depending on my outfit and mood. These are great for sunny, casual days. I wear mine when walking the dog or in the car when the sun is glaring. They do the job and look pretty nice on. As I said, I didn't expect these to be super high quality or to look like a designer brand. They look fine though and so far, have held up well to not so gentle use. They're worth what I paid for them but I wouldn't pay much more. I really do prefer rubberized arms and polarized lenses. Recommended if you just want a pair of mirrored lens sunglasses to kick around in that aren't super high quality but DO block the sun.	2015-08-02

Even on very steep, long descents I didn't find the wind issue to be a serious problem as others have stated. Yes, a bit of air does get in there but not enough to dry out my eyes. No issues for fogging up and performed well in the light rain I got near the top of Mt. Tamalpais. They stay on the nose comfortably and don't slip down, an issue I was having with my old pair of riding glasses. They also look cool. My problem with them is that I'm used to riding glasses that have larger frames. With these I was constantly aware that there are frames on the periphery that block lateral viewing to some extent. Will probably switch to darker lenses and use these as casual sunglasses because of that issue.	2015-08-02

Although this product is accurately described with regard to the dimensions, they are very misleading. Depending on the construction of your eyeglasses they may not fully cover the lenses - they do not on mine. I carefully measured my lenses and found they were very close to the size of this product. However, the construction of my frames and the hing part of this product, caused them to sit very high on the frame, This caused almost a full 1/4 inch, at the bottom of my lenses, to remain uncovered by the product. In addition to a curved piece holding my glasses together, there is a top bar. This bar  running across the top of the frame, prevented the product from sitting low enough to cover that bottom 1/4 inch. My suggestion is to buy a pair of clip on sun glasses in a store, where you can experiment to make sure they will cover your lenses completely.	2015-08-02

The leather is soft and supple and doesn't rub anywhere on my feet.  The size is what I expected.  No arch support but then sandals really don't provide arch support.

The outer sole and insole are finally starting to break apart so I am on the search for my next pair of work shoes. Given that I walk holes in most of my work shoes in six months or less I am tempted to buy these again. The high quality leather is one of the reasons they have lasted a year, I'm sure, but it doesn't make for a very breathable shoe. This is a problem when you spend 40+ hours a week running around sweating in them (I wear them as a waitress in a high volume restaurant). I've never had a problem with foot odor before, but I have to apply Odor Eaters everyday to these shoes. For that reason, and all the squeaking they do for the first month or so, I have been looking elsewhere. I do find them quite comfortable. My feet are wide with a high arch and they are a little tight, though I believe it keeps my feet from swelling and contributes to their comfort. All and all one of the most comfortable, longest lasting work shoes I've ever owned. May end up purchasing them again.	2015-08-02

She's really enjoying the shoes and says the fit is good.  They've held up well so far - she's been using them for about six months now.  She did say one of the screws fell out, but she was able to find a replacement.  She added a little super glue to the replacement screw, and all the other screws as well.  I think they will hold up fine now!  I don't know a whole lot about tap shoes, but I imagine these would be best for the casual tapper.	2015-08-02

I wouldn't call them &#34;super dark&#34; but they are a little bit darker than my last pair (Flying Fisherman Cabo). The lenses are lower quality in my opinion, because of the vertical &#34;banding&#34; or &#34;streaking&#34; you can see in my photo. I do, however, like that they offer more coverage over my eyes than the Cabo's did. Also, these squeeze against my head more than the Cabo's and feel a lot heavier. The shiny frames are prone to fingerprints and smudges.	2015-08-02

I think it will break in.  I have a Jambu 7.5 in a similar style that is a bit too big so I tried the 7. It will probably work but not with socks.  I don't think these are meant to have good arch support. I wear them all day and except for the leather rubbing my feet like the barefoot feeling.	2015-08-02

When I received this bag in March, I was in love. Everything matched the description, the color was great, and it seemed really well made. The only real problem was that the top doesn't naturally drape over as shown.<br /><br />However, within 3 months after purchasing, the lining ripped out, the zipper pull fell off the back pocket, and there's a hole on the front of the purse near the second pocket. I know that I dont frequently rotate my purses, so my &#34;every day purse&#34;  (which I bought this to be) takes a beating so to speak. I thought that this would make the cut for at least 6 months if not closer to a year based on the materials. I am very disappointed in the quality of this purse.	2015-08-02

They shipped from Germany and took over a month to get to me. This didn't bother me because I didn't need them immediately and know I will get many years of use out of them, but something to be aware of when ordering from this company?<br />All in all this hippie child of the 60s is grateful that Birkenstock is still producing wonderful footwear!	2015-08-02

When she purchased the original pair, there was no discomfort and she could wear them immediately and comfortably the entire day without having to break them in.  Her doctor told her these are the best shoes for her.  It's not always easy to find the perfect fit to support her feet.	2015-08-02

They are a bit stiff and the tongue of the boot tilts off to the side when you walk in them but I think after wearing them a few times they should break in nicely.

I've played for years and worn everything from Adidas pro models to Kobe X Elite and well the Zoom Crusaders are up there. It does run a bit narrow, but the comfort and lockdown of these shoes is superb and overall it's a great basketball shoe. I've heard others have issue with ankle support but seriously, you will roll your ankle with any shoe no matter if it's low or high top. The only true way to decrease your chances are to wear top notch ankle braces, and/or strengthen your ankle/legs. I give the Zoom Crusader top ratings...	2015-08-02

I am another long-time (10+ years) user of New Balance shoes who finds that the 510v2 shoe doesn't fit my feet. The toe-box is generally too small, much smaller than other New Balance models that I wear regularly. The size differences seem random. I normally wear a 10.5 wide, which didn't fit me at all.  The 11 x-wide size was wide enough, but so short that my toes curl at the end. So I tried an 11.5 x-wide, which was long enough, but as painfully narrow as a medium width shoe. So if you've found a size that fits you properly in this model, that's great, but don't depend on the size of this shoe to determine a proper fit. I've given up trying to find a size that fits in the 510 model.	2015-08-02

I keep getting them because they are SO COMFORTABLE, and are always available at a great price. The soles are very cushy. And, the straps keep them on your feet without having to &#34;grip&#34; too much. I walk a a few miles to work and back every day, and these are perfect for that. I also had a few foot surgeries a couple years ago, and I swear by these. I was a little worried about the toe strap on this particular pair, though. It's a little stiffer than the regular solid colored models. But after a few wearings it did soften up a bit and I can now walk for miles in them.	2015-08-02

That is very pronounced on the bag in person. But overall, the bag is beautiful!!	2015-08-02

I feel like I can walk around in these all day without them getting uncomfortable. I'll be using them in Europe to walk around in, and I think I have picked a good, durable pair! I will likely spray with waterproofing spray beforehand, in case I am wearing them when it is raining. My wife really likes them too, which always is nice.

They provide great arch support (my arches are very high), After a couple of days of wearing them a couple of hours a day, my foot has improved, the ligaments and tendons do not hurt nearly as much and I could once again move about without hobbling everywhere.  They are great when I work in the garden and need a thick sole and extra support.  I did find the strap to be a bit long and the shoe to be a bit loose...unless I am wearing a thicker sock. Update:  I purchased a half a size smaller and they are perfect.  I started using the shoes for walking and for the first time there was no pain after the first few days.  I definitely recommend them and you cannot beat the price.	2015-08-02

Worst boots I have ever owned.	These are awful boots. I am a mechanic, so I'm not very hard on boots. A pair of cheap boots usually lasts at least one year on me. These did not survive 4 months.<br /><br />When I first received them I swore one was built slightly different than the other. I have had no fitment issues between feet prior to buying these boots. On my right foot the boot presses up against my pinkie toe, and it feels as if my pinkie toe lays on top of the leather instead of the insole. The left foot felt fine at first. They are made in China, so it's not surprising.<br /><br />Now that we are at the 4 month mark, they have completely fallen apart. The soles are completely falling off.

These boots are fantastic they fit me really well and look and feel great. I wish they had a side zip but that's not a major draw back for me.

I'm very happy with the boots.<br /><br />I'm fairly sure I received a previous customers second hand returned pair which were still in a new condition but out of the box had slight though noticeable scratches, crease marks and light visible wear on the top front of the boots consistent with having been worn for a day or two and someone squatting down whilst wearing them which was mildly disappointing because I bought and paid for a brand new pair of boots.

Not a bad boot for 40 bucks. feet stayed dry on long shore hike. good support scrambling over boulders and rocks. they would get 4 stars if not for my only complaint that they are tough to tighten up. it has to be the eyelets, they all seem to have a sharp edge and they really grab the laces. it would be fine if it helped keep the laces tight but its the complete opposite. worn them maybe 3 or 4 times and the laces already snapped.	2015-08-02

The leather is really firm and while it's alright but it could definitely be of better quality.  Additionally, one of the chains snapped literally the first time I tried on the boot. It wasn't under any particular stress, it just fell apart. Looks like one of the links was super loose.  Also, I'm consistently the same size across various brands, but these were definitely snug.  Had the chain not broken, and had the leather been nicer and more supple I would have just sucked it up but I'd definitely size up if I ordered this brand again (The width was fine, it was the length that was an issue. The toe box wasn't crowded yet somehow the heel felt as if it was completely the wrong shape.).  I wish I liked them better because they're absolutely beautiful online and I love the chain detail, but the reality was a definite let down...	2015-08-02

Not great looking, but comfortable, with good arch support.  Velcro straps make it easy to adjust for a good fit.  Seem to run somewhat wide.  I have sort of wide feet and these are a good width for me.  I normally wear a 7.5 in most shoes, but in this sandal a 7 seems to fit perfectly.  These might not work if you have a really narrow foot.  These would make good water sandals as they have a lightweight rubber sole and straps are like neoprene.  According to the instructions, these are supposed to be worn for an initial 2 hour break-in period, adding an hour each time they are worn, before being worn all day. The footbed is flexible, not rigid, which makes these easy to walk in.	2015-08-02

I have had plantar surgery on both feet and only helped about 50%. So I will live with the problem forever. The only shoes I have been able to wear are running tennis shoes with my orthotics.

Only issue I have is that there isn't much in the way of ventilation in the front portion of the shoe, so your toes will get soaked with sweat. Well, at least mine do. But, strangely, even though my toes are gross and wet, my feet are dry and comfortable. Worked much better after poking a few holes in the front of the shoe in the decorative 'holes' to make them actual holes. Worked like a charm.	2015-08-02

In Sestos, I wear an 8N; in other quality brands, an 8.5N.  Please note this applies to Sestos made in Italy.  Like other manufacturers, sometimes they offshore their production - this results in sizing differences, so I look for the ones made in Italy only.	2015-08-02

At first she absolutely loved the purse. I ordered the black version and it had plenty of pockets and she never have one that large before so it was even better. Now I understand with any handbag/purse there will be normal wear and tear from everyday use, but this bag started falling apart less than 90 days of use. The material actually started flaking/pealing and the seams were even coming undone and even the little metal pieces broke off. My mom was never rough with the bag; if she goes shopping it sits in the cart, at work it sits in her locker, and at home its sits in her room. This has never happened to any of my handbags even the cheaper ones that I've purchased at stores like walmart or claires. I would not recommend this purse to anyone looking to use it for more than 30 days. After contacting Amazon they informed me they usually send a replacement for defective products, but the black bag is currently out of stock and they will be issuing me a full refund.	2015-08-02

I wore these shoes 2 times (1st time 2 hours around the house) and the second time I started to hear a small weird sound while walking. The 2 piece springblade sole started coming off the rest of the shoe. You can see in one of my pictures that there is barely any dirt on the sole of the shoe because I barely put them on. The worst part is that I bought these in April but  I did not use them or even take them out of their box until July and now I do not have the option to send them back or get a refund or even contact the seller to inform of this. A  friend of mine told me that it is possible that I got knockoffs instead of original shoes because mine say &#34;Made in China&#34; and other Adidas Springbalde are supposed to be from Vietnam. Original or knockoffs, these shoes are really really bad news. Please avoid these if possible and even the seller to avoid possibly getting cheap imitations.	2015-08-02

I LOVE these shoes, but be warned, they run at least a full size too large. I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I should buy my size or a size down. I decided to go for my size, figuring a full size down would be too small, and thought I could use a thick insole if necessary. WRONG! They were much too big, so I packed them up and sent them right back. Gladly, the return was free and I got my money back right away. I couldn't wait to order the size 6, but they were still a little bit too big, so I popped in my insoles (they are clear so you can still see the french fries inside!) and had my husband make an extra hole in the ankle strap. Now, I can wear them out and walk around with no problems. They are super-cute, sturdy, and are actually pretty comfortable.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sizing. Honestly, I ordered, returned, re-ordered, and received them in less than a week so it wasn't a big deal, but was disappointed that they run so huge.<br /><br />If you're thinking about getting these, they are truly awesome shoes and I definitely recommend them, but be sure to order a size down. You won't be disappointed, but you *will* be tall.  :)	2015-08-02

Not really big of slip on heavy leather shoes, but these have changed my mind.  These are very comfortable to wear, easy to slip on and head out the door.  They are also very comfortable to wear around the house because they kick off real easy when reclined back in my recliner....though they do thump pretty loud when they hit the floor.  The loud thump doesn't really bother me, it's the look I get from my wife when they hit the floor the does get my attention.<br />The leather is a nice thick grade material, stitching appears to be the quality of what you would expect from Dr Marten.  Not sure the sole will last as long as the original DM shoes did, but they sure look like they have many years of service to offer.<br />And of course since DM does not offer 1/2 size shoes or boots you have to round up to the nearest full size and adjust then with sock thickness.  However this also offers just a little more width for those with a little wider foot.	2015-08-02

I bought 1/2 size larger as suggested by previous posts, in anticipation of a trip to the Galapagos Islands.

They are marvelously comfortable and supportive, and I miss them when I take them off and walk in bare feet (my preferred way of walking.) I also bought the Keen Whisper sandal 1/2 size larger than usual and they didn't fit my foot as well as the Newport. I'm confident that my feet will be protected during our water landings and lava hikes.  My husband also got Newport and is similarly pleased.	2015-08-02

But I hate them so much because they are way too easy for my 19 month old son to take off- drives me nuts. I am constantly putting them back on! The velcro is just on the side of the shoe, it does not stretch over the tongue so there's not much strength holding these onto their feet. They have come undone while he is running a few times and with an already clumsy 1 year old, I am not happy with that.	2015-08-02

Got a few rounds in this summer with these and initial impressions are very good.  Did I mention I walk...?<br /><br />I'm a fairly large fella and felt plenty comfortable after walking 18 in these. My feet felt supported and comfortable during and after the round. I dont think I could ever go back to traditional golf shoes.<br /><br />If you play multiple rounds a week you may need a lace-up shoe but for casual and weekend golfers, I'd recommend giving these a shot. I love them and have made these my go-to shoe.<br /><br />Stability is good which surprised me for a slip-on. I expected a lot of slip and slide during my swing (I avg around 100mph swing).  That's a decent amount of torgue held firmly and confidently in place.<br /><br />It's more important to get the right size for a slip-on to ensure the best stability, obviously. I typically wear 11.5 in Adidas and got these in 11 and that worked great for me.<br /><br />Bottom line... Very comfortable and perfect for my style and weekend rounds.<br /><br />Keep'em tween the trees!	2015-08-02

These boots would be good if you have slim calves I'm assuming. This boot would dig into my calves and would suffocate my calves so much that I would have to take them partially off even during class! I could barely walk approximately half a mile to my car after class -- ~3 hours of wearing these boots.I wore them twice and I'm probably never wearing them again. The things I like about them is the finish and the quality of the boot, but the comfort and the sizing of the boot is awful. I disliked these so much that I went out to buy a different pair of rain boots that were 1) WAY more comfortable 2) cheaper - $20! Another thing to note is that I ordered the matte and they sent me the shiny black boots. I did however receive the difference from Amazon customer support.	2015-08-02

They are, by far, the most cushioned long-distance shoe I've ever run in. I've run marathons in several other brands, but I like these so much, I've ordered a second pair, as my first pair have reached the end of their operational life. The proprietary foam holds up well.   Issues I have is that you have to be careful how tight to tie them, otherwise the upper will dig into your foot. But the entire upper fits like a thick sock, so you really don't have to tie the shoes down tight. They also lack the toe box that most running companies use now. So if you have wide feet, these will be very tight around the forefoot.   The thin rubber sole is also a problem. The nubs wear down after only a hundred miles, and then the shoes become very slick in wet conditions. I do hope Adidas revises these soles, but it's too late in my training to switch to another shoe, so I've ordered another pair of ultra boost. I can't see the soles lasting 300 miles safely.    they also seem to run small. I generally wear size 13 running shoes (size 12 daily wear), but with Adidas, I always need to order 14s. So be aware of that when buying. But Adidas has a great return/exchange policy, so if you buy too small, there is a &#34;no questions asked&#34; return.	2015-08-02

Shoes were well made and attractive in appearance. However did not fit comfortably.

The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn for walking. The first pair only lasted a couple of hundred miles, that was to be expected because they are so comfortable, and comfort sometimes means the soles and heels are soft and wear out quicker. But they, the left one, squeaked. It sounded like little ducklings following me down the street. I ordered a second pair when the first pair wore out and it too (the left one) squeaks, or a better word would be pops when I push off. I'm returning them and will try out a third pair. If these make noise as well I will wear them until they wear out and look for another brand for my next pair. Which is a shame since they are very, very comfortable. But the popping is very, very irritating.	2015-08-02

The shoes are very comfortable and provide light arch support.

I purchased the shoes in three colors (red, black & tan/ brown - see photos), and all three are wide.  I have a narrow foot, so the shoes straps look  funny on my feet.<br /><br />Overall, I rated the shoes as a 4, because its hard for me to find a comfortable and Stylish shoe with arch support in size 11 for women.  I kept the shoes for their comfort.	2015-08-02

Usually within 15 mins of waking, it starts aching and goes downhill from there.  I have a morning routine of stretches and exercises just to get my back in shape for the day.  She told me to put these shoes on first thing and it has made a big difference.  So far, wearing these shoes seems to be the only morning routine I need.  I ordered 3 other pairs so I don't look like Grandpa in my plaid shorts and black dress shoes out walking the dog, but I have to say, if my back feels good, I really don't care what it looks like.  The good news is that these are attractive shoes and it seems that the more I walk, the better my back.  Usually, the opposite is true.  I wear a 7.5M and the shoe fits comfortably.  There's enough room that if I wanted to wear a regular sock in the winter, there's room.  I am so thankful to have found these shoes.  Anyone who has back pain knows how it can really get in the way of life.  Very thankful for these shoes.	2015-08-02

These looked cute but the space from sole to top is high meaning if you have a thick foot and high arch it would fit better. My feet are rather narrow and I don't have a high arch so the flip flops slide around....not good for a wedge with lift unless you want a twisted ankle.	2015-08-02

For this particular model I would go with the dark green lenses	I ordered these in size 62mm in both Gunmetal/Dark green lenses and Gunmetal/Tortoise/Gradient brown lenses to choose the one that looks best. (Thanks Amazon for an amazing and free return policy!)  First of all, these sunglasses are very stylish and in my opinion they look better than the standard RB3025 aviator. Also, size 62mm is perfect for people with large faces like me.  At first I liked the brown color better because it goes well with my skin color, looks more natural and not as harsh as the green lenses which are almost black. Also, on this particular model the gradient brown lenses are dark which is good. (note that I purchased the gunmetal frame. Another reviewer mentioned that the brown lenses with the arista gold color wasn't dark enough)  However, when I tried both of them this morning under a sunny 85 degree NYC sky, I noticed that the brown lenses are kinda reddish when exposed to the sun and I found it to be a little weird. The the dark green lenses, on the other hand, kept their original color and offered a little more so I opted to keep the dark green and return the brown one even though brown/tortoise seem to be my favorite sunglasses color.  I hope it helps!	2015-08-02

One of its best features is the way is designed to hand carry or use the detachable strap to se it as a shoulder bag. I did receive mine free of charge to try it and share my honest opinion. The shape is nice and it is made of synthetic leather, but truly looks like the real deal. Easy to wipe clean and very spacious inside, with a center zippered pocket that divides it inside, plus inside pockets for your phone etc.I love the gray color, just the right shade, I call it my elephant gray purse, it goes with everything. Like the other Avber purses I own, the quality is there, well stitched, no flaws so you can buy with confidence.	2015-08-02

I shouldn't have listened to other reviews which recommended ordering a half size up.  It's not a deal breaker, but they are in fact true to size and I should have just ordered that way.  Other than being slightly too big, these are truly comfortable shoes!  They look a little clunky, but for summer, they are wonderfully supportive and comfortable.  I would only warn away from darker colors as they might emphasize the size more.  I recommend lighter and neutral colors.  Very well made shoe too - withstood a lot of use and abuse (even from my cat who likes to chew my shoes).  Will definitely purchase again, just in my actual size next time!	2015-08-02

I had to add cushion insoles in them, but I do to all my shoes.  I ordered the wide size, and they are exactly what I expected and need.  My only complaint with these shoes, is that the shoelaces are too short.  Laced up to the fast hooks on top, the loops on your knot will only be about 1 inch long.  That makes them come untied too easily.  I replaced them with 54 inch Kevlar reinforced boot laces.  (Heavy Duty Kevlar Reinforced Boot Laces Shoelaces (Black W/natural) 2 Pair Kit (ordered on Amazon)).  These work well, but required me to open up the 4 eye holes on each shoe, with a 5/32 drill bit.  After that modification, they are keepers.	2015-08-02

I've worn eyeglasses ever since I've been in the 6th-grade (1993 to be exact) and every pair I've owned always comes with a free eyecase holder, which most of the time the cases are made from cheap plastic. I was well aware that you could purchase eyecases separately, but I never thought about getting one. Well, that is until I received the Men's Eyecase Holder to test out and review.<br /><br />What can I say about the Men's Eyecase Holder? It's pretty durable with a metal-bodied and a metal hinge. It also features a soft black velvet lining in the inside, so it'll protect your glasses from getting damaged. Along with the eyecase, you also get a cleaning cloth for your glasses. Overall, I do like the Men's Eyecase Holder as it's made from better materials than the previous eyecases I've received when I purchased my glasses.<br /><br />*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary  sample in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.	2015-08-02

I've been using these boots for 3 summers now and they are still very functional.  The heavy rains in Florida flood most of my yard every summer ... got a record 3&#34; of rain yesterday ... and I could not do anything in the yard without these boots.  I keep an old pair of heavy duty clogs in the boots so that I can just slip the boots on and off easily.  My clogs are a women's size 10 wide and fit into the XL boot nice and snug as you don't want to be slipping out of these boots while you are sinking into the rain saturated ground.  There is a heavy sole on the clog and this makes it easy to use a shovel with the boots over the clogs.  No issues w/ the boot tearing.  I recommend wearing socks because the black rubs off on the exposed heel skin.  I wear my socks over my long knit pants and have no trouble getting the boots on and off.  I often sink to the ankle in these boots and my feet stay dry.  The only time I get wet is when some water gets in through a slush through the top of the boot.  Overall, these boots have been great and I highly recommend them for this purpose.	2015-08-02

Authenic Fryes with that rich thick leather and familiar smell that comes along with it. I bought three colors - grey, brown, and dark brown. While all three were beautiful in color, I kept the brown. The dark brown is a very dark brown. More so than what is shown here. The grey is more of an olive. I normally wear an 8 1/2 in boots and these are no exception. They are a bit hard to get into in the heel, but fit nicely once over that - I'm thinking a shoe horn might help, too. I am really hoping that it just loosens up a bit after wear. Overall, great boot!	2015-08-02

The picture is 100% accurate to color. It is not too big and not too small. It looks like maybe an overnight bag but it's not. I can fit my huge wallet inside and even have room for makeup, hairbrush, and even a small can of hair spray. I seriously had my eye on it for weeks and finally I gave in! It's worth every penny. I have a love/hate deal with the shoulder strap but the handles are very comfortable to hold and even fit onto my shoulder so the long strap is rarely needed for me. The problem with the long strap is only that it's so thin and makes me feel like it could slip off too easily. Yet, if you carry very little around with you the strap is no issue! It came very well wrapped and safely secured in a big box. No manufacturer problems, and so far not a lot of wear and tear. I fully recommend this product! Great price and the blue color is to die for. Perfect for every occasion! Five stars doesn't cover how much I LOVE this purse!	2015-08-02

Not great for climbing walls or sandboxes(if your kid doesn't like sand on his feet), but who am I kidding, I bought these because I thought they were cuter than Crocs. They may be a little narrow, but his wide foot fits in with a wiggle. He will wear them all day, although they are easy to take off, so when they get sweaty he removes them.  He wears keens for climbing and splash pads.  I will definitely buy them as his feet grow- so nice to not have stinky shoes that I can rinse off!	2015-08-02

He doesn't mind the wear lines but I do.	2015-08-02

First thing I want to mention is that this is a really well made canvas tote. From the hardware to the stitching, this was constructed to last despite the price being so low. Outside, underneath the large flap, you will find a medium sized, zippered pocket to put things like your car keys and such in. Inside the main zippered portion, you will find plenty of space to tote around your Tablet or Google Chrome. Additionally, there are two nice pockets for your smart phones as well as a zippered pocket for money, credit card and so on. All in all it's not only fashionable but quite practical.<br /><br />One last thing I would like to mention is that it's very gender neutral. In fact, my BF has adjusted the main strap and worn it cross-body (messenger style) and it suits him well.<br /><br />*I received this product from the company in order to review	2015-08-02

Really bummed about these glasses because I thought they'd be a great value for the price, but my &#34;metal reinforced hinges&#34; must have been aluminum or zinc, because one hinge broke the first time I wore them. (Which was en-route to a long hiking trip, so now I have to buy something sturdier at Walgreens...)<br /><br />The lenses do block out a lot of light, however, and the company shipped it quickly.

I walked around the house and it rubbed worse.  The left one fit fine.  The sandals were very comfortable as I have to normally wear orthotics in my shoes.  I decided to send them back and even printed the return label.  I wanted them to fit right because they were so comfortable.  I read the reviews and noticed a lot of people were complaining about the same toes rubbing on the thong part and all said they got used to it after wearing for about 3 or 4 times.  So I decided to wear them just a few times for short walks and sure enough I got used to them and don't even notice where they once rubbed.  I'm glad I read the reviews and kept them.	2015-08-02

The shoe provides solid support in all the right places; too bad it provides support in too many places. Unfortunately the shoe isn't at all comfortable. First of all, I normally wear a size 11 and had to order an 11.5 because my foot was butting up against the front of the toe box when I walked around. When I wear the size 11.5, I notice that the shoe is rubbing my ankles in a problematic way. After 4 hours of standing in these I had to give my inside ankles a break and had to remove the shoes. Now I'm debating on braving the break in period, which I have read takes days, or just giving up on these shoes and settling for an older version.<br /><br />I'll have to remember to update this review after I do a workout in them, because I've discovered many people are saying that this shoe excels specifically for workouts but not much else.<br /><br />In summary, the shoes run about 1/8 inch (half size) shorter and the shoe rim is uncomfortable on the ankles.	2015-08-02

For many years I had to wear business shoes and my feet suffered as most shoes did not fit comfortably.  No more, after I found crocs my feet found relief.  And these rx relief cloud 2 from crocs are superb. Shoes run a bit big,  I wear a 10.5 and I have a wide foot. I purchased a size 10 and they fit perfect.

I do a lot of walking around for my job and the soles of my feet are comfortable all day long.

This is a pretty big amount of shoe polish and can last quite a while. The polish is yellow like and has a oily base, but as expected as most polish. It comes with its own sponge to apply the shoe polish; however, the sponge is a bit fragile and tend to rip. This shoe polish actually work quite well with any leather shoes. I often use it on my Sperry's and other leather shoes. It give its a nice dark finish and protect its leather.	2015-08-02

The Camino de Santiago is an approximate 500 mile hike (790 km.) that starts in the Pyrenees in St. Jean Pied de Port and finishes in Santiago de Compostela Spain. The terrain varies widely from asphalt to boulderish steep mountain paths.  For my 1st Camino in 2012, I had used Keen Zion's that I had tried to buy again, but were discontinued. The Keen's that replaced them were not as reviewed as well so I decided to try something different.  After trying out a pair of Patagonia's that I returned because they didn't feel right after a couple of break-in uses, I came across these Hi-Tec at a local DSW.  I wore them a few times to work and they felt good and broke in nicely.  I decided these were it for Camino 2015.  In the time I used them, the shoes did well despite a couple of normal customary blisters.  They did even better after I improved on the insole, purchasing a much more cushiony insole 141 miles into the hike (228 km.)  After that the shoes felt even better.  I believe I may have gone on without any more blisters after the insole replacement.  Where the shoes became a HUGE disappointment is when I noted at the 211 mile part of the hike (340 kms.) that the shoes were becoming separated from the sole!!!  Needless to say, I was very worried (especially without duct tape!) and I knew that I would have to replace the shoes.  Replacing shoes mid-hike is every trekkers nightmare since they would need to be broken in and the potential for new foot problems becomes greater.  The next big city I was told that would have hiking shoes was Leon at 7 days away!  After 3 days, I arrived in a decent sized town that actually had some time type of selection and I was able to get new shoes.  I bought some type of European brand that I will not talk about since this review is for the Hi-Tec's I specifically bought for this trip.  BUT those shoes made it for the remaining 320 miles plus the extra 50 to get to Finesterre. (530 km total), AND they still look like they could handle another Camino!!  Based on my experience with this brand on my hike, I will never buy any of their products again and will stick to more well-known and respected brands when doing a long hike of any magnitude again. A shoe that is bought for a hike like this should last for at least as long as it was intended.  My 2012 Keen's are still in service.	2015-08-02

Lots of room for my toes and good pivoting on turns. I am old (61) and arthritic so I put my own orthotics in them and my feet feel great at the end of a workout. I have purchased other Ryka shoes and liked them. Actually, I have more workout shoes than I would like to admit, but these are my favorites.	2015-08-02

I got a pair a size too big and wore them anyway for two years for everything from mowing the lawn to moderately difficult mountain wilderness backpacking expeditions and loved them. I decided to try Chacos (in my correct size) and just couldn't do it. They aren't as comfortable and don't shed water as well. So, I bought another pair of these (in my correct size) and I doubt I'll need sandals again for a decade or two. LOVE these sandals!	2015-08-02

They really turn heads. So the good. They are comfortable, they have great grip and definitely supportive. The bad. He is a slashing guard and the extra high ankle is better built for post players. The popular low cut shoes ( Kobe's or Kyrie's ) are excellent for guard play and quick cuts so he is looking at switching these. He wishes he could keep them just for once in a while play but knows they are not an every game shoe. Good luck and enjoy the look	2015-08-02

More of a Japanese mod look. I LOVE that they are vegan and they seem very durable. They have some sizing issues and definitely fall into the 'fashion sneaker' category since the support seems pretty minimal. With the right insert (you can easily take out the original insole) and size, these make great everyday shoes. I ordered a size 8.5 which is my normal size, and they are about 1/2 to 1 full size too big. My sister wears a 9 M and she thought it was 1/2 size too big. So I would consider ordering a full size down, and plan on getting an insert if you like more arch support/cushion. I will order more UU styles because I love their style and mission!	2015-08-02

I stressed a little bit on ordering the new Ascent because of comment in feedback on fitting small. I measure at 11.5 inches at big toe which based on Vibram sizing chart is 45. I decided to order size 46 because of the comment and going with the LR version. I'm glad I did the 45 would have been too tight. The 46 fits perfectly.  I was unsure of the laces, I prefer velcro, however they work fine.  They do feel warmer than my fabric trek sports which I love ( wore the sole out from trail running ). I'll likely get a pair of the standard ascent for summer.  My nirvana shoe would be the trek sport upper with velcro with the new ascent sole - one can only dream.	2015-08-02

There is plenty  of toe space for my hammer toes and bunions and the size 8 fit fine. (I ordered down a size per reviews). Just as other reviewers mentioned,  the heels were very loose ( even  with heel pads).  At first I thought  I  would  have to send  them back but decided to chance it and keep  them. They have pretty  much  conformed to my feet so I  am glad to have kept them. They are super comfortable and provide  good support. I  can't  say I  love the style but they are the product  of hours of searching  for closed toe and heel summer shoes I need for work and accommodate my multiple  foot problems. Overall they were a good purchase  and I'm  pleased.	2015-08-02

Generally, the boots fit well, have excellent traction, and are comfortable. Once they were broken in (word to wise: don't tighten the ankles too much for at least 20 miles or you'll regret it), I headed up to Lake Tahoe to climb Mount Tallac with my son. This is a steep trail with 3500 elevation change that travels about 9.5 miles up and back. It has long sections of scree and tallus. Looking up at one very steep section of scree switchbacks made me feel like I was climbing into Mordor. Really hard on the feet. I did not have the boots tied tight enough early on and this combined with the heat and tough trail gave me some sore toes even though I had plenty of wiggle room initially. Some reviewers have commented on the shoes having a slightly narrow toe box, but this hike made me realize that it's not the last per se, but the fact that the boot leather in the toe box pulls in when tied tight after the boots have been broken in. My toes were more sore on top than the bottom, though I got no blisters. My solution has been to tie a square knot in the laces after the second loop, which releases the tension on the laces below and prevents the toe box walls from being pulled in when tied tight. I'll be hiking the High Sierra Loop out of Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite in September, so I'm crossing my fingers that this lacing technique does the trick. See http://www.backpacker.com/view/photos/skills-photos/beginner-basics-corrective-boot-tying/#bp=0/img3. Otherwise, the boots were very comfortable.<br /><br />I do have small concerns regarding durability, as the toe cap on my left boot developed a small separation from the rubber rand during the Mount Tallus hike. I'll try to glue this back down so it does not get worse. To be fair, I did stub my toe multiple times, so some cosmetic damage would normal. But this separation was disappointing after just one hike regardless of howtough it was.<br /><br />I went for these boots over the well-reviewed St. Elias model because of the better leather and small weight difference, and I'm glad I did. I have a touch of Plantar Fasciitis, so I'm hoping the added stability of these boots, combined with Superfeet Carbon insoles, helps. My foot did fairly well on this brutal hike, but I was feeling it some that night, though not so much the next morning. This said, I'm also experimenting with the trail runner approach.	2015-08-02

As Amazon is all too well aware, I ordered about a dozen pairs of white sandals looking for something that was both super cute and comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours. This pair of Kate Spade platform sandals was my winner. I'm no longer any good at walking in heels, but dealt with the platform just fine. I also put the sandals to an unexpected test when my dinner companion decided we should take a 30 block walk in NYC back to our hotel. This was only the second time I'd worn the sandals (and the first was only for two hours), but I had only one small blister from a strap and that was it. Definitely a winner!	2015-08-02

Most other brands would sit crooked on my face or rub up against my eye lashes and eye browes. Eagle Eyes have made it so that when I wear these glasses, they sit just far enough away that they give me full coverage over my eyes and yet not feel like they are hanging off of my face. I will update the review again when I have a chance to wear them outside and work in them for extensive periods of time. All sunglasses I have purchased in the past have rotted away and snapped. I will make sure to keep this review updated once I diagnose the durability. As for now, comfort and lense quality get 5 stars. They give a very stylish look as well. A case, wiping cloth, and drawstring bag for the glasses is also included with the purchase.	2015-08-02

Have loved some Keen MJs for years, going back to old Chelsea style.  Now rely on elastic strap Sienna's light summer weight in canvas, and it takes a personal orthotic for added comfort; but weak point of style is that non-adjustable strap.  Reisen has a little more structure, and less ventilation, but still light enough to wear in temps below 80s:  well cushioned sole, adjustable strap, takes orthotic (since you can remove one's that come in shoes), roomy toe box and outsole with decent grip.

I have to say that I loved the look of the shoe and feel of the shoe- it has nice soft leather uppers with plenty of room in the toe box without being &#34;clunky&#34;, and I really wanted to keep it.  The shoe fit nicely, even with my orthotics inserted. There were two things caused concern for me: 1. My orthotic made the right shoe squeak with every step. I can't be walking around my classroom with squeaky shoes.... :) 2.I know that these shoes have special technology to give support in the arch- I just didn't feel the support I need, even with my orthotics inserted. I suspect that if I had worn them all day in the classroom  that my feet would have been very unhappy by the end of the day. As a teacher all day support is essential.<br /><br /> If you have issue-free feet I imagine that this would be a wonderfully comfortable shoe. But sadly, I had to return these shoes, thank goodness for free returns!	2015-08-02

They look very elegant and sleek, and also are of good quality by what I can tell thus far. I have not worn them at my wedding yet but am looking forward to it. Now on to the important stuff: sizing. I normally wear between 7.5 and 8.5 depending on the type of shoe. To just average it out, I ordered a size 8. It seems a little bit small (I usually like my heels a tiny bit big because the feet are prone to slide forward) but they are nowhere near unwearable. I would say they are also made for a narrow to average width foot as they fit my feet perfectly in that category. So if you have a wider foot they may not work for you. I would choose the size you normally wear or a size larger to be safe. But again, these shoes are stunning.	2015-08-02

I have to say the insoles these boots ship with were horrible. Hard, ill fitting, and just terrible. I couldn't wear them more than 1 hour. I hit a specialty shoe store nearby, and bought some new insoles that fit my feet better. After that, I started putting the miles on these boots. I hash (walking, with attempts to run), backback, ruck, hike, and camp. They did great. Paired with some ace bandages for ankle support and FITS socks for wicking/warmth, and they were great performers. Point in case: I recently went on a Hash/camping trip with cross country trails, and a float trip at the end of one of these trails. These boots went through creeks and drained really well. I had no problem with traction except for one instance on a mossy climb where my boot slipped. 40 - 50% grades gave me no traction issues, and during the float trip they did wonders giving me traction on the slick river rocks, drained really well when I took breaks on the side of the river, and were supportive during the trail that went through a swamp where I was mucking through knee and thigh deep mud.<br /><br />A little bit about me: I'm 6'2&#34;, 370 lbs, and I have horrible feet issues from being overweight.<br /><br />4/5 due to insoles, and I which they were taller than their advertised 8&#34;	2015-08-02

I figured they would be worth it even if they weren’t the greatest sunglasses I’d ever had.  They arrived in a little drawstring bag inside another ziplock bag.  I’m glad to have the little bag for them since I’m really bad about letting my sunglasses get scratched up. The glasses are cute and comfortable, and fun to wear.  However, they are a little big for my face and slide off if I turn my head to fast or bend over quickly.  I’ve dropped them a few times because I forgot they were on top of my head and they weren’t tight enough to stay in place. To their credit, they are still in good shape considering how many times I’ve dropped them! I’m glad to have these cute glasses, and I’d say they are pretty good quality for the price, but don’t expect something super high-end.	2015-08-02

I ordered an 8.5 since that's what all my other Sperry Top Siders are. These are a bit tight and perhaps a bit narrow, but still comfy. I like that they stay on with the elastic around the top. They are super cute! I'm thinking about ordering another color in a half-size up. :)	2015-08-02

High contrast	Stylish looking and seem to be high quality at first.<br /><br />I'm updating this review because I am extremely skeptical of the UV blocking claims. I wore these for a day of driving nad runnig errands.  At the end of the day my eyes were in physical pain and I was extremely light sensitive.  I believe by (a) dilating your eye, because they're quite dark and (b) allowing UV rays to pass through, these do more damages than no glasses at all.  Your dilated pupil allows more UV to reach your retina and it hurts like a bastard at the end of the day.  I would not recommend these glasses.  I believe the UV coating is not accurate based on my experience.	2015-08-02

These are reminiscent of the jelly style shoes that were so popular in my childhood and seem to be making a comeback. They are simple, flat soled, bright gold sandals that can be worn with dressy or casual clothes.<br />They came with a note attached to the box saying that the gold could possibly come off the sandal, but so far none has.<br />They are a bit narrow and would fit an average medium width foot well,. I have a somewhat wide foot and they aren't quite wide enough but they are too nice so I had to keep them. I have received many complements while wearing the sandals.<br />As for comfort, these are jelly/plastic material so there is not a padded footbed, but I still was able to wear them a long while without any problems.	2015-08-02

There was no breaking in period, they fit me perfectly the first time, and I did buy my correct shoe size. I also love the arch support, I am impressed with how comfortable keens are and how well they hold up to constant daily wear. My first pair I wore every day for two years, excluding Sunday. I still have them and they are still just as comfortable. Three days of every week were spent on my feet working as a CNA. My feet were Seriously never sore. I paired them with compression socks and I never had any feet or leg pain and for those of you who are on your feet all day you know how impressive that is. Try them, you won't be disappointed.	2015-08-02

The one complaint I do have is that this is no small wallet, it is big and when all cards, Driver License, registration, and such are in, the wallet is large. I understand that to protect the pockets and wallet, a lining has to be put in to block the RFID signals, but goodness, has to be a way to make wallet smaller. It is a very nice wallet, just big.

I purchased these boots and made the mistake of throwing my old worn out Carolinas away. I basically had to wear these for a two weeks. I wore them the first week and decided they were not for me because they hurt my feet so bad. They have an odd arch that continues to the outer edge of your foot opposite of the arch. I have to wear then a few more days while my new Carolinas were being shipped.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend these boots to anyone. Redwings should be ashamed of themselves for using their brand name to sell this junk.<br /><br />I have been wearing my new boots for two months and the pain caused by the Irish Setters is still there!	2015-08-02

I purchased size 7 1/2 M in the Light Khaki color.  It's a well-made shoe for light everyday wear.  The fabric is light, crisp with a slight silkiness to it and I think it would wear well and repel dirt somewhat.  I wanted to keep the shoes but they were a bit too long and gap somewhat when I walked.  I don't feel the 7 medium would work after reading the reviews for my particular foot shape. ALso I think the 7 narrow would be too tight across the top of my foot.  I purchased another very similar styleGH's in a light grey tweed fabric and I will be reordering those in 7 medium because they didn't gap and felt softer around the ankle due to the style of padding.  For the right sized foot, these shoes would be excellent.  They are nice shoes for the price.  I wouldn't recommend for athletic use or hard walking on pavement.<br /><br />12-17-15 - I have found the Grasshoppers sneakers to be unsafe for me because the soles are not completely rubber as they state in the online description.  I have slipped and nearly fallen when wearing them.  There are a some very small strips or circles of rubber material, but mostly a hard plasticized material which is totally slippery on tile or other smooth floor surfaces that may have a few drops of moisture on the surface.  Therefore I have reduced the stars from 4 to 2.	2015-08-02

As a daily Merrell wearer for the last 13 years, I was excited to try these lightweight Merrells... They fit good, but there is a big difference between Moabs/Chameleons and these shoes... the best I can describe is that it felt like I was walking on a narrow board, whereas Moabs/Chameleons feel like there is a lot more substance between your feet and the ground.  That's probably how they reduced the weight...  If you're a lean runner, you'd probably like these, however my 300 lb frame is walking and hiking, need a bit more support!	2015-08-02

I'm on my second pair and eyeing a third, I'm never going back to other flip flops again! They have dressier styles too & no one can ever tell I'm wearing orthopedics (which is good because I'm 30), thanks to the two-color design on the sole to camouflage the thickness.<br /><br />These shoes have saved my previously injured ankle & my ability to go for walks! Other sandals without support would make it swell up again & I'd be in so much pain & laid up for days. Since getting these shoes, my ankle never swells & I can walk miles in them!<br /><br />The shoes run a little big - normally I wear an 8.5/9 and in these I wear an 8. They also arrived really tight in the straps in both my pairs that I have - but don't worry they are designed that way. After an hour or two of just walking around the house, the straps stretch to fit my feet perfectly.<br /><br />I convinced my coworker with knee pain after a sports injury knee surgery to try a pair because her knee continued to bother her. Now she won't wear any other sandals - these are as good if not better than sneakers!	2015-08-02

This was ordered as a replacement for another Top-Sider Bahama in my collection that had worn out (and by &#34;worn out&#34;, I actually mean that I spilled on them (at a fabulous party, indeed.) and they were then retired to &#34;working on the lawn&#34; shoes.. ha! Like I &#34;work&#34; on the &#34;lawn&#34;!!! Lol).  I wear Sperry's everyday and own at least a dozen pair in different colors and styles.  I am on my feet for most of the work day (7-8 hours modeling my sexy shoes aboard a yacht along the New England coastline) and they breathe & are the most comfortable shoes (aside from trainers) that I own.  Buy these shoes - they're attractive and will, in turn, make you more attractive and people will like you more because of them.  If you don't buy these shoes - you're an idiot who doesn't want to get laid.	2015-08-02

Mine are yellow with a yellow sole, though the picture makes the bottom look almost light tan (it's not, it's a half shade lighter yellow than the shoe itself). They are what I expected looking through reviews, and I am satisfied with them for my purposes. I did NOT have issues with strong chemical odors as some have reported, though that may be due to others' sensitivities or perhaps a bad pair. There was a faint smell of &#34;newness&#34; like new plastic- likely from the bag it came in- but it went away within an hour. I will need to buy some kind of inserts to support my arches since I'll be doing a fair bit of walking, but I bought these knowing I'd need to make that extra expense. As for fit, I wear a size 11 regular width and purchased the same. They fit just fine out of the package bare footed with enough wiggle room to comfortably wear a pair of socks. If you are between a regular and a wide width, I would say you can fit them but maybe expect a bit of &#34;breaking them in&#34; time. Color wise I would say the picture is a little lighter than the actual shade I received. The color is like a marigold, light sunflower yellow (kind of like the Simpsons' skintone) so if you're looking for a vibrant &#34;true&#34; yellow you might be disappointed, but I was actually pleasantly surprised since that worked for me.	2015-08-02

Between being on my feet at least 8hrs a day and crawling through ceilings the soles and rubber capped toes are holding up well. The leather is fairly soft which is nice for flexibility but cuts/gouges fairly  easily so be aware of that if you deal with sharp stuff. Also, plan on new insoles after @ 6 mos. if you want to maintain the factory comfort. They come with great insoles but the do compact with time.	2015-08-02

So it's been about 3.5 months during a hot North Carolina summer (which means very little sneaker wearing). My daughter wore these to school about 10-15 times, and then during summer break about 5 times. So a total of 15-20 times, and I'm being conservative. She's about as far from a tomboy as possible (I have to make her go outside, and she almost always wears crocs when she does) and the &#34;grass&#34; where she played at school is that high-end artificial grass, so it doesn't get muddy or gross out there. In conditions like these, I'd expect these shoes to look decent after 15-20 wears. I'm not expecting them to look perfect, of course. But they look awful! All chewed up with the color and the sparkles rubbed off in several places. I don't think I can even give these to Goodwill. I've attached a photo so you can judge for yourselves. Keep in mind, this is 15-20 uses TOPS in very mild conditions.	2015-08-02

The back of the heels are a tiny bit big, but with the zipper on the top of the foot my foot didn't slide and I didn't get any blisters. Great shoe!	2015-08-02

These are good boots, but I have a few comments:<br /><br />-These boots come long. I normally buy size 9 for running or hiking boots and 8.5 for heels or flats. I noticed reviews that said these run large, so I ordered a normal 8.5. I should have ordered an 8 wide. There is easily an inch of room or more in front of my toes.<br />-I put gel insoles on top of the original insoles to help take up room in the shoe and to add comfort. Otherwise, you will have to wait a week or two before they will be fully broken in.<br /><br />I would have returned them for a different size if I didn't need them immediately. Now they are too worn and used to be returned. I'll probably sell them and buy the same ones that actually fit (and transfer my gel insoles too).	2015-08-02

I liked that the non-suede version, so I wanted to get one with a different look, but the suede version is somehow not as soft., maybe because it is suede.  I have wide feet, so I have to get 1/2 size bigger in the medium for it to be comfortable or else I would get a 6.5 wide.  I like to sport versions because they have more cushion that the regular keds.  Too bad not as many cute styles and colors though on the sport version like the classic keds.	2015-08-02

Very good boots and I say that as a man who usually only buys Danners, these boots cannot be beaten for the price, they look great and are the most comfortable boots right out of the box i have worn. The only down side ( if there is one) is that they are hard to get on and off by using the zipper only and i have to untie them, not loosein the laces but just untie them. I would definitely buy another pair.	2015-08-02

BEST SANDALS I'VE EVER OWNED!!	I bought these sandals many years ago, when they were branded as Birki, not Papillio, which I guess makes them five years old at least. (Papillio introduced them in 2010 in this color.) It took a few days to get them adjusted satisfactorily that I can recall, but from then on I've never looked back!  The hallmark awesome Birkenstock footbed is there, with it's arch support, toe ridge and so so comfortable suede lining.  The sandals have been on my feet in almost all weather conditions -- well, except ice and snow! I wear them outdoors from March to mid November because they are so comfortable, and indoors all year round.  Now, after hundreds if not thousands of miles of wear, the small strap part of the toe &#34;ring&#34; has started to split on both shoes where it meets the sole right between my toes. And the cork sole is doing the same, precisely where the small toe strap meets the sole. It hasn't yet split the whole way across the sole. The good news here is that the EVA (final) layer of the sole is still intact -- no splits whatsoever. Although the &#34;Birk&#34; impressions which were to be seen here and there on the new soles are now but a memory, there is still plenty of wear left in them, and while the toe strap has stretched a bit and started to split, my Birkis are still perfectly wearable, even after five years! Today I bought another pair (although the Lightness range has long since been discontinued), in anticipation of the forthcoming unhappy day when my toe straps finally complete their split from my soles! To sum up:  I highly recommend these sandals to anyone thinking about buying a pair. You may need a few days to get used to this style, even if you're used to wearing toe post sandals, as I was, and you may even get a few small blisters, but persevere with them. It will be SO worth it!	2015-08-02

I love shoes with good traction and these are perfect. The sole is a very noticeable part of the shoe and makes them a bit more stompy than if they didn't have such deep lugs. I love walking from building to building at work in them, first because they are very comfortable, and second because I don't have to concern myself with where I step. When I take my favorite path across the grass I know the treads will grip in the muddy patches that I find there, so I don't have to step over or around them. When I am in our messy cafeteria I can just let my soles land where they may--on spilled drinks, a dropped breakfast, old french fries--the sharp edges of the treads bite in and grip. Aggressively! The best part is that they leave their marks when I do that. I always leave a mark in the mud, and often track the food I walk on across the cafeteria floor. The day after I got the shoes I walked through a big patch of spilled macaroni and cheese, and it tracked for many steps because a lot of it stuck in the deep crevices of the lugs. My lunchmates joked they found where I was sitting because of the yellow tracks I left across the room!	2015-08-02

Since I've been wearing Vionics Orthaheel products, I've had no more pain.  In fact, my back feels better too.  Amazing.  The sandal fits well; after wearing it several times I did tighten the buckle as it had begun to feel loose.  Because of the slant to the sandal and the thong front, it was a little uncomfortable at first.  But now I can walk long distances in them.  By the way, they recommend that you start out wearing Vionics for 2 hours at a time until you foot becomes accustomed to the arch support.  I would follow that advice.  I went a little too long with my first pair in the beginning, and it became quite uncomfortable.  I only had to do that with the first pair, though.	2015-08-02

I normally wear a 9.5 or 10, so I purchased these in a 10, and they fit well and fairly snug across the top of my foot, but not uncomfortably so.  I was confident that they would not come off my feet while rafting. We had many outdoor activities planned for the week vacation in TN, and boy was I impressed with these shoes and also ended up wearing them ziplining, all day at Dollywood Amusement Park and on 2 hikes to waterfalls in the Smokey Mountain Park.<br /><br />The shoes drain very well once they are submerged in water and are super grippy on the bottom.  Both of our hikes were moderate in difficulty and were on trails that had many small and large rocks, tree roots, streams, and mud.  I also wore them in and out of the rocks and running water near the falls and felt very secure that I would not slip despite some quite steep descents and climbs both on land and in water.  They are not as supportive as regular tennis shoes and I did have a slightly sore lower back after our longer hike and our all day at Dollywood, but as much as put these shoes through, I was thoroughly pleased and would purchase this brand in the future.  I don't normally submit product reviews online, but I was so happy with these shoes, I had to submit this review.	2015-08-02

At first I wasn't sure I was going to like it with the side pockets sticking out like in the picture. Much to my surprise I actually really like this bag, its very big and spacious. When it first came there was a strong odor to it and that worried me, but with as soon as I smelt it, it seemed to fade away. The top closure is very unique, I've never seen one like this before and it, to me, feels more secure then a magnet closure on some other bags I was looking at. Although the magnetic closures on this bag are strong, very good for the price. Seems well made for the price of it too.<br /><br />My one and only Con: the strap adjustments never stay where they are supposed to, now I've never had them completely slip down but throughout the day they will start to go down and then I'm having to adjust them up.	2015-08-02

I bought these for a hybrid walking/jogging shoe and its the Adidas quality we all remember. The build of the the uppers and insoles are great, But  what I am finding is that he soles are lacking. After about a couple of weeks or and around 30+ miles the soles are beginning to degrade. Also I've found them as being much heavier than expected and almost clunky.<br /><br /> I think if you were to wear them just to kick about and for fashion they would suit the purpose, but any serious walking or jogging you'd be disappointed. As for the price I bought them for it was fantastic.<br /><br /> I walk on normal asphalt and streets.	2015-08-02

My very first purchase of Sperry Angelfish shoes was in the leopard sequins print.  I ordered them from a well-known shoe retailer and not having ever owned Sperry's before I went with my regular sizing at a 5.  When they arrived I tried them on to find that they are really quite loose.  They slip a lot on my heel leaving blisters.  This is my fault though since I didn't know how these shoes ran in size.  Since this initial purchase I have a second pair of Sperrys.  This pair I tried on in store for a good fit.  I ended up getting a size 2.5 in kids size.  They were a little snug at first but stretched out to the perfect size and now they are my favorite shoes.  So my best advice would be to try these on in a store or be sure if you are ordering them online that there are free exchanges/returns.	2015-08-02

They are not wide enough by far even at a 4E-6E. They pinch my foot and don't provide room for swelling. I can barely close over my right foot at all. Arch support is totally wrong for someone with a collapsed mid-foot and took out the padding inside since it's &#34;shaped&#34;.<br />If the shoe was wider and I didn't have charcot - I am sure this would be a great shoe for me. But as it stands nothing I can do now. These were delivered the day I was packing up my car and a Uhaul to move to AK - so got tossed in the back and tossed around. when I tried them it was to late to return them. Bummer since they cost $124.00 and I cannot use them.	2015-08-02

I have always loved the 810 and 811. I was a little concerned at first about how light the 812 are compared to the previous 810 / 811. I thought it would be lack of quality. It isn't. I do find the lightness more comfortable. I am a little disappointed with the arch quality. The arch support isn't as good as previous models. I have high arches and need extremely good support. The 812 lack the same support.  I had to say no to the support because there was no choice to say some but not enough. The support is average. I need and expect better.	2015-08-02

I wish the sizing was appropriate on ALL of these shoes and not just on the leather ones. I ended up giving them to my sister who has much smaller feet than me.	2015-08-02

Considering the low price, I find the shoe is great for paring with jeans for an evening of dining out or conversation with friends. I don't hold any expectation that these will be my go-to everyday shoes. These shoes are made in India. The workmanship is passable. The outside leather is soft and they are comfortable; almost like slippers. But, there's little cushioning or support for your aches or the bottom of your feet. I installed a pair of double thickness Dr. Scholl's cushions and that did the trick for me. If you have pes planus (flat feet) or plantar tendinitis you might want to skip these shoes. If you have foot  problems or you need these shoes to stand-up to daily wear and walking activity, you'll likely be disappointed. If you intend to wear them occasionally and only for a few hours at at time, they'll do just fine....especially considering the low  price. By the way, this supplier has nearly doubled the price since I purchased these shoes in July 2015.	2015-08-02

We have gone in the past and not having the right shoes at Disney World can be a disaster.  I am a big woman (270 lbs) and very active so I have to have shoes that will support my ankles and feet.  These shoes were amazing.  We were at the parks all day (17 hours) for 5 days and my feet and legs were fine.  According to my pedometer (calibrated) I averaged around 22,000 steps each day and I had no pain or soreness at all!  Frankly it was amazing.  If someone my size can wear these shoes and be on her feet all day and still be ready for more, they will work for almost anyone.  I should also mention that I usually have problems with my heels and arches; my trainer says it is something about the way my feet hit the ground when I jog or power walk; but I have not experienced that issue since buying these shoes.  (Not sure why; but if it fixes the issue I suppose I do not need an explanation.)	2015-08-02

The depth of color is rich and while it is bronze it works lovely as the shade of brown I was seeking.

I purchased these boots having worn the Converse model for the past five years. First of all the quality control was not what I would have expected from Reebok, which makes me question if these were seconds or rejects that didn't pass Reebok's QC. I could be mistaken, however, I would expect that Reebok would not let these pass their QC process. The fit was larger and they didn't support my feet as the Converse model did. I could wear my Converse all day walking on cement floors without pain. With these boots, my feet started hurting after four hours. I've attached photos of the lack of quality control (foam extending out from stitching).	2015-08-02

Not because they wore out either but because I love them so much that I don't want to be without them.<br />It would cost almost as much as I paid for the boots to have them restored at a shoemaker so I just bought another pair for when that time comes. These boots are perfect (for me) right out of the box, no breaking in required. I wore them daily on a week long trip to Paris where I walked an average of 8 miles a day and they were a dream to walk in.  Not only are they comfortable, they're fashionable too and I love the pointed toe instead of a big clunky round toe. Highly recommended!	2015-08-02

In most of my shoes I replace the OEM with either the Sorbothane UltraSole (w/o arch support) or the Sof Sole Airr Lightweight; so now I am uncomfortable if I don't have that level of cushion (a very &#34;first world&#34; kind of problem). However, both require a significant amount of extra clearance in order to fit right. I tried this &#34;ultra thin&#34; version of the Sof Sole recently in a pair of Patagonia Drifters that need to be pretty snug because they are meant (and used in my case) for hiking. They fit perfectly when swapped for the stock (read: cheap uncomfortable cardboard) insole and feel almost as good as the much thicker Airr or UltraSole. I have pretty low arches and avoid replacement insoles with more than very minimum arch support; so these are exactly what I needed in every respect. I am really impressed and they certainly exceeded my expectations for such a thin insole. One other discovery: if these are still a little too thick for your situation, the even thinner option is the Spenco Rx Comfort. One answer on its page says they are only 3/32&#34; thick. They are also perfectly flat from heel to toe; so there are no bubbles, bumps or arch &#34;golf balls&#34; to make things tight in one particular area. They don't provide the cushion of this amazing &#34;ultra thin&#34; insole, but they help considerably while requiring the absolute minimum amount of clearance to fit. So between those two options I am able to &#34;enhance&#34; every shoe I wear regularly. When you consider how much you pay for quality shoes these days, the extra investment seems reasonable-- and if it encourages you to keep them longer because they are still comfortable, you actually save some money in the long run. So that's my observation and experience with these super thin alternatives to their much thicker big brothers-- exceptional cushioning in tight spaces and easily worth the $15 investment.	2015-08-02

I was hesitant to purchase these because I didn't like the height of the heel and I wanted something easy to slip on and off. These are the most comfortable shoes I have and I can't wait to get home and put them on everyday!<br /><br />With regards to the look, I think they look just like any other loafers when worn with pants. You really can't see the fur or the split near the tongue. That works out perfect for me because I wanted some nice loafers and these fit the bill.<br /><br />Now, the size. I typically wear a size eight. (I think my feet are 25.5cm) I ordered a size nine, because the reviews here said they were a little small. I also checked my size via sorel's website and a nine was probably right.<br /><br />These shoes are the bee's knees and I will be buying a second and probably a third pair within another month!	2015-08-02

This is the most inexpensive chukka boot I have in my closet - purchased to go with a specific suit.  They are comfortable.  I only wear them occasionally, as I usually don't feel like dealing with suede after a long work day..  Fit was expected (I have wide feet, so i knew a D-width was going to be tight-ish. These were just as I thought they'd be) The grey boot is a suede (or faux suede) material - again, they look good on initial purchase, but be prepared to give them proper attention after each wear to attend to any dirt that might have gotten on the suede  I know the attached pic isn't great - tried to show the suede new out of the box as best I could.  Also, there were a few states that weren't properly cut/ had open stitches - I cut the free hanging stitches and ignored the couple misses - no one will see them as the pant cuff covers them.  These were on the low end- price wise - so I didn't expect perfection like on $500+ plus shoe.  Certainly very good for the price, just understand about the care for the suede.	2015-08-02

This shoe is quite heavy for Skechers. The heel slips off while walking and feels more like a clog. Still debating on whether I should return them because although it is not listed as a wide shoe, it definitely fits wide feet and the fact that it fits and is fairly cute for work shoes makes these feel like a win in the work shoe department. But as far as being in them all day long, no. My ankles and my arch are killing me by the end of the day. And it's day two.

The fit is just a bit wider that the shoes from the 80's, but I tied them just a little tighter and they fit great. I'm in So Cal and these shoes were very popular in the day. After reading some of the reviews, I was a little worried. But when the shoes got here I was very happy to see that these are REAL Sperrys, the ones you pay $100 for at a big name retail store. I paid around $40 with tax, and didn't drive to the Mall. Quality looks good, maybe not as good as the 80's; but what is. This color was on sale; if I didn't expect these to last 5+ years I would buy another pair.<br />If I had gone for the &#34;bone&#34; color and paid $94 I would have still been happy with the quality; but getting the same shoe in &#34;Ice&#34; for $40...very, very Happy!	2015-08-02

After joining the Crossfit gym and climbing a few ropes I quickly determined that I needed appropriate shoes for this new sport.  Love the 4mm heal drop and the shoes fit me perfectly.  They are very comfortable for Olympic lifting as well as Metcons.  I have ran up to 2 miles in these shoes and they are adequate for this task as well.<br /><br />These shoes do NOT provide much arch support.  I have a huge arch and have suffered for over a year now with plantar fasciitis.  These shoes are fairly flat which made them a perfect match for my orthotic insoles.  I could NOT wear these out of the box due to the lack of arch support.  No way.  However, once I removed the thin insole and replaced with my own, the shoes are awesome.<br /><br />I also want to add that my wife and my daughter both have a pair of these shoes.  They have normal feet without ginormous arches and they both wear them out of the box and love them as well.	2015-08-02

Very comfortable at first but as I continued wearing them, they began to cause serious foot pain. The same pain in both feet between the third and fourth knuckle joints.

They were so big I had to send them back and got size 9.  These are really too big too and probably should have sent them back but thought I could live with them that way.  They're still too long and too wide - though in all fairness I have a slightly narrow foot.  I got some insoles that have taken up some of the extra room but they're still a bit too big.  I think Skechers have taken the &#34;relaxed fit&#34; thing a bit too far.  You have no real idea about what size the shoes really are.  I would never buy another pair of the relaxed fit shoes unless I could try them on.  They are nice and cushy inside but provide little or no support.  They're fine for very casual wear but certainly not appropriate if you want any support.	2015-08-02

Note I didn't even try to say comfortable, just wearable.  I wore them twice, was utterly miserable all day and at the end of the 2nd day, went home and threw them in the trash.

I bought these to try out, and the are great. They have enough minimal feel that they don't change my foot fall, the sole flexes nicely, ans the upper is light but not so thin that I worry about premature holes. They are comfortable to wear around town, walk in all day, and run several miles. The tongue is thin too, and lays flat against the top of my foot so as not to slide around and bug me mid run. I think I might buy more when these finally wear out.	2015-08-02

I love everything about this shoe except the narrow toe box.  I've run in them on trails and packed dirt (both dry and wet) and they have been great.  I was worried about the lack of ground feel but it has not been an issue.  In the past, cushioned shoes have caused me to twist my ankles on unseen roots and rocks.  With these I've found that the extra cushioning compresses around the roots and rocks, (conforming to them without causing pain on my foot) and have had no twisted ankles.  If Hoka widened the toe box this would the perfect shoe.	2015-08-02

I don't really have the budget to purchase items such as this at the regular price (quite a splurge!, but when they go on sale, I think they are a great deal--gorgeous as well as practical--and last for years with just a modicum of care). I also have a backpack in a rustic tan leather made by the same company that I use during the academic year for books and folders and it has also worked out very well. So, although I can't really say I needed another backpack I had still been keeping an eye on this one and was constantly checking availability and price just in case a great deal popped up on a black one...but before that happened, I received one as a gift!<br />I haven't used it much yet, since I just got it, but so far it is great! It is quite large and holds a lot but is still easy to carry (I also find it simple to position on my back, so I am more likely to use it correctly, rather than just slinging it over one shoulder as I often do with other backpacks) either as a hand-held purse/handbag or as a backpack and the detachable backpack straps make it versatile (remove them and you have a very nice, large tote-sized bag that zippers closed. One feature that some people may not like is the position of the zipper--like the Josie purse, it is located at the front of the bag, and not at the top so this might affect how easy it is to pack very large or bulky items...but I don't carry anything that big so not a problem for me, and I like the way it looks with this configuration. I also like the pocket at the front of the bag--my keys and glasses are easy to get to and it looks buckled but is held by a magnetic snap.	2015-08-02

These shoes do look good. I think they are built keeping in mind light weight and you feel it when you wear them. They feel really tight and when you look at your feet in your shoes, they look smaller then usual because very thin and light material is used to build the shoes.

I like the contrast of the material - leather in the front and elastic stretch material in the back.  It makes the boot different from all of my other black leather boots. It also has a very nice size heel that you can walk in everywhere and looks classy with pants, skirts or dresses.  I thought the elastic, stretch material might look cheap/bad but I was pleasantly surprised that I actually like the look and feel of the material and it works to dress it up with slacks or the casual look with jeans. I cannot wait to wear them this fall and winter!	2015-08-02

It can be awkward carrying both, plus pad and pencil when wandering around at work and going to meetings. So, I looked for something that could hold both comfortably. Additional, like this week, sometimes I am also the 'on-call' person for after hours emergencies and need to carry a third phone with me at all minutes of the day (missing a call is just not allowed).<br /><br />The picture I uploaded shows all the things that I was able to easily fit into this bag: iPhone 5 in Otter box (7cm x 13.6cm x 1.6cm), Samsung Galaxy 6 in Otter box (15.5cm x 8.9cm x 1.7cm), Samsung Galaxy Note III (8.5cm x 15.7cm x 0.7cm), a small note book (8.9cm x 13.9cm x 0.8cm).<br /><br />The Samgung G6 and notepad fit in back pocket, the Samsung GNIII in middle pocket and the iPhone in the front pocket.<br /><br />If the iPhone had been in a smaller case, the front pocket could be closed over it.<br /><br />Without the notepad in the back, both of the Samsung pockets are closable. With the notepad the zippers could be closed, but it put a lot of stress on the seems on the back pocket.<br /><br />I was also able to add an iPod Touch (no case) to the front pocket.<br /><br />With the strap snugged up, this hangs just right under the arm on the side, with easy access to each of the phones.<br /><br />It's early days yet to say how the bag will hold up over time. But, so far, it is exactly what I need. I'll try to remember to update this when I can provide good evaluation (one way or another) of the basic sturdiness.	2015-08-02

I was expecting a struggle getting these on, but they went on easier than I would have thought.  I have somewhat narrow feet and average arch.  The back tab really helps.

I ordered the chocolate and I would expect they would work fine for the office.  They only have an insole on the bottom, but they are very comfortable out of the box, non clunky UGGS and I am looking forward to wearing them in the fall.	2015-08-02

Amazon was amazing at refunding my money. Nike actually has a 2 year warranty on the shoes I found out from a Nike store. I did by another pair, just not from Amazon. We'll see if this pair holds up better, the current style has see through air chambers where as the pair from Amazon has black covering them. That's the only difference I can see.

Absolutely recommend using this glasses for night time safety. Does as it states, cuts out the glare and makes night time driving safer. Also it helps in seeing profile of vehicle, so you are better aware if its a pick up or car, truck etc. What was pleasantly surprising that it came with a microfiber based pouch that also doubles as cleaning cloth. I wear glasses normally and this is a decent size that can be worn over regular prescription glasses.It is prone to scratches, so treat it with care and you should be fine.<br />Bonus: can cut the haze during the day, help you see name boards and signs, traffic lights and vehicles better.

I bought one pair several months ago and just bought another pair. They fit wonderfully. I'm a size 9 normally and these size 9's fit perfectly. I have somewhat wide feet but don't have to order shoes wide, for the most part. I don't wear them with socks and they don't rub anywhere. They're surprisingly soft. I need arch support or my feet ache and these give me just enough support.  The don't slip at the heal and the little laces give it just the perfect fit. The laces wrap all the way around the shoe, so when you pull them tight, you can really feel they fit snug or loosen them if you have wider feet. The fabric is so soft. Just like any pair of shoes you were without socks, the bacteria from your sweaty feet will make your feet and shoes smell. So I've washed them 3 times in my washer with bleach, detergent and oxy-clean. I then let them air dry. Not only do they not stink after that but they fit just the same if not a little better. I bought a white pair the first time and the gold/white pair the second time, so I used regular bleach but you can use color-safe bleach if you bought shoes with color. I love these shoes. I wear them with my work clothes and casual clothes. They go with everything and look so cute. I get compliments on them all the time. I'll be sad when the snow comes and I can't wear them until spring again. :-)	2015-08-02

They slide down when my son puts his foot in the shoe (every. single. time.) and become &#34;ouchie,&#34; folded up under the Velcro. The shoe tongues are so short they are hard to grab and pull back out, and hard to hold onto to get his foot in the shoe, so they are a pain to put on.	2015-08-02

Good price, decent boot. I like the eyelet construction, using washers on the interior side.  They are fairly light compared to some of my other boots, and there's really nothing overtly wrong with them.  But the sole feels like it's going wear down pretty quickly (which does however make them a little more shock absorbent I think) and the shank/midsole portion of the boot is a little weak.  I wouldn't want to be on a round-rung ladder for too many hours with these.<br /><br />The fit is right on size, and there was really no break in discomfort.  Of course they felt better after a few dozen days of wearing them, that's how leather boots work, but they weren't bad straight out of the box.<br /><br />Hooray for oblique toe though!  I wish more manufacturers would make them this shape.	2015-08-02

I wanted something that I could fit everything I could ever want in for all kinds of outings and long trips in the car... I can fit my cloth diapers and wipes, yarn and crochet hooks, school books, crochet book, and leisure novel, snacks for the kids, extra clothes for the kids, water bottles and the little misc. electronics like phone, ipod, camera, tablet, etc... everything is easy to get to because of the compartments, and it's water resistant so everything has stayed dry when I've gotten caught in the rain... the zippers are very smooth and the bag overall is sturdy... it's easy to clean, it looks nice, and I love the little monkey keychain!  I love how deep it is and how the outer pockets come out, unlike other bags where you have pockets that don't actually provide extra space because your items just bulge into the bag... that's not the case with this bag, all of the pockets are actually functional and spacious!  Love everything about it.. a little spendy, but it is so useful and durable that I think it's worth it!	2015-08-02

I was pleasantly surprised. The leather is very soft to the touch and is the color that I was expecting. It has lots of card slots which is why I chose this wallet over other options. There isn't a place for change, which could be a downside to some. There is a zippered slot inside the wallet, but with change inside it makes the wallet bulky. Personally, I prefer my change in a small coin purse anyways. It is tricky to get an ID in and out of the ID slot because there isn't a cutout in the plastic for your finger to push the card up. I anticipate that that problem will subside the more I use the wallet because the leather around the ID slot will soften. All in all, this wallet was exactly what I was looking for despite a couple of minor flaws. I would recommend it to others.	2015-08-02

These are pretty awesome shades!

I can honestly say, these are the worst boots I have ever worn. I purchased these boots and made the mistake of throwing my old worn out Carolinas away. I basically had to wear these for a two weeks. I wore them the first week and decided they were not for me because they hurt my feet so bad. They have an odd arch that continues to the outer edge of your foot opposite of the arch. I have to wear then a few more days while my new Carolinas were being shipped.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend these boots to anyone. Redwings should be ashamed of themselves for using their brand name to sell this junk.<br /><br />I have been wearing my new boots for two months and the pain caused by the Irish Setters is still there!	2015-08-02

I've owned Mizuno products prior and they were all of superior quality but this shoe is any but.  I've owned the Wave Rider 15 previously and they were an amazing shoe, especially for sprinters.  This show is ideal for neutral runners, but it is NOT anywhere as durable or as 'stiff' as most sprinters would like.  After just 3 months the show began tearing at the mess lining, keep in mind I'm on the track only 4 times a week doing no more than 1600m combined work.  Would not be looking to Mizuno for future sprint trainers.	2015-08-02

I have small calves and I spent years looking in stores for knee-high boots that I could wear with skirts and dresses without looking like I had chicken legs. Every single pair I tried was too big in the leg. So one day I took my calf measurements and searched Amazon. I rarely buy expensive shoes because I typically prefer quantity over quality but these are SO worth the money! They fit absolutely perfectly and are extremely well made. They are sexy but can also be paired with a knee-length dress for church without turning any heads. The small zipper at the heel is cute and the toe area isn't too pointy. I can wear these comfortably all day long and I can wear both nylons and socks with them. Highly recommended!	2015-08-02

Got my shoes and it fit well, until I started walking in them. I never had feet fart before but was very sad when it happened.. I couldn't go a size up or down because it would not fit.

Very good shoes!<br />Not sure why someone said these are more like &#34;work&#34; shoes. They definitely are NOT a work shoe. Also, they are not heavy as another reviewer suggested. Rather light weight, durable shoe and far from a &#34;heavy&#34; shoe. They are not &#34;extremely&#34; tight as someone said. They are a little snug/narrow. If in doubt get the wider width. They run true to size in length.<br />Whomever said the sole is big has no clue what a 'big' sole is. This is an average sole shoe. They are a bit loud when walking. The sole is semi-soft with insert pads on bottom.<br />The BORN Laughton are over all comfortable and very stylish, casual shoes that you could wear almost anywhere. Not a dress shoe.<br />I wouldn't consider them an all purpose shoe for Winter weather however.<br />BORN makes high quality, stylish, comfortable shoes. The BORN Axley are my favorite pair of shoes that I have. Get them. You wont regret it. More aggressive soles.  I wear them daily.<br />BORN makes quality shoes that I WILL purchase again in the future. They stand behind their shoes. I know from experience.	2015-08-02

I was trying to find heels that I could wear and walk around in all day at work. I haven't worn these all day yet, but I wore them for a couple of hours without my feet feeling uncomfortable. The heels are thicker than normal heels, and I think that helps make them easier to walk in. After reading the reviews left from other people, I thought I should order a half size up. That ended up being unnecessary, though. I think the shoes fit as expected. I normally wear a 6.5 and I ordered a 7. A 6.5 would have definitely fit, but I decided to stick with the 7 so I could put insoles in to make them a little more comfortable to wear all day. The straps on top were really loose. I had to put them in the last hole to get them to fit, but I have narrow feet so that might not be true with some people.	2015-08-02

The width is about average  and they are super comfy!  The top part is material like that of a wet suit so they move along when you walk. The bottom part is some sort of rubber that is great if you are in puddles or mud you can just rinse them right off.<br /><br />These boots are cute enough to wear with an outfit although maybe a little bit on the &#34;work&#34; look but they are sturdy enough to do yard work, barn work, etc.  I would purchase this style again!	2015-08-02

Case in point - Previous iterations of this boot had connecting fabric along the sides of the tongue which prevented dirt, pebbles, etc from entering the boot. New model has a minimal strip and now everything easily gets inside the boot. The new philosophy seems to be &#34;who cares how it works/feels as long as it looks good.&#34;<br />2) Parts of the tread are weakly attached to the sole of the boot, a few hours of normal walking around and you are looking for the Gorilla Glue to re-attach a loose piece of waffle-shaped rubber to the bottom of your boot.<br />3) New upper material is thin and stiff, so although the boot is light, it isn't comfortable and doesn't feel rugged. The boot feels like you are wearing the cardboard box the boots came in and not the boot itself.<br />The success of this line of boot has spawned numerous competitors and Oakley might be a victim of their own success. Although they helped popularize this particular style of footwear, their decision to emphasize looks over usefulness has cost them at least one longtime customer.	2015-08-02

The color is not accurate as shown in the photo - these are not a light powdery blue.  They are teal.  It is a beautiful color and luckily one that matches lots of my outfits, but if you are looking for baby blue, this is not it.

I work in a restaurant so i am on my feet all day. It is important to have shoes that don't hurt your feet. I have tried different styles from different companies and i have the same issue, no comfort. I have tried cheap shoes and expensive ones and both seem to be made the same. Good for non slip but terrible for comfort. These shoes are great. I usually add my own extra inserts into them for more comfort and they feel even better. Definitely recommend these shoes for restaurant use. &#62;:) My feet thank you.	2015-08-02

So I purchased these thinking I would have a similar experience. While the style and initial feel is good, I found that after an hour or so of walking/wearing these shoes, they really pinched my feet. The leather is not as soft as I would like and I think that's the primary reason they pinch my feet. Unfortunately, this makes these shoes unwearable and I am planning to return them. I wish they didn't pinch my feet.	2015-08-02

First of all, they fit as expected, which is always nice when ordering from Amazon. They also give you a good amount of heel lift, which is important for lifting shoes (it's the whole point!). The sole is quite stiff, and doesn't allow for much give, which maximizes your power transfer. The color combination looks good, in my opinion. If you're buying these for crossfit, I would say that running in these shoes isn't going to be the most comfortable, but it can be done. I haven't tried any other crossfit shoes before, so I can't say if another shoe would perform better for that. However, for lifting, it has really increased the amount of weight I can comfortably squat.<br /><br />My only worry with these shoes is the same as what others have posted. The velcro seems to be attached at only a small point on the shoe, and I worry that it will come off some day. I don't wear these enough to have worn through that yet, but I can see why others had issues with it (which is why this is getting a 4/5 star rating).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fits as expected<br />- Great color scheme<br />- Great for lifting (stiff and heel raise is perfect)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Longevity issues?<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these overall!	2015-08-02

At the listed price of $60 ($40 off) these are priced more for someone wanting to make a fashion statement.  If you're looking for good quality work boots then Timberland Pro, Red Wings, and Wolverine work boots are your better bet and look into the composite safety toe models to save on weight and still maintain the same level of safety as a steel toe.  Timberland Pro line also has boots for specific trades such as welding with high temp soles.	2015-08-02

I wear them more than any other sandal or slipper during summer. They have this supportive arch and massage nods and i can walk in them the whole day. Unfortunately the strips ripp often after only a couple of days and it is very cumbersome to return them in order to receive a replacement within the 2 year guarantee time. When I first start wearing them several years ago the material quality was very good and strong but with the years the quality declined in new flip flops, which is very disappointing. My first pair lasted at least 3 years, after that some pairs ripped after just a view times wearing them. I keep buying them in the hope that this new pair will at least last through the summer, but I get disappointed again and again. I guess I have to find an alternative brand that does not get me 'stranded' on the street with a broken flip flop.	2015-08-02

I do most of my exercise in a pool. The bottoms of my feet were getting roughed by the little irregularities at the bottom of the pool. I purchased these to combat that. Not only do they pad the bottom of my feet, they offer a bit of support and great traction for jogging in the shallow pool.<br /><br />I generally wear a 6.5 or 7, but these size six are large enough with room to spare. The only issue I have is that the strap is not quite long enough to strap across my right foot, which is misshapen due to an accident. Also, reviews mentioned the insoles fall out, so I proactively purchased Shoe Goo and glued the insole in to prevent that.<br /><br />Edited to add: I proactively glued down the insole, but then the fabric on top of the insole came off. This disappointments me greatly and I have changed my review from 4 to 3 stars.	2015-08-02

Very fast shipping (came in 5 days). The whole sizing issue with these is such a hassle, especially since I ordered a women's pair & I am a guy. Since they basically are the same boot as the guy's, just cheaper. I am a size 9 in US men & I ordered a size 10 in US women & they fit perfectly. They look good, are durable & are very good quality. They also came with yellow shoe laces! My only concern is that they came in a standard brown shoebox with no DM logo. I'm guessing it's because these are made in Thailand & not England?

I have had several NB trail shoes, and got these because they are cheaper than my last pair of minimus trails.  Overall they are good, but they slip in the heel on my right foot a bit, so my skin gets irritated there (but not quite a blister). The other thing is the seam by both my pinky toes rubs, and is uncomfortable there also.  My feet aren't wide, but I am used to the wider toe box of the other trail shoes I've purchased.  These are a little more narrow.<br />The tread is great, though, nice and rugged and I haven't slipped on dirt or grass. It has a nice amount of cushion, but not so much that it's overwhelming coming off of the minimus. However, I don't use these to run in, just work.	2015-08-02

Loved them so much and got so many compliments on them that I got the champagne color as well.  Both are very comfortable for me, but I should say that shoes with a significant built-in arch are not comfortable on me.  If you are looking for a noticeable arch support, this sandal may not be for you. (My feet are not flat, but I do pronate a bit.)  The &#34;jewels&#34; on these sandals are the most authentic and classy looking of all the jeweled sandals I've seen, even in the Kenneth Cole brand, which makes very nice sandals. They are finished well, have a very comfortable footbed, and a sort of felt-like material covering the rubber on the bottom which prevents the soles from marking the floors.  The footbed is the same material and color as the upper sandal and I believe it must be treated with an anti-microbial as I have no trouble with foot odor in these sandals.  I hope they never quit making these sandals!	2015-08-02

I really like these shoes, but have to give them a 3 rating because they hit at a spot on the side of foot where it caused a blister and got so bad that the blister popped as it continued rubbing untill i could go home. Even if they didn't rub against the side of my foot, they aren't comfortable for long term wear.  i also acknowledge the rubbing iss due to the shape of my foot, as i dont see many people having this problem, but i also have to point out that my other flats dont do this, so it was a real bummer. On the plus side, these shoes have a very classic, sleek design and while I think the other Jessica Simpson style with the toebox is cute, I'm not a fan of the squared toe look.   As most of the posters wrote, I agree this shoe is about a half size to one size small. If you like your shoes to have some extra wiggle room for your toes, then I'd recommend getting one size bigger since the straps will keep your foot in place. You can try it at Macy's prior to ordering online. There is a bit of toe cleavage, but I don't mind that.ut works better for the shape of my foot. Buyer beware, these shoes are a narrow fit, so if you have wide feet, it will not look flattering at all.Lastly, there is  about an extra quarter inch hidden wedge, so this flat has a heel height of about 3/4&#34; . It's nicely padded and well made.	2015-08-02

The velcro straps really hold your foot in the shoe tightly. Unfortunately, I was tripped by this shoe; and the ankle stayed tight in the shoe when my whole body fell on top of my foot. It resulted in a horrific broken ankle  injury/ It is 6 weeks today of an incredible ordeal. Just be careful and don't think you are all that secure because you are in low heels. That is not the case with these shoes.	2015-08-02

I love Asics and I always buy the same size - well, because my feet haven't changed.  This pair?  Fit about a 1/2 size too small.  My friends daughter who wears a half size smaller than I was able to take them and wear them just fine.  So - even though marked an 8, was actually a 7.5.	2015-08-02

The top of the slipper is right up against the ankle bones.  Good soles, good for a trip to the mailbox if you forget.  Fuzzy on the inside, felted wool on the outside.  If your feet are warm going in these are nice, if you are cold then you stay cold, but that seems to be on par for most slippers.  An adjustment to the hole to a more sculpted shape that drops below the ankle would make these a lot more comfortable.	2015-08-02

A close look at the shoe that failed (note: the part going round the heel ripped apart when I was putting it on) suggests that the construction is very shoddy.  Maybe I got a fake, but I bought them from Teva on Amazon, so go figure.  I've not experienced a similar failure in a shoe for as long as I can remember, so only one star.	2015-08-02

It's a great size to carry a tablet or book along with your usual stuff.  I have a purse organizer that pops right into this bag.  I like the subtle cheetah pattern.  The pattern is black and so is the purse, so it's mainly a pattern of texture.  The bag has many pockets and compartments to help keep you organized.  I like that it can be a shoulder purse, a cross body bag or a backpack.	2015-08-02

These sunglasses are extremely high quality. The lenses are quite large so they cover your eyes very nicely. They are dark lenses and fit comfortably without pinching.  I love that when I wear them, I get compliments and they look totally high end! Living in Florida, the summer sun is very harsh, but these block out rays so effectively that I don't have to squint.<br />These would be great glasses for not only you but for kids as well because they are durable, plastic, and easy to just throw in a bag for a day at the beach. They are very retro looking also which make them so cute!<br /><br /> I received these sunglasses in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

They fit exactly as expected at first, but then they stretch a little so they were slightly too big for me to wear comfortable.  I usually wear a 7 1/2 which is what I ordered the first time around.  I ordered the second pair in a 7, and they fit ok--not tight but no wiggle room either.  After a few wears they will be perfect!  If you're in between sizes, I suggest that you might want to size down.	2015-08-02

I have narrow feet, high arches a morton's neuroma, and swelling in one foot due to edema.. The liner that restricts access for some, provides the sides of my feet and my arches the support desired - even if the laces are loosened for swelling. I added regular OTC insoles as I did not like the texture of the rubber insole against my foot.  My first pair has been on several heavy walking tours and hikes during the past 15 months. They provide my feet the support they need while letting them breath.	2015-08-02

Unfortunately, like another purchaser noted about theirs, mine arrived crushed too! What was so odd about it is that the box was intact and pristine. There was no outer indication that the product inside was damaged. Were it not for the fact that I am familiar with straw hats and was able to manipulate it back into good condition (I had planned to where it out that night) I would have returned it. Any other product or time I would have sent it back. That being said, I will reiterate that this is a nice looking hat. It wears comfortably. In fact, today was a sunny 108. It was a perfect day to have on a straw hat. I get lots of complements when I where it and am looking to get a few more of different colors. Well, that's my two cents. I hope you find it helpful.	2015-08-02

When they arrived, one of the buckles was facing the wrong direction, poking out waiting to snag or stab something. I thought at first it was sewn on wrong, but then I realized I needed to pull out the entire top strap, flip it over and re-thread. Then I discovered the material inside the heel piece was glued/sewn on poorly, creating a ridge that would rub the bottom of the heel while walking. To top it off, the strap is too short and made the whole shoe very tight and uncomfortable. Returned.	2015-08-02

I bought them for crossfit and they work well for that, and are certainly cheaper than shoes marketed specifically for crossfit. As cross training shoes, they have absolutely no arch support, so don't buy these for walking or running. I chose to ignore the color description and thought these were going to be grey - they are, in fact, lavender as described. My bad. That said, the color is alright, though I would like to switch out the pink laces. They don't provide a ton of lateral support either, but again, good value for the money.	2015-08-02

Given the price, these are about as good as I could expect with better construction than I would have expected.  I can't say how long they'll actually last but they seem to be fairly durable.  Only time can tell how durable they actually are.<br /><br />A couple of things I think these sandals do really right are related to comfort.  The grey portion of the inner sole looks a lot rougher in the picture than it is.  It's squishy enough that it actually feels reasonably comfortable.  The band comes out of the sides instead of the top of the sole.  I've tried some where the band comes out of the top and the result is never pleasant.<br /><br />There's only a couple things I would change, given the chance.  I'd lighten the sole (and make it more flexible in the process) by adding deep groves to it width-wise.  I'd also shorten the band so it wouldn't cover my toes but I've yet to see any sandal that does that.  Due to the thickness and inflexibility of the sole, it's a little heavier than I'd like and it smacks down rather loudly when I walk down steps.  That said, these are very minor problems.<br /><br />As they are, if something ever happens to the pair I have, I'd easily buy these again.	2015-08-02

I found these to run a bit small, which was good for me since the smallest available was 6 1/2 and I usually wear a 6. The styling is great and the heel a perfect height - dressy, but wearable. They are fairly comfortable and very attractive, especially for the price. At least the left one is. My right shoe has a bad flaw on one of the narrow straps that looks like a spot of glue applied to repair a jagged edge that I ended up trimming with scissors. I would have exchanged them, had there been another pair available in my size. However, I need them for my granddaughter's wedding and don't think this spot will be noticeable to others. I have terrible bunions, and the straps seem to be placed so that they won't be unbearable for a long period of wearing. This is a frequent problem for me that is not the fault of most shoes, but my feet...	2015-08-02

There is almost no substance to these shoes, which I know is the point, but I am used to the NB minimal shoes, which have just a bit more feel to them.

I run in Vibram's so after walking around a bit I got used to the no-heel. The toebox more than adequate and I felt no squeeze even though I have wide feet. Over 100 miles in on them and no major issues than some rubbing on the back of my achilles<br /><br />The craftsmanship is a bit questionable. I was rather disappointed that on my first breakin hike, 2 eyelet came apart, and 2 more since then. It doesn't impact the fit or usability of the boot, though I do worry the laces will cut through the suade with no eyelet protection in the long run.	2015-08-02

Hope they stretch instead of tear over time.<br />UPDATE: After owning about a year, the uppers on both slippers split straight down the seam. They had not had that much wear in that time. My advice is if they fit snugly, don't keep them. Get a bigger size. I wear a 10d shoe size, these were a 10, and they fit so snugly they tore. I have relatively small feet for a size 10.Terrible for such an expensive slipper.	2015-08-02

I thought they might get a little more comfortable after a while but I have been using them for 2 months now and the strap is still too tight and if I wear them for couple of hours or so, they usually leave the strap mark on top of my feet. While I was able to wear my  previous Havaianas  for more than 2 hours, I cannot do the same with these ones.<br /><br />That is said, I am using these shoes when in the house as house slippers and/or if and when I got beach/ lakeside. Hence, they do the work. As a brand, I like Havaianas and I think I will get another pair not necessarily this model but with one with a more elastic strap.<br /><br />EDIT: Strap just broke and not because of overuse. I wear - used to wear- these at home most of the time and suddenly the strap just broke. I still like this brand but I think perhaps this specific model is not as study as other ones.	2015-08-02

Recently I had several problems with my feet, including a recurrence of plantar fasciitis in my left foot.  Only time heals that completely (if ever), but these Teva Tirra shoes feel great.  I can walk for quite a long time (I'm 82) without pain, and I can honestly say they are the most comfortable shoes I've had in recent years. I bought the size I normally wear, and they fit well all over, with plenty of adjustable straps.  They're rugged, they're comfortable, have a good arch support, and they look good.  What more could I want?  Well, they're not cheap, but I bought them on sale and feel I got a much better bargain than purchasing cheap shoes that don't fit or don't last.  I highly recommend them.	2015-08-02

They also fit comfortably on my nose - ...	The flip-up cover-up Aloha sunglasses are doing exactly what I want  them to do. There are times when performing activities outdoors in the bright sunlight when I need clear vision to complete a task. So being able to flip the sunglasses lenses out of my line of vision makes life much simpler. My hat size is 7 1/2  and they fit over my prescription glasses very comfortably. They also fit comfortably on my nose - I do not feel any appreciable uncomfortable weight on my nose. The sunglasses frame and lenses are sturdy and of good quality. I wear them with a retention strap for added support during vigorous activities outdoors. I highly recommend the flip-up cover-up Aloha sunglasses to anyone who wears prescription lenses and has an active life out doors in the sun light.	2015-08-02

US	5793631	R4GAUYZV8D8Q4	B00KY777JQ	108909301	Frye Womens Jesse Bohemian Sandal	Shoes	4	2	4	N	N	A Cautionary Tale of Shoes and Cigarettes	I bought these from the Frye website, so full disclosure.  I first ordered them in my normal size 7.5 but they were so tight across that I couldn't comfortably get my foot in the shoe.  Sent them back and got the 8.  Still a little tight but I could get my foot in the shoe.  I decided to take a chance and have them stretched.  I took them to a shoe repair place around the corner from where I work.  When I walked into the shop I noticed that the people working there must smoke like, 2 packs a day!  The smell was pretty bad.  I ended up leaving the shoes to be stretched.  It cost me $10.  I picked them up the following week and, in that time, the shoes managed to pick up the smell of cigarette smoke.  Damn shoes!!  Ok, I guess I should have known better but it truly didn't occur to me that my shoes would smell like they had an unfortunate smoking habit after being in  the shop for 5 days.  I'm telling you this because I don't want you to make the same mistake.  If you walk into a shoe shop and it smells bad, turn around and leave quickly or your shoes will be smelly thru no fault of your own (other than poor judgement).<br /><br />So how did these shoes fit after being stretched?  Well, the shoe guy stretched them too much in one place on the inside by my arch and this caused them to stick out a little.  That coupled with the fact that they smelled made me hate them and want to send them back immediately!  But I knew that I wouldn't get away with it.  So after glaring at them for several days, I placed the shoes in a plastic bag with a few containers of baking soda. After a day or two, I opened the bag- whew!  Smelly!  But the baking soda did the trick and absorbed the smell.  One problem solved, one to go.  I tried the shoes on again and realized that they were still the shoes I originally fell in love with even with the over-stretching so I decided to keep them.  So glad I did.  The problem resolved itself and they have molded to my feet in the best way possible.  Now, these are my new favorite shoes (no, really).<br /><br />Would I recommend these to you?  Definately!  As long as you have narrow feet or are willing to have them stretched.  Just be wary of 'Ole Smoky-The Shoe Repair Guy!	2015-08-02

I was on the market for a new set of daily-driver dress shoes for work due to my old pair wearing out. This was my first time buying shoes online so I did not have set expectations.<br /><br />From reading other Amazon reviews I was able to learn a few key points which made this buying experience successful:<br />-Formal shoe size is about 1 size less than well-fitting running or tennis shoes.<br />-These shoes have ample (medium) arch support<br />-Shoes for medium/narrow feet<br /><br />At this point it has been weeks and daily-driving these shoes has been great. The glossed look certainly seems to outshow my previous matte wingtips. I appreciate the shoe sole texture now with them on my feet- striped gripping rubber on the heel and smooth front-end. Shoe sizing was a deal-breaker for me, though with regular-sized feet I went with 1 size down from my running shoes and am glad I did.	2015-08-02

They were definitely too big and would come up in the back when I walked.  The second pair 10-10.5 fit perfectly.  However after a couple hours, these shoes really started to hurt me feet.  I almost sent them back, but after owning a pair of Ecco's before, and know they last and can be comfortable, I decided to try and wear them in.  That was a good decision.  It took a good month (a painful month), but now I can wear these shoes all day without pain.  They are actually really comfortable now.  They still look great and I can tell they will last many years like my black pair of Ecco's.  I really liked the look and style of these and am glad it all worked out.  If I didn't have that month of pain, and the size being too large, this would be a 5 star shoe.	2015-08-02

They are so comfortable and I'm always getting compliments on them. The boots gets slightly more slouchy the more you wear them but still look great. The only reason that I have to keep buying them is because I wear them to death. The first pair held up great. However, the second pair didn't last as long (the sole pulled apart from the boot at the heel) but that was my fault for not unzipping them when taking them on and off. I will be more careful with my new pair :)	2015-08-02

They seemed to offer handbags in a variety of styles at reasonable prices.<br /><br />When I saw this one, I fell in love. It looked like everything I wanted:<br /><br />-A practical crossbody bag roomy enough to hold all of my junk<br /><br />-A simple, classic design<br /><br />(I'm pretty sure my mom had a bag in the eighties similar to this one.)<br /><br />-A bag with great reviews<br /><br />This bag met all criteria, and best of all, the price was right. I placed my order, and two days later, the bag arrived on my doorstep. I was so excited.<br /><br />That excitement soon turned to disappointment.<br /><br />I did not have extraordinarily high expectations for this faux leather, no-name bag, but I've bought plenty of satisfactory faux leather, no-name bags at similar prices in the past 20 years. This bag was not a keeper.<br /><br />The bag was nicely packaged in a plastic Scarleton bag. The bag had an &#34;S&#34; on it in an elaborate font, and it also said Los Angeles. Ooh, fancy! The handles were individually wrapped for protection.<br /><br />Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but the bag comes with what appears to be a luggage tag. I've never had a luggage tag on a purse. Maybe it's for a photo? Regardless, mine was slightly different from the one in the photo. That's no big deal. I'm just pointing it out. If you don't want it, it can be easily removed.<br /><br />At first glance, the bag looked pretty decent. It has two main interior compartments that are separated by a zipper compartment. The interior fabric is brown, which would not have been my first color choice. However, compared to a black interior, the brown interior likely would make it easier for you to find your belongings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bag seemed very cheaply made. The exterior material felt like cheap plastic. You wouldn't be fooling anyone there. I don't see how anyone could ever mistake it for leather. The interior lining was even worse. It had a rough texture and felt--well--cheap.<br /><br />The bag itself is pretty photogenic, but in reality, it looked like they had cut every possible corner in making it. Maybe one star is harsh, but it's not a bag I would ever describe as nice. If I had seen this bag in a store, I would not have bought it at any price., but in reality, it looked like they had cut every possible corner in making it. Maybe one star is harsh, but it's not a bag I would ever describe as nice. If I had seen this bag in a store, I would not have bought it at any price.	2015-08-02

They have pretty good grip, so you can hike in all different terrains (although, they aren't the best with ice, so beware in snowy places).  They are waterproof, so you never have to worry about the rain.  I really can't express how much I love these shoes.  I wish they came in more colors!	2015-08-02

Catania Occhiali has succeeded in designing a nice pair of sunglasses in a fun shape that fit well on a small face.  There is no country of origin on the frames or literature, and there is no size designation imprinted either.  The gold frame is shiny and finished well, the plastic part is also finished well and very smooth, and each screw is secured.  The plastic lenses are gray in the pair I have and the protection from the sun is satisfactory for everyday wear.  I would not wear these for sports or perhaps on the water, but as fashion eyeware, they are superb.  Fortunately, I have a case in which to protect these shades because they are packaged simply in a plastic bag.  I received a pair for evaluation and judging from this pair, they are very well made and attractive.	2015-08-02

I've been wearing them in the house ever since I got them just to be sure they fit before I wore them outside. Once my feet got adjusted to them, I don't want to wear any other shoe.<br /><br />The first day I got these I wore them at least 5 hrs. (On carpeting, wood floors & ceramic tile). When I took them off before bed that night, my feet were killing me! The arches of my feet felt like they had a thousand needles sticking them! My feet continued to get that same feeling for another day when j took them off. However that feeling it lessened every day and now I don't have it at all.<br /><br />I had high arches and I think they've fallen(?) some over time. I believe the pain I experienced was probably from the shoe correcting my foot.<br /><br />I teach elementary school and plan on wearing these at least 50% of the time. They have a Nice, firm cushion foot bed that really cups your foot.<br /><br />As for sizing, I would recommend ordering your true size. I usually wear an 8.5 but got these in an 8. (I get a 9 in boots.) My feet are at the ends and barely staying on the sides. I would prefer the next size up but just decided to keep them because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of sending them back.	2015-08-02

The leather is very shiny but i dont think is real leather, since i brought a skechers real leather boots the same time i brought this. and Skechers boots have a very strong leather smell on it, and this dont have it. And its hard to get my fit into the boots. And the boots is very narrow even for the lady's feet. So guys want to consider skipping this is you find normal width is too narrow for you.  Update as of 16/08/2016: Brought this boots and worn only once and left it on my shoerack ever since. And today decided to bring it out for some action, but only to find the black leather starting to peel off, and exposing the grey internal. For sure this is fake leather.	2015-08-02

I bought these straight from their website. For the love of God, if you have CRONIC plantar fasciitis, DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES. I gave these over a month. First two days were like any shoe, a trial and stiff, and yet bouncy which made me hopeful. By week two I was crying again. I've had this condition for fourteen years. I know to what I speak. I still gave them extra time because they were a gift from my awesome and protective dad. I work anywhere from 32 - 51 hours a week depending on the season. It's on concrete, with the occasional rubber mat. So, yes. It's a bad job and conditions for the issue to begin with and I am in constant search for my best options. This is not it.

My feet are not a narrow and not a medium width--right in the middle and very hard to fit.  So I was very hopeful I'd find a dressier, more feminine sandal that actually fit, without all the adjustable Velcro straps that look a little sportier and casual to me than many of the places I go.  Unfortunately, the Velcro on the back strap of THIS shoe is not long enough to get a good fit on my narrow heel.  There is a good two fingers worth of room between my heel and that strap on the tightest I could get it (and worry that it might come undone, really).  So might as well be slides, which my orthopedic surgeon says are OUT for me, so it's not a safe shoe for me.  But it IS a lovely shoe and fit perfectly in the forefoot and midfoot..  Sad to return it.	2015-08-02

I’m a big fan of the Poetic License brand and have purchased many of their shoes in the past.  Since I am familiar with the sizing I was pretty confident ordering my regular size (8.5) in this shoe.<br /><br />I received the shoes quickly but was very disappointed when the first time I wore them the strap broke after walking about 100 feet in them.  I had just arrived at work so I had to walk around all day in a broken shoe.  Amazon was great about the return though, and I soon had a replacement pair.  I’ve had no problems with the replacement!<br /><br />The print on this shoe is adorable!  It has a lot of colors in it, but I don’t think it’s too hard to match.  I’m really happy to have found a cute, comfortable and unique flat - I’m finding that I want to spend less and less time in heels the older I get.  I like the little heart shaped pad on the ball of the foot - this is an improvement over older pairs of Poetic License shoes I have, which didn’t have any padding at all.  These did rub a little on the tops of my toe knuckles when they were still breaking in, but that seems to be improving.  I probably wouldn’t wear these all day long, or if I knew I was going to be doing a lot of walking - they have no arch support, but they are great for a day at work or for going out in the evening.	2015-08-02

I found Orthaheels, never got the arch supports and never looked back. Orthaheels are a perfect and fashionable fix for me.

I purchased these shoes for my son who will be on the golf team at his school. During this summer we have went and played golf at least twice a week and he would walk once, if not both. He tells me they are very comfy to walk in and provide a great amount of grip for not having real spikes. The only real problem with them is the laces get wet eventually, morning dew, sweat, dribbling drinks. This causes them to become untied at least once a match. Great shoes for a great price.	2015-08-02

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I am a sunglasses addict! I have a pair everywhere, in my car, purse, gym bag, diaper bag, my husband's car, etc. The problem, however, is that I'm a mom of three, and my kids are always finding them, wearing them, breaking them. So I usually get my glasses at Five & Below, the dollar store. These were such a wonderful pair to review! They fit my head perfectly, very sturdy, even on my nose. They came with a case and a small bag to store them in. I'll most likely keep these away from the kiddos for as long as possible. ;-)	2015-08-02

I tried on boots from LOWA, Merrell, Oboz, Vasque...then settled on Scarpa Terras.  With the exception of Salomon boots run a half size larger), the rest all seem to run a half size to a size smaller than labeled.  The difference with the SCARPAs is that after sizing up from a 44 to a 45, the boots fit as if they were molded to my feet.  Sized up, the arch was in the right spot. Sizing up gives you more room in the toe box, which is slightly pointer at your everyday size.  Now, pull the speed laces...truly a pleasure to cinch up the SCARPAs, quickly and without fuss.  The boot has stood up well to repeated hiking.  It is a responsive boot, providing good trail feel while connecting you to the surface underfoot, without exposing you to rocks and rills as many of the sneaker type designs will.  The Scarpas provide excellent ankle support.  Best of all, you feel as if the boot is a part of your leg rather than a clunky add on; they are surprisingly light and move with you seamlessly.  If you upsize right off the bat, you will love this boot.  Pound for pound, it is the best boot that I have ever owned for trail hiking.	2015-08-02

Those have been the best and only shoe I could buy and not have foot pain. I wanted something with more cushioning and most of the max cushioning shoes are not wide foot friendly. I can safely say that by going up half a size in the Altra shoes that I have a very good fit in the toe box. If I went with an 11 then it would've been way too small in the length.<br /><br />My feet are happy that there is a max cushioning shoe that fits them. The only downside I find is that the shoes make my feet very warm compared to my Asics. I still wouldn't hesitate to buy these again.	2015-08-02

She scored some awesome shoes from the bowling alley that went out of business! Sorry guys! They're all gone...but it was fun digging thru the bucket to find the amazing colors. I had to get two different sizes but they're marked on the outside.. Unlike Nike's shoes ( take note here Nike) so that was fine. And it's fun to hob nob with the finest at garage sales! You can barter on the price! Poor Kanye. He'll never know this joy of garage sale bowing shoes if he's limiting himself to all those 6,000 shoes! Now I can buy that mini gun I've been eyeing! Yay!	2015-08-02

Just as with all of his previous Sanuks, one size larger than his usual size fits him nicely. I'm not sure he likes them because he knows that is the only kind of surfing he is likely to accomplish, or if it is because they are &#34;sandals&#34; that cannot pick up pebbles, or something else entirely. I just know that he uses these any time he is not wearing sneakers and that includes wearing them as house slippers in the evenings. This makes ME happy because it means he no longer wears flip flops, therefore I am not annoyed by that incessant 'slap-slap-slap-slap' sound when he is pacing about. This time, I got him the acid washed denim look because I recently came across some of his awesome 1980s basketball shorts. I thought it would be fun to see the kids' reaction to &#34;80s throwback Dad&#34;. No, not really. I actually got them because they are brighter than most of the Sanuk patterns and with the white soles they just looked perfect for summer	2015-08-02

They are perfect to wear over skinny jeans. Extremely comfortable! I have small calves so it's very hard to find boots that don't look huge.

The heel looks a bit thin/unstable in the picture but I thought they were very sturdy. These boots also come with an extra set of heels which is nice. The lace-up strings are really hot! It is hard sometimes to keep them tied! A lot of times I'll be walking around work and the ties will start flapping against my legs. But honestly, it's a small price to pay for such a cute boot.

US	46368748	R3BZBO5JZ9X5QL	B00L5KR0ZC	131433075	Native Jefferson	Shoes	3	4	6	N	N	Cute but some caveats.	I bought these for a 10-day annual river trip in California. The river is very rocky, so it's essential to have water shoes. In past years, I have worn Crocs, but they have their issues, so I wanted to try something new. I first saw these on my 2-year old nephew and when I learned they came in adult sizes, I couldn't wait to try them out. First thing to know is that they look fantastic. Very cute shoe. They are also quite comfortable when just walking around. My feet (which are prone to getting too hot) were not too hot in these. However, they turned out not to be that great on the water. They got a ton-- and I mean a TON-- of rocks in them. I'd shake out the shoes after being on the river for a few hours, and dozens of pebbles would fall out, every time. OUCH. In terms of sizing, I'm an 8.5 and these were only available in 8 or 9, so I went with the 9 based on reviews. They are slightly too big, especially in the length (which might explain some of the pebbles), but I'm pretty sure a size 8 would have been much too tight across the top of my foot. So I'm giving them three stars for just being okay. They look good but could fit better and could definitely do a better job of keeping the rocks out. However, if you're just going to use them at the pool or someplace that is not full of rocks or sand, these will probably be excellent. I do agree with other reviewers and suggest that if you're in between sizes, you go up rather than down. It won't be a perfect fit, probably, but nothing is worse than shoes that are too tight (and these do not stretch out when wet-- the opposite, in fact.)	2015-08-02

I went a 1/2 size up from my regular shows and this was perfect. I have a narrow foot so I think it would not be a good match if you have a wide foot.  This fits me like a glove. In case this helps - in all of the Vasque leather boots with insulation a 9M is way too big for me so don't match your size off of other Vasque boots. Toe box is a good fit with a light sock for me- a full cushioned sock makes the toe box too tight.<br /><br />I have not been able to test water proofing from the Gore-Tex yet, but these feel like my old Basque Breeze's of the past- at least so far.	2015-08-02

Used them for about an hour to walk on a rocky beach that was not suitable for bare feet. I thought they felt a bit weird, and when I got out of the water I noticed that the glue between the pad and the inside of the shoe was soft, and the pad was moving all over the inside of the shoe, bunching up. I went to the local beach shop and bought a different pair. No problems.<br />After these shoes dried, the bottom pad seemed secure again. Doesn't make sense to have a water shoe that gets affected by water, does it?<br /><br />I would say the shoes look nice, but the pad is going to come apart on you. They need to find a better way of securing the pad in the bottom.	2015-08-02

I saw these Sperry’s when I was browsing around for comfortable shoes to wear on vacation.  When I saw the cute print I was sold!  These shoes were comfortable right out of the box - maybe a tiny bit snug, but not enough that it would cause blisters.  They have only gotten more comfortable over time!  I love the colors on these shoes.  They aren’t too loud since the toe of the shoe is the “linen” color, but the print on the upper and the pink mesh on the sides gives it that “pop”.  I’m a shoe lover, so I like it when my shoes have that little something extra.<br /><br />I love that the sides are mesh - it makes the shoes so cool and comfortable on a hot day.  I can be on my feet all day in these and still feel good.  They’ve gotten plenty of water dripped on them and they still look good as new too.  I’ve worn them both with liner socks and without and they feel good either way.<br /><br />I did notice the shoes were rubbing a little bit on the top of my feet for a few days when they were breaking in, but it didn’t ever cause any blisters and whatever the trouble spot was, it has worked itself out now.  Love these shoes!	2015-08-02

Prior to placing my order, I was toggling back and forth trying to decide on colors since I was purchasing as Christmas presents for my daughters. I realized the prices varied but that happens frequently on Amazon with color selections, so I did not notice the stylings were changing with each toggle. Upon receiving the shipment of the organizers, I realized the black, from LilGift, is different from what is depicted here and does not expand as the brown and bronze from Yagoozon. Rather than expanding horizontally, the black organizer has a fold down fabric which can be extended vertically. If you are looking for a horizontal expandable purse organizer, order a color other than black. As far as the functionality of the organizer, I believe it will help my daughters keep their totes and purses organized but I will have to decide who gets the one that does not expand horizontally.

I'm a female and had to get the male shoe because the women's never fit quite right in the largest size. My shoe size is normally and 11 in women's and occasionally a 12 depending on the shoe. I immediately noticed a difference in my squat depth and form from the first day I wore them. My deadlifts are cleaner and I am able to isolate better. I definite would recommend these shoes. They initially fit a little snug, but not uncomfortable. They have since loosened up to a very comfortable fit.	2015-08-02

I am a big Poetic Licence fan, and have many pairs but they are mostly heels.  I’ve been trying to get away from wearing heels so much (just not practical for my work environment!) so I was happy to find some cute flats from one of my favorite brands!  I loved the colors of these shoes - especially since green and gold are my universtiy colors!  There are other colors besides those of course, but it’s a subtle nod to the Bears :)  The colors make them a little hard to match with outfits, but if you stick with more solids and aren’t afraid to go bold, there are plenty of things to wear them with!<br /><br />These shoes are pretty comfortable, and felt that way right out of the box.  The strap doesn’t dig in and the heel doesn’t rub.  If I walk a long way in these the edge of the toe section does start to rub on the knuckles of my pinky and big toes.  It hasn’t caused any blisters yet, but I probably wouldn’t wear these out if I knew I was going to be doing a lot of walking.  The rubbing may improve if they break in a little more too.  I also appreciate the little heart padded section underneath the ball of the foot. Just makes the shoe a little more comfy.  You can probably tell this from the pictures, but there is no arch support in this shoe.  Still - I recommend these for a cute and different flat!	2015-08-02

He ordered his regular size of 10 and had to return them because they were too small.  The 10.5 size fit perfectly and he was able to travel 28 miles without any blisters pain or discomfort.  The terrain was prairie grass, dirt, rocks and mud. The shoes did not rub anywhere and provided excellent support.  The traction was amazing without any slipping and great grip going up and down hills.  Would highly recommend	2015-08-02

I'm always stretching and rolling out my feet and legs because of the plantar fasciitis. Upon a friends recommendation I bought this pair to try. They are Very comfortable and stylish and seem to be well made.  I can wear these all day. I even bought another pair of fit flops in a different color. I don't think I'll ever buy another pair of flip flops that are not Fit Flops. They are worth every penny.	2015-08-02

I have grown accustomed to Sketchers relaxed fit so much that I have bought 8 or ten pairs this year.  This one seems a little narrower than the others and conversely seems to give a little more support than the others.  Due to a back injury I have a great deal of numbness and neuropathic pain in my feet and these are the most comfortable shoes I have found.  One caveat though:  I don't wear the same pair every day and seldom two days in a row as they seem to get &#34;wet&#34; and lose their comfort.  They don't have a great deal of arch support, and sometimes i wear a prescribed custom orthodic for arch support.  I have bought two pairs of this style and seem to wear them the most of the variety I bought.  I have found these canvas shoes to be great in the summer with no socks.  I like the leather ones too, but only in cooler weather.	2015-08-02

I normally wear a 5, bought a 5.5 and although they're understandably larger, it isn't by much. I prefer my boots to have a little more room for my foot, though. My calves and shin don't wiggle around but they could probably be loosened up if you needed more room. I don't care for the laces, so when I get around to it, I will be changing those out. I wish they were black, but they lean more grey; which, really, sets them apart from your standard &#34;combat boots with zippers and buckles,&#34; so it's fine.

I love these shoes wore them to yellow stone and when crossing a river you could arguably say I should not have one of the shoes got tore up but something unseen in the water. two of my toes where injured at well and I know if not for them I would have had to make a trip to er. I love these shoe much I bought a second par as soon as I got back. They do not have arch support but are comfy none the less and I have very flat feet and being a size 11 it is hard to find comfy shoes that are cute. these shoes are both and stud up to a lot of abuse at yellow stone.

The camel color was my favorite. I thought the cork look with the little spots of color was so unique, and I loved the heel height.  I’ve ordered many shoes from this brand in the past so I was pretty confident ordering my regular size - 8.5.  The price was right so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these shoes to be a little tight and stiff.  I can get them on in the morning, but if I’m on my feet much during the day and my feet swell at all the shoes don’t feel very comfortable.  If I could go back and order a size up I would, but they are out of stock.  I do like the little heart shaped padding on the ball of the foot, though.  And these may get more comfortable if I make an effort to get them broken in.  I don’t know if I will take the time for that though.<br /><br />In the end, I’m going to keep them because I really do think they are attractive and interesting shoes.  I think they are a good neutral shoe, with some fun visual interest.  I’ll try them again when the weather gets cooler, and they are ok for wearing a few hours at a time, but I won’t be wearing them to work if I know I’m going to be running errands after - they just aren’t comfortable enough for that.	2015-08-02

However, after walking in them, my foot kept leaning inward, which is awkward because it has never done that in any other shoe.

Maybe I will try them again, but it takes some readjustment of your walking to be comfortable in this shoe.	2015-08-02

However over time their quality and size are shrinking.  The leather is replaced with a vinyl plastic, I have to go up to near 1 to 1.5 sizes larger to get a good fit and then at times they are still tight.  Cushion and support are great.  I have since started looking for another running shoe that can give me what Asics used to do.  But I am sorry to see a good product go bad.  These shoes I think are more costly than they really should be.  I will know in the future I will have to shop for them in a store, but they are basically unreliable in size and quality over the net.	2015-08-02

Currently (I've worn them only twice since I got them), the shoes are a bit narrow and I'm wearing them only a couple hours, but they will be fine soon, I'm sure. The color is brighter than I usually wear, but I do like the lilac color and they will be fine with black slacks and dark jeans.  I got these because I have another pair of the Anna shoe that I purchased years ago and I really like them. The old shoes are wearing out some so I wanted a new pair to keep this option of a true slip-on (but not a mule) shoe. The Anna style has a short perpendicular lip on the heel so my heel doesn't slide out easily or flap like with mules. Sadly, the Anna style was discontinued. I tried the new version (Walking Shoe Slide? something like that is the name) and it has a sloped heel lip (instead of perpendicular) so my heel came out easily and thus they did not suit me. When I first looked at the Anna lilac on Amazon a few months ago, my size was not there, but a couple weeks ago, my size was there, so I got them and am very happy!	2015-08-02

Had to send these back like many other people because of the boot being too SMALL. I was really hoping that my boots would be the right size and I was wrong, no 1/2 sizes at 14EE so I am moving to a 15D. The boot seems very light and super comfortable and the width was dead on for the little time i had them on.Looking forward to the next set to try.<br /><br />**Update on size**  8/11/15<br /><br />14EE was too short and big toe rubbed with no socks ( returned item)<br />15D was just right and the width was great also.<br /><br />**Update**<br />Got to wear these for 1 week straight and just love them, insole at the heel is starting to flatten out some. Happens to all my shoes.	2015-08-02

They are a bit dressier than regular flip flops, yet have all the functionality. I wear these for kayaking. yep. You can step into the water, even if the bottom is rocky or muddy, and they stay on. Because the top part hugs the foot higher than normal flip flops these stay on in the water, while your toes are free and comfortable. In the kayak, it's easy to kick them off and then slip then on when you need it. When I'm done kayaking, and we go to lunch or dinner, I don't have to switch shoes. I wash them out in the lake, and they are good to go - function, comfort, and style. How often do you find that in one shoe???<br />I went to visit my mom in Florida and she appropriated these. Did I mention how soft and comfortable the footbed is? It's like walking on a cloud. So... now I have to buy another pair.	2015-08-02

I like how light these shoes are. The length and width were what they should be for my size (10). The problem I have run into is that  they have a very low instep and are tight across the top of the foot. A wider shoe or a size up would alleviate this discomfort, but the shoe would be either too long or too wide if I upped either of these measures. I'll keep them and wear them occasionally since I like them, but I won't buy another pair once these wear out.<br /><br />FWIW I have several pairs of Rockport Rocksports type shoes.

My eyes are green and are especially sensitive to light and so I can say that these sunglasses do provide adequate protection. It is wonderful to have  sunglasses that are chic and also have a  dark gray shade of lenses to screen out  the sun’s glare effectively. I always thought  these rich and famous sunglasses were difficult to find, so when I had a chance to evaluate them, it was sweet at last to have effective and yet glamorous shades!

No case was included.<br /><br />The offer moderate sun protection and are easy to see through.  Visibility is possible inside with these on, but they do darken the view a fair bit.  They are not mirrored sunglasses.<br /><br />My son liked these when he saw them and wanted a closer look.  When they arrived he put them on, looked in the mirror, and declared them \\\"Totally in tune with anime ultimate villains.\\\\\"  Which, since he liked them, I assumed was a huge compliment.  He found them to be very cool.  He's 19, and his head size is large.  They fit him well.<br /><br />They have plastic tortoiseshell rims and arms, and gold colored rims and details.  The nosepieces have some silicone pads for comfort and to keep them from sliding down.<br /><br />They don't look super durable, but they aren't super expensive either. (About $14 in early August 2015)  I'd recommend these if you really like the look.  These are not small John Lennon glasses, the frames are much bigger, measuring about 2\\\\\" diameter.

Know what you are getting into before you buy. I have an NVidia Shield tablet and so was expecting the same or better out of the NVidia Shield. Instead, even though the Shield has better and more versatile hardware, its software (version 1.3) is drastically reduced (Android TV instead of Android, Plex TV instead of Plex Android, lack of muliple account support, limited search results, etc..) which greatly cuts back on its capabilities. Hopefully in the future they will fix the software and turn it into a great device.  Comparison of NVidia Shield Tablet and the NVidia Shield: NVidia Shield Tablet: 1. Runs Android 2. Casts to TV either via it HDMI connector or ChromeCast 3. Plays all Android games and steams them all to TV. 4. Supports full Plex, Netflix, etc for video streaming. Full search, folders, and full music shuffle in Plex. 5. Has PC game streaming. 6. Supports multiple users accounts through Android OS.  NVidia Shield: 1. Runs Android TV. 2. Cast to TV via HDMI connector. 3. Plays only those few Android games chosen to be playable for TV (even though they really all are). 4. Uses a reduced Plex TV version software that does not provide the functionality of the Android or PC versions of Plex; does not support folders, only shows first 15 in a search so cannot get through a series if it has more than 15 episodes without having to resort to scrolling down through a list of ALL. Plex music section also does not Shuffle the entire list, you must first go into an album or collection of songs and it'll shuffle only those. By comparison Plex for Android lets me Shuffle my entire Music library straight from the root level. Also, voice search does not work in Netflix, will revert to typed input. 5. Has PC game streaming. 6. Does NOT support multiple user accounts (either through the shield, Plex, or PC Games). Be careful, if this is for a family whoever uses their account opens themselves up for everyone. For the software it is safest to log out of everything when done playing or you may find your kid got into your adult movies, or played over your favorite PC game.  Bottom line: If you are single or don't mind other people having access to your account and save games or you just want a simple interface then this is a pretty good device with potential to maybe be an awesome device in the future. But is you are more of a power user and want to &#34;have it all&#34; then you might want to wait and see where they go with this because you are not their target audience.	2015-08-02

Just remember if you have a controller with batteries to take the batteries out first so when you pass its id on to the device the controller doesn't attempt to retain it by remaining powered after you unplug it.  If you read the instructions you'll probably know what I mean.  If you have a really nice controller you'd like to use on all of your systems than you should consider this device a solid choice for achieving that end.	2015-08-02

This is a great bundle (provided you like how the case looks) and IMO a great deal. I don't buy consoles very often and I consider myself a casual game player; I play on this probably 4-6 hours a week. Maybe more, because it's so easy to pick-up and put down all day exactly where you left off just by closing it.<br /><br />I owned the very first DS when it came out and I had been thinking for a long time about upgrading. 3d as a feature wasn't a big seller for me but I love how it's used in this. The 3d camera feature is pretty fun even though it's novelty wears off quickly, but the 3d games look AWESOME. Esp. the one that comes with it. And they make it so convenient to toggle the level of 3d and even turn it off super easily based on how far you hold it from your face.<br /><br />Nintendo so often gets it just right; they get what is fun and appealing and realize how colorful and fun graphics can even top more advanced and detailed graphics the other systems have. Downloading games is convenient and easy. I thought a couple of game downloads would take up all the storage on the thing without an additional memory card but so far still has plenty of room. The battery last a good long time and it charges very quickly. I love taking this with me for times when I'm waiting during the day and I love playing during free times.<br /><br />This is a great all-around hand console with a nice big screen that I think most people would love. When I first got it I thought it was bulky compared to my original DS but I adjusted quickly and now prefer the bigger screen. My only minor gripe is that the volume slider is right where you hold it on the right and I'm sure will get even looser, so you end up unintentionally increasing the volume while you play.<br /><br />I'm pretty frugal and this was a big purchase for me someone who isn't a heavy gamer. I have bought many games (I check the reviews and so far I've really liked all of them) and I'm so happy with this purchase.	2015-08-02

I received this in great condition (much more than the last one I ordered) and I found that it functioned just as expected. This joystick allows more functionality than the original NES controller. It allows you to go super fast in Mario Brothers and super slow. I loved this for doing more in Mario Brothers and I even played better than with the original controller. However, you might ask, &#34;Should I buy it?&#34; Honestly, probably not. This is more of a gimmick than something that actually does something useful, and if you find it for a cheaper price, then I would consider it if I were you.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Allows more functionality in games, such as controllable super fast modes and slow modes, multiple A-B button input with just the touch of A or B once.<br />-Better controllable than other controllers/joysticks<br /><br />CONS:<br />-More of a gimmick than something useful	2015-08-02

Hours of game play, and the game play is truly amazing. It looks great and its very easy to pick up and dive right in. You end up saying one more mission, then three hours later..... So much to do, its just a big adventure! Heck half the time I just drive around and run through the jungle. So much to do you cant get bored. As a bonus the Co-op is just as fun. You can basically do the whole game with a partner. If you don't have this yet you should get it, even if you haven't liked past far crys there is just so much to do with this one, I would recommend giving it a try, save 4 karat.	2015-08-02

But slowly over the course of its dozen + hours did I finally lose all patience with it. There came a point when I simply wanted to run past enemies. Not because I couldn’t defeat them or because I didn’t need any more experience points, but because the combat just becomes a tiring slog. Near the end, enemies take so many hits, use so many unblockable attacks, and countering seems so ineffective and useless so often that whatever fun there was had long since evaporated. And of course there’s hardly a moment that goes by when playing “LoS2” that you aren’t bombarded by help tips flashing across the screen, constantly reminding you to spend your experience points, or to check out the artwork you’ve unlocked, or to use one of the many abilities you have to solve the sometimes frustrating environmental puzzles. Sure, you could turn it off in the options. But when you find yourself stuck, you’ll have to keep turning it back on. Only in NG+ when you’ve figured everything out can you rid yourself of this aggravation, which don’t just stay on the screen for a second, but remain there, pulsing, making a little repeating chime sound as if to say, “do what I tell you!” Then there’s the design of the world itself, which is an incoherent mess to navigate through. Instead of being broken up into levels or missions, it’s structured similar to past Metroidvania style games in the series, or tries to be, where various sections of the world are linked together, except this time without a helpful map to guide you. There’s no sense of space or location. No way to tell which way is which other than by depending entirely on the waypoint of the mini map. The story – I defy anyone who hasn’t spent hours reading up on it to explain it. I could go on. I wanted to like this game. I like the “Castlevania” series. “LoS2” has terrific visuals and a combat system that’s fun enough on a basic level, but everything else that surrounds it is either undercooked or just frustratingly bad.  Note 1: I should add, the &#34;stealth&#34; sections made me want to throw my controller at the wall.  Note 2: I have experienced a bug that crashes the game whenever you return to a specific area. Some have reported saves being corrupted.  --- 2 STARS ---	2015-08-02

I opted to not switch out the d-pad as it seemed to be made of plastic and preferred both the look and quality of the original d-pad over this one. The thumbsticks seemed slightly different in color compared to the picture. I would also advise caution when taking apart the controller to install these, to avoid damage to the controller. There are videos on how to do so. It may also be sensible to look into getting thumbstick covers to make long gaming sessions more comfortable I purchased the [[ASIN:B003NSLGW2 Grip-iT Analog Stick Covers]] for use with these and it works very well.

Now for the review of the product...lol Sound quality is excellent. Can't hear anything in the room when they are fully on my ears. The headset is small and tight so it was uncomfortable the first several times wearing them but now they have stretched some so its more comfortable. They make my ears HOT! These should be great in the colder months. I love how the mic raises and lowers to turn it on and off which is VERY convenient when you have small children or noises you need to block out during game play. I primarily just connect it to my PS4 game controller so I am not &#34;attached&#34; to the playstation, but if you want more control over the sound then they offer a connection cord directly to the PS4.	2015-08-02

I figure that is because I like what I like, and that's basically all there is to it.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but in my opinion this is the greatest video game ever made.  While I lack the time to devote to games as I did in my youth, I have still managed to log in close to 700 hours on this game.  I've played it start to finish more times than I can count.  Bugs and all (in the vanilla version) it's still spectacular.  If you're getting into it for the first time you might find it so buggy that's it intolerable.  Find and download the Zone Reclamation Project mod, which fixes many of the vanilla bugs.  For content enhancing mods, consider STALKER Complete 2009, or (my favorite) Autumn Aurora 2.1.  The moodiness and atmosphere cannot be matched in any other game (I've looked for a similar experience).  Enjoy!	2015-08-02

I have been a fan of Nancy Drew games ever since it came out when I was a child. I have finished every single Nancy Drew game there is--except this one.

But ugh...<br /><br />This game has sooooo many chores and the story line is a mess so far. I hated doing the timed kayak challenge with the buoys and I've yet to finish it.

Visually it is pretty unimpressive, but that is to be expected from a game of its age. The audio is solid, though I did find that the sound of lurking zombies to not always be a good guide as to how close they may be, or what direction they may be coming from. Despite that the audio is still where this game shines, providing a cheezy horror flick tone that just fits this game perfectly, setting a mood that keeps this exhausted genre oddly refreshing.<br /><br />Solo campaign is for sure challenging, which is probably why I found myself enjoying this game a lot more when it was with the company of others. Just seems a lot more manageable that way, and the player revives make a huge difference and take away a lot of the frustration that was experienced when playing alone. It also just feels like a game that is meant to be played with others as communication among teammates was often what made or broke apart a group. Finding a group doesn't take too long but this game is flying under most people's radar so the community really isn't there just yet.<br /><br />Just wish a few little game modes were included, such as a firing range so you can get a feel for some of the weapons that the game offers. Not having this isn't a deal breaker, but would have been appreciated as the options of campaign mode and horde mode don't leave me feeling fully satisfied in the variety, not for the retail price of $49.99 at least.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy I picked this game up. The Zombie theme is definitely growing old, but Zombie Army Trilogy is still very enjoyable and a great option if you're looking for a game to play with friends.	2015-08-02

I actually had and used this for a while,<br />It might be my bad luck, but what usually happens is:<br /><br />1. plug it<br />2. place the controller+battery in position - there is are 2 positions for up to 2 controllers.<br />3. no led light - not sure it charges or not.<br />4. wiggle it/shake it/ switch position for about 5 minutes, until I get lucky and see a led light.<br /><br />It will charge after that, but I would prefer it without 4.<br />Also, there is only one time I remember I could see the led light and charge 2 remotes at the same time.	2015-08-02

Granted, PM has been a straightforward RPG ever since the beginning. And of course, it is totally reasonable for people to have been deeply disappointed when it did not follow the same formula. It IS a very flawed game, no doubt about it. But I still think people should at least give it a try (especially if it is at a bargain bin price), and here is why:<br /><br />The Soundtrack<br /><br />The soundtrack is one of the better parts of this game. I don't think I have ever heard a Mario soundtrack as awesome as this one. Very jazzy, full of life, and I like how they remix old tunes.<br /><br />No &#34;Experience&#34;<br /><br />I like how this game handles battle rewards. One main gripe from people who played it is that you get no &#34;experience&#34; and thus each battle is pointless. I beg to differ. You get coins after each battle, coins which you use to buy Thing stickers, which are powerful and fun to watch in battle.<br /><br />And no, you don't get experience in the traditional sense. In most games, you can simply grind to beat enemies and bosses. Not so here. You get experience by learning the ins and outs of the stickers you have collected. You learn how best to time your button presses for each different sticker (a la Mario and Luigi games), and you learn which stickers work best against each type of enemy. If anything, this game does the concept of &#34;experience&#34; right, whereas other RPGs simply let you get by through the accumulation of points, which make your character hit harder. That's not really experience, if you ask me. It's more like a Zelda game (an action RPG). You do get experience, but not in the form of points you accumulate. Instead, you learn which of your weapons works best against which type of enemy, how long to charge a weapon, and where to hit an enemy.<br /><br />The Visuals<br /><br />This is another part that I think was done excellently. Paper Mario was made to be played in 3D. This game is a perfect example of why. Everything just comes to life. You really have to experience it for yourself, IMO.<br /><br />The Writing<br /><br />No, you don't really get a good story. However, its obvious that the game had good writers anyway. Most toads say funny things that actually make you chuckle. There are some absolutely brilliant parts, where I am sure the game would have been even better had they made the story an even bigger part of the game. But as it stands, the game has better writing than some of the Mario and Luigi RPGs. Overall, it's very witty and charming. No, none of the toads have names, but they all say the darnest things. And the way in which the writers describe &#34;Things&#34; in this game is brilliant, and full of comedy. You won't be LOLing, but it'll make you smile and giggle.<br /><br />In terms of writing, I would say it goes like this:<br /><br />Bowser's Inside Story&#62;Superstar Saga&#62; Sticker Star&#62; Partners In Time&#62; Dream Team<br /><br />Overall, I say TRY this game. If you don't like it, sell it. But it's worth a try in my opinion. Don't expect an old school Paper Mario and you may come to like it too.	2015-08-02

It seems to charge fine when the system is closed, but don't bother trying to use it while it's charging - it will flicker on and off, and it's not clear if it's really charging at all. I tested all possible issues and the cord is the only difference between a proper, non-flickering charge and what it's giving (different cord, same outlet, same adapter, etc). It works as long as you just need it while the 3DS is closed and off, but it's not ideal.	2015-08-02

Well, the good thing is that it definitely looks really nice and it comes with all the parts needed to make this happen. I used this and a black face plate I bought elsewhere for a really nice black/blue PSP. The main reason I took away a star is the screwdriver. It isn't magnetic, which makes this entire project THAT much more time consuming and bothersome. The online guide didn't help much. I looked it up on youtube, still didn't help. So BE WARNED, you'll have to wing quite a bit. Also, if you're not a steady handed person with a bit strength, don't do it. It's not worth, let me tell you. I stripped pretty much every screw while I was taking my PSP apart, and when I was putting it back together, screws gave me such a hard time! I ended up ruining my LCD screen, the mic piece just isn't going back in, I'm pretty sure the speakers are screwed, too. It's just such a difficult task. I know this review sounds mostly negative, but keep in mind, the negative is mostly the experience overall. The product itself is a 4!	2015-08-02

In fact i rarely play them. So far the RPG that have made an impression on me are chronologically star wars KOTOR, Jade Empire both on the original xbox and this one right here: The Witcher 3. I was skeptical all through the release. But i took a leap of faith. Boy am i glad i did. In typical RPG fashion yes it's a little slow. You travel distances to get somewhere and talk to people before starting a quest and it can go back and forth several times. But i found that travelling on horseback to get to a far location on the HUGE map is a good way to take the beautiful vistas of the game. So many details have been poured in this game from the wind blowing through the leaves of trees, to the intricate landscape design. Gameplay wise the same level of care has been applied. The character development, the various items and spells you use in a fight, weapons, armor crafting etc... To go into detail would require a lot of time to explain how the many masterfully designed mechanics work and it is best to leave that pleasant surprise to you. Since patch 1.07 mechanics work much more smoothly since launch.<br />The story is very engaging although the main quest was a little short for my taste. But to make up for it there s a seemingly endless number of secondary quests and witcher contract that allow you to level up in between main quests.<br />This is truly a next gen Game and i hope future games, RPG or not take the same level of care to polish their games as this one is.	2015-08-02

I was looking for a stylus that extends because the one that the 3DS XL came with feels a bit small in my hand, so this one works out very well! It feels sturdy, doesn't scratch the screen, and looks cute with Rilakkuma's head poking out of the 3DS. I'm very pleased with the quality of the paint job on the face, it looks perfect. I totally recommend this to anyone who like cute accessories for their tech.	2015-08-02

Last June I decided to finally get in shape and lose some weight. Knowing how much I detest exercising I knew I needed to find something that I could stick with in order to achieve my goal of losing 40 pounds. I grew up in the 80s and was a video gamer through and through so when I saw there was a video game that included dancing and music, I had to try it. Just Dance 4 was the first one that I purchased. It was really great so after that I purchased Just Dance Greatest Hits, 2014, and 2015. In my opinion they are all great, some better than others. The songs are also great. You get a real mixture of genres so most everyone can find songs they enjoy dancing to. I just wish Nintendo would release more DLCs and more frequently. I was able to lose those forty pounds by last October and almost a year later have managed to keep it off and maintain using Just Dance and a balanced diet. I am so thankful for these games because if it hadn't been for them, this gamer would probably still be forty pounds heavier and vegging out in front of a different kind of video game. Thank you UBI Soft and Nintendo. I am including an after picture and a picture of all the clothes that I donated because they didn't fit anymore. Thanks to Just Dance and following a balanced diet (logging everything into the Lose it! app daily) I was able to lose the weight.  If you find my review helpful please let me know and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below and I will answer them as quickly as possible.   Thank you for checking out my review.   :)	2015-08-02

I have to say, I'm very happy with this case! It's the bright, cheerful shade of yellow that Rilakkuma is associated with and the images of Rilakkuma and friends are high quality and ridiculously cute, I absolutely love it. It's snaps on easily, it's sturdy and won't fall off the 3DS XL, and totally cute! For reference, 3DS XL and 3DS LL are the same thing, it's just that instead of calling it XL in Japan they call it LL. I totally recommend this cover if you love cute things like San-X's Rilakkuma.	2015-08-02

Just like in the previous Batman Arkham game series you can jump into street fights and do whatever, but in Origins the counter attack move performed on the easiest of thugs is flawed. I played the campaign on Normal difficulty and I was having difficulty with random groups of thugs that you must beat in order to proceed in the game. Needless to say, I, Batman, was beat up by rudimentary street punks. Although some had guns, riot shields, and some were brutes, I didn't have a problem at all beating them up in Arkham City and Asylum. I got extremely frustuated at the game and why I couldn't execute the counter attack on the easiest of criminals. I love the Arkham video game series but this one needs work.	2015-08-02

They told him they do not take these as trades since there is no way to test whether or not they worked. He asked me if I wanted them since he had no use for them. Since I was actually in the market for headsets for my PS4. I graciously accepted them. I found out later I only had to buy a ps3 controller charger cable to be able to charge them. He did include the blutooth part to put in the system. I found a cable for a good price. When I tested it I was amazed of how great of quality the sound sounded. It sounded like I was surrounded by speakers rather then the usual coming from the speakers in my tv. The cussions on the ear piece feel very soft so I am in a marathon of gaming or movie it wont bother me. I love the fact the mic is hidden so it wont get in the way. For the price it is worth it...though I only paid for the charger cable<br /><br />Pros:<br />-works on ps4<br />-amazing sound<br />-very conferrable	2015-08-02

There's many good things about this bag, and a few things that could be done much better. First off, let me say that it is not made explicitly for the Wii U. The Wii U and Gamepad are held in by velcro straps, meaning that they can be reasonably secure. Despite not being made for the Wii U, it makes up for it by having an incredible amount of storage space and plenty of different pouches for different applications. There's two pouches on the front, two pouches on the inside, and three slots for &#34;disks&#34;. Realistically, if you have very thin cases you can fit two or so games in there. Otherwise, I don't suggest using them. It also includes a shoulder strap, but I haven't used it much yet. When you get to it, it fits a ton of things, and one of them is a Wii U. If you need a case, this is probably your best bet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-You can fit a ton of different things in here.<br />-The gamepad and Wii U remain very secure despite not having specific slots.<br />-The case itself is pretty light, and the weight will depend entirely on what you put in there.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It's still not made explicitly for the Wii U.<br />-It looks pretty boring.<br />-The small game slots are not at all good for games.<br /><br />List of things I was able to fit in the case all at once:<br />-Wii U Console<br />-Wii U Gamepad in soft foam case<br />-Wii U Pro Controller<br />-Wii Controller with Nunchuk Attachment<br />-Gamecube Controller<br />-Wii U AC Adaptor<br />-Wii U Gamepad Charger<br />-Wii/Wii U Sensor Bar<br />-6 foot HDMI cable<br />-Wii U Gamecube Adaptor<br />-2.5&#34; Hard Drive Enclosure<br />-2 games in small cases<br />-2 games in full DVD cases	2015-08-02

Outstandingly engaging single-player rpg. Outstandingly engaging co-op. PvP is now obsolete for joy.	An excellent RPG.<br />pros - turn-based combat. Button-smashing (proc sequences, Wow/guild wars gamers you know what I'm talking about) repetitive, often only marginally conditionally dynamic patterns onto the numbers of your keyboard - this game removes that need. The walking-on-eggshells feeling of always swapping between auto-run and strafing keys (q, e in guild wars/wow) to approach fights while still having fingers keyed up to smash into those damaging sequences of abilities/spells is gone.<br /> pro - strategic turn-based combat<br />- accomplishment is real. The system of this game is intuitive, optimizing your use of it to have your characters triumph over enemies is intellectual rewarding.<br />pro - dynamic strategic turn-based combat<br />- Fighting a single boss from fighting enemies outnumbering oneselves twenty - to - five, and the continuous and surprising scaling between these extremes are as different as playing two separate games. The development of conditional strategies has far more depth than the &#34;mute or hamstring,&#34; single button interchanges that more basic rpgs offer (again, wow is alluded to.)<br />pro - customization<br />- Diablo 2 style character building. You may have two characters, or four, or in the well-implemented co-op, only one. This hinges upon using lone-wolf or not, a feat (think DnD, any edition) that can channel a balanced but complete amount of ability/attribution/stats that is by default spread across two characters into a single character. The development planning may be either serious or casual, depending on how you like your gaming. Challenging on standard difficulty.<br />pro - the feeling that any time not spent developing/optimizing characters may be spent developing/optimizing strategy instead, leading to, ultimately, similar feelings of gleeful, smart glory.<br />pro - modular/randomly generated loot. This is what it's all about, homies.	2015-08-02

I won't do my normal review. I am going to just squeeze in my thoughts about this game overall.<br /><br />The story is pretty deep and I like how there are factions that you come across. You play as 3 different characters starting from very humble beginnings to actually being a prince. I know I can write some spoilers as this game is old but I prefer to leave some things out in case people haven't played it yet. From that point on, whoever you choose, you start in different places on the map. This game really follows a Dungeons and Dragon approach to its style. There really isn't any exploration as it is not open world. It is more linear than anything else that allows you to see what is around you in a corridor. The way it leads up to the end is okay but there are some boss battles that you need to be well informed about before you battle them. But the way that Bioware brings the 3 kinds of races together is unique. I will say that even if you can figure out some of the story before the end, there are at least 3 big surprises that you don't see coming. And with them giving you the ability to make the choice in the first place, you will be engaged.<br /><br />For the combat of the game, I found it to be ultimately disappointing. I see why in the Dragon Age 2 they went with the action approach. This game, at least on console, gives you the impression that it is an action RPG when it plays similar to a real time combat RPG along the lines of Final Fantasy 13 but not as fast. Actually it was very similar to Knights of the Old Republic on the Original Xbox where you enter commands and it does what it's suppose to without you necessarily have to push a button. If you can take that, then you will get through the game.<br /><br />Overall, the game is playable but it wasn't my type of game. So if you are looking at my review, just know that it is not to be compared with modern games. This game came out in 2007 so its more than 7 years old. Graphically it's better looking than it's ps3 counterpart, but it looks horrendous. That is something that usually doesn't bother me but it will bother someone else according to today's standard of even good graphics. Play it to experience it but go in with the expectation that it might feel really archaic.	2015-08-02

I have been a big fan of both previous Witcher games, and I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical going in, mainly because of the big &#34;open world&#34; craze that overtaking the game industry these days. I personally loved the flow, and narrative of the previous games, and hoped that they weren't making an open world game purely for that sake of the large map, and the &#34;go anywhere, do anything&#34; angle purely because it is quickly becoming viewed as a necessity for a successful game these days. But after playing for roughly 40 hours or so, I can safely say that CD Projekt Red did a fantastic job keeping the game focused, but open, not simply because they just could do it, but because it genuinely works well with the progression of both main, and supporting characters. More often than not, I find myself playing through main story quests until I feel like there is something of value to be gained elsewhere. It could be more experience, equipment or gold, or even just revelations on supporting characters, or world lore, but this game managed to find the perfect balance between keeping a focused, story-driven adventure RPG, and an open world, free-form exploration action RPG. It never hurts to be skeptical, but its always nice to be proven wrong for a pleasant surprise. I have yet to see where the story will lead, but so far it has hooked me in completely, and I have no doubt it will end up being a great addition to the series.	2015-08-02

I was almost afraid as it if would break when I was adjusting it to my TV. It worked as expected and the side clips that clip right into the base of the Kinect was a nice touch to keep it from falling off. As in some other reviews, the back support arm did not seem to grip to the back of the TV very well. The part that touches the TV is simple plastic. No rubberized gripping at all. I thought that was strange for a &#34;holder&#34; and this is why I am giving this review only 4 stars. I ended up putting some self-adhesive rubber bumpers on it so that there would be more friction to hold the thing in place. Decent device for the price.	2015-08-02

It definitely works, and having the official branding is nice but other than that, I don't find that that fully justifies the difference in cost.<br /><br />TL;DR: I like it, I just can't love the price difference.	2015-08-02

The buttons had a habit of rapid firing on a single press..... Horrible for combos, and fatalities.<br />Conclusion :<br />I would recommend using your basic controller than spending money on this controller, shame as I was really excited for it.	2015-08-02

Affords a decent grip without being tacky, and doesn't have a bunch of grooves in it to pick up grime. Wiping it clean is easy. It fits my Japanese PS1 dualshock perfectly and adds a lot of size and bulk to the controller, which I like. It may look like a novelty or 'toy' sort of thing, but picking up a controller with one of these on it really lends the feel of picking up 'a piece of gaming equipment' instead of a bit of plastic. When you hold it in your hands, you won't want to chuck the controller down after playing, because you'll worry about it breaking something.   Do put the skin on carefully - it's easy to force the sticks while getting the skin into place over them.  I recommend this skin!  EDIT 11/13/16: I've been using this thing for years now and it still doesn't show any signs of wear. It adds so much comfort to the controller that a normal skinless controller feels strange to my hands now.	2015-08-02

I can hear very well using them but often I'm told people can't hear ME. I don't know where the mic is so I don't know if my long hair has anything to do with the problem.

I wish I can order more of them.<br /><br />Update: It lasted a year before breaking. The foams are still in great shape. They didn't chip at all. The piece of cloth inside the ear muff that covers the speakers has torn off though. There is some yellowing on the hard plastic parts of the muffs but I'm sure they could be cleaned.

Arrived on time, well half a year or so after its first launch date. I had hooed they spent that time making the game better, boy was I wrong. The main complaint I have is the batmobile, it has literally kept me from playing a game I waited forever for. If they would release a directors cut minis the batmobile it would be 5 stars. Instead of the ultimate batman game we got a crappy need for speed in a tank ripoff. The controls are horrible, its so hard to steer and manuever the thing its just not fun. And then there are all the puzzles that you have to use the batmobile to complete. Seriously you should have stuck to what made people actually like a superhero game and left out the crappy racing open world nonsense.	2015-08-02

It's why I play PC games, even emulators of other systems, all with my old PS1 Dualshock. Had and used this about 2 years without issue, and had one before that that lasted even longer before it got lost in a move. It's plug-and-play, does not introduce any significant input lag, and has worked with every PS1/PS2 controller I've plugged into it. This device and a Japanese Dualshock 1 are all you need to play most games on most emulated platforms, although you might have to remap controls for some of them. Analog movement works a treat. Ape Escape, a game known for its dependence on dual-stick use, and R4, a racer in which steering with the stick takes an expert's grace, are both perfectly playable using one of these. Of the games I play which have native gamepad support, most allow remapping. When they don't, you can use JoyToKey or similar to remap the buttons to keys and still play. As for emulating DirectInput with a setup like this, it's not worth the trouble IMO and you're better off with another device. But for everything else, this is as simple/inexpensive as 'good and functional' gets.	2015-08-02

Fantastic gamer. It has a bit of a learning curve and a few of the characters on your team are totally useless, but it is a good story, good game play, has a challenging difficulty curve, allows plenty of chances to grind/experiment in between the story, and the fusion and skill rack ability is a really fun mini-game that will really help your team.  Some of the characters are introduced poorly, but they grow on you. Someone really screwed up lo's chest; it looks so silly.  ADVICE: When asked to be a boy or a girl, pick the girl. It is not asking of your main character's gender. It is asking your computer's gender....yeah, I don't get it either, but hey! It's Japan.	2015-08-02

I have to say that I rarely like leaving negative reviews for decent games but this was not a good game. First the story.<br /><br />Story<br />I can't really say too many things about the story for the game because it wasn't that great. And don't get me wrong, Mario games aren't much better, but at least you get the gist of it. A princess in dire need for help and a plumber coming to the rescue. It doesn't have to really be like real life but at least something to get you through the game would be good. But in this game, you have the power of a beast in you for some reason and you end up in a town trying to figure out how to leave. You need to find rings in the world to help give you power ups for your beast form. You transform based on the moon if you travel at night. During your regular form you have to talk to villagers to get their problems solved which will help you to taking on missions in the world. The bad part is that most of the times you don't quite get who you should be talking to about missions and then you have drawn out conversations only to realize you are not talking to the right person. They don't do a good job of directing you either so many times you might just end up wandering around without a clue. The story is horrible for a Sonic game and now I see why people don't play Sonic games.<br /><br />Controls<br />They are completely wonky. Once you are in a mission, they are standard. I played with the classic remote because trying to use the Wiimote on this thing will make you want to break the tv. I don't know why they did that but the controls are extremely loose for the game meaning that you will find yourself looking like you are flying a spaceship using the Wiimote with the joystick connected. Upon using the classic remote, Sonics standard moves are the power ball (where he revs up into a little blue ball and bursts away), and jumping.Playing in the beast mode you have 2 attacks but it really doesn't matter because both attacks yield the same results.<br /><br />Overall<br />I can't even bring myself to keep talking about this game. Sega once stood for something. You see the inspiration in many of their old games. But this was a dud. I played Alpha Protocol which was extremely glitchy, but had an amazing story and only got better once you leveled your character up. This game was uninspired. It's like they churned this out knowing that people would purchase it on Sonics name. I hope future games will at least go in a different direction.	2015-08-02

And I have to say, Assassin's Creed: Unity is a great game... if you're into half of your missions being &#34;chase the man/woman around the streets of Paris.&#34;  Which, incidentally, is again hampered by the fact that the run button and the climb button are the same button, so if you get too close to a building, wall, or other object, you'll abandon said chase in order to start climbing.  Fun!  And, hey, if you're into a game series where its 8th major-release removes features that make you stealthy (like whistling while in hiding to attract enemies for the kill, or the ability to dispose of dead bodies) to make way for more poorly executed street brawling, then this is the game for you!  Because, clearly, to the developers of this game, &#34;stealth&#34; means &#34;fight in plain sight.&#34;  Want to fire a stealthy wrist-mounted arrow from the cover of a crowd and still be seen by enemies behind a wall with no direct line-of-sight?  AC: Unity has that feature!!!  Want to be hit by an enemy's sword because half of the time you don't get the on-screen prompt that he's attacking?  Then you should buy this game!  Want the most forgettable Romeo-&-Juliet-lite story starring two of the most unlikeable characters in an Assassin's Creed game yet?  THEN THIS IS YOUR GAME, MAN!  Want to skip the enhanced-for-this-entry grind of collecting in-game money to buy and upgrade your weapons, armor, and stealth tactics by spending actual, real-world cash on microtransactions (beyond the 60 bucks you already spent) to jump to the head of the class because getting there naturally has coincidentally become more tedious than ever before? THEN OH MY GOODNESS YOU NEED TO OWN THIS GAME, LIKE, YESTERDAY!!!<br /><br />Two stars because the only people not asleep at the wheel at Ubisoft for this vapid disaster are the ones who meticulously rendered late 18th-century Paris into a gorgeous, sprawling virtual landscape.  Kudos to those guys and gals.  Everyone else should be ashamed of themselves.ris into a gorgeous, sprawling virtual landscape.  Kudos to those guys and gals.

I am a huge Legend of Zelda fan and have been playing the games for years.  When Twilight Princess came out I was taken aback.  It was a change to the usual Zelda games I am used to.  It feels a little darker.  Link looks awesome in this game.  I love that you can change into a wolf too.  The thing I love the most about any Zelda game are the puzzles you must figure out.  Sometimes it takes awhile to figure out a solution and you may be about to pull your hair out and quit, but you don't.  You don't because you know you will get this and when you do how great you will feel at your success.  The graphics are amazing.  The songs are too as usual.	2015-08-02

They all ran pretty hot, and this little bugger is no exception. That's the main problem and concern people have. Sure it will take it's share of abuse, but I doubt nearly as good as the bigger system(s), That's the whole point. This is small, and convenient. I mainly got it for a few &#34;old&#34; games and DNLA content, mp4, avi etc. since I won't buy a PS4 till next year when the price drops and UC4 comes out. Same with the 360, though I'll probably never buy an Xbox One. This is still a great multimedia device, and with all the Samsung, LG, Phillips, and even Sony Streaming/DVD/Bluray devices on the market. It's just silly to pay that much for one of those when you can get this. With the 500gb of space, which you can actually use. Either for games, music, movies etc. Straight off of a flash drive. And never heave to plug anything in, because of the excellent streaming capabilities.  I hooked mine up, and right away the Playstation Store installation crashed the system. So I sighed for a moment and said well, I've seen them all do this, so no biggie. Also I got mine at Wal-Mart, so if i have to return it, no big deal. I use the 360 also for some multimedia stuff, but not much. Mostly old games. The top blu ray door doesn't bother me since my entertainment center is like a desk. Nothing closed in. And I rarely watch discs anyway. But nice to have just in case. I also like the fact that unlike the Roku, you can take this to someones house, have it loaded up with movies etc. and NOT have to have any type of internet connection to watch them. DLNA content of course. So it's very portable. Also being an older system, with all the new UI on it. It's pretty laggy, mostly on the PSN store. The home screen works pretty fluidly. So it's good for a 9 year old device, but that HEAT, with it's small size is my main concern. Though there is a lot of power (for it's time) under the hood for something this small. SoI'll use it, and see if it maintains itself well. Also PS4/Xbone just don't have enough content to justify a purchase at this time. Maybe 2016, Holiday season. We'll see. :)	2015-08-02

It would be a 5 star game but they took away features like career mode for example. Here are my pros and cons<br /><br />Pros:<br />1-Code masters new handling and physics engine is the closest thing they have had to a simulation type experience. It's not like a full blown sim like on PC but I enjoy the driving and got comfortable with the new engine after 4 full race weekends(hardcore racing gamer)<br />2- visuals are better than ever but I'm sure that in the future they will get better.<br />3- 2 seasons in one game is great for anyone smart enough to avoid 2014 as you get the 2014 and 2015 seasons in this game.<br />4- 1080p and 60 fps gameplay is a plus. It's much more enjoyable imo<br />5- smartest and most aggressive AI any codemasters game has ever seen. Be ready for quite a challenge on expert difficulty with no assist. It is an amazing experience. Drivers will attack you, make mistakes and defend their positions in a way that will intimidate you yet giving you a challenge at the same time.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1- lack of features such as career mode, season challenge, classic cars(but Codies have plan to bringing that back for the 2016 game as well as the other features that we all loved about previous entries)<br />2- bugs can affect your experience, such as random driver names appearing on screen, crashing, etc but I have only experienced the random names popping up glitch.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're a hardcore fan or a new fan to the sport and have a PC, ps4, or a Xbox 1 then you should consider the game. The driving for me is what made it worth it for me.	2015-08-02

I could not find this title or Exile for purchase digitally anywhere. I had to look for a physical copy. I bought the limited edition version which includes Revelations on 2 DVDs and Myst 3 Exile on one DVD, so it was a 3 DVD disc set. The box came in great condition, had everything inside it. The discs were in like new condition. The games installed fine on my Windows 7 64-bit PC, with no issues. Just put DVD in the drive and I selected full install option, Revelation took 8 GB of hard drive space, Exile a little over 2.<br /><br />A lot of users said you can't run these on Windows 7 64-bit, but I can say, both games play fine on my machine. You might need to change compatibility settings but they do run. My only complaint is Exile runs a little slow, every time you click, instead of instantly going there, the audio repeats or lags a bit, but other than that, that's it.<br /><br />Exile and Revelations are great games, amazing soundtracks, great story, and the visuals are fantastic. Revelations is more animated and life-like than Exile, but both are great in there own regard. I am so glad I found this great collection to finish off my Myst Series.	2015-08-02

With some minor mapping issues out of the way with the help of the poorly translated user guide, you will be enjoying yourself on the XBox360 with the best wheel on the market. Not the Microsoft has given any competitor to even come close.<br />If this is your first wheel, great, enjoy. Stop reading. However, if you came from using the first Microsoft Wireless Racing Wheel or have played the G27 on the Playstation you know what Force Feedback is supposed to be and using this won't give you that.  Force Feedback gives you a continually varying amount of input, depending on what is napping with the car.<br />Imagine your approaching a decreasing radius turn at speed. You begin to turn the wheel but obviously can't feel the amount of G-forces that are happening. Force Feedback supplies that input by gradually increasing the force it takes to continue turning the wheel as the G-forces increase.  Where this is especially important is when suddenly the wheel goes &#34;light&#34; or easy to turn. This means you've lost traction and you're headed for an important meeting with the outside wall. Newton, you fickle bitch. Having correct Force Feedback helps you run that ragged edge and makes the world on enjoying the simulated experience.<br />With the Maxrace Converter, your G27 thinks it's a handheld controller and the steering wheel is a thumb stick. It will provide even pressure that wants to self-center the wheel no matter what is happening in the game or how much you are turning the wheel. When you hit something or do anything where the handheld controller would vibrate, the wheel will wiggle back four or five times.<br />Bottom line is for what this module costs, you could get a good used Playstation 3 and a copy of Grand Turismo and skip the module entirely.	2015-08-02

There are two modes in this Monopoly-esque game: an easy mode that plays like Monopoly and is easy for all ages and a standard mode that allows players to buy and sell stocks, complicating their abilities to earn $$ and dominate other players.  Quite honestly, I learned a little about how stocks work playing this game!  The whole family enjoys this game but be forewarned: if Monopoly is one of those games that can get you really cranky if you're losing or turn you into a greedy megalomaniac if you're winning then use caution with whom you play!  (You can play solo, and there are tons of little things to unlock and collect.  It can be quite challenging.)<br /><br />The game uses a variety of characters from the Mario and DragonQuest games, or you can use your own Miis.  When you play solo there's a lot of dialogue from the characters and it really slows your game down.  Fortunately there are options to turn off the dialogue and to adjust the game's speed.  But the coolest features of this game are the variety of playing boards that are used.  Each have their own strengths and strategies.  All of the unlockable boards are worth unlocking (and this will take some time spent with the game doing so in a one player mode) especially the final board for the easy play games.  Finish 1st through 3rd (out of four players--the computer will fill in for any non-human player and you always have to play with four) and earn points to unlock different character movements and costumes (and there are a lot--I fell short of opening all but about 7).<br /><br />Games take about an hour to two to complete and there is a save feature so you can come back to a game that you're doing great on if you don't have time to finish it in one sitting.  Our family will be keeping this game as long as we keep our Wii.	2015-08-02

These are way too slow... Having to wait for 50 enemy units to move, EVERY TURN... especially rerunning those turns when you make a mistake... ouch!<br /><br />Using the DB was a bit of a pain as they are so much weaker than the rest of the teams... so getting back to them was harsh, yet interesting!<br />Unlike other Fire Emblem games I've played it prevents you from only playing with your favorite guys.<br /><br />It really felt more like a continuation of the previous game than a sequel (meaning the game is very much the same... only continuation of the story) and since I loved the previous one it was all good!<br /><br />SPOILER:<br />One thing I didn't enjoy at all, was hunting Laguz with the DB.

While Splatoon can be a really fun game, it has unfortunately been hijacked by increasing numbers of violent psychos whose only intention is to slaughter the opposing team in the shortest amount of time by playing dirty. Among other tactics they will surround the opposing team’s spawning area and kill them before they have a chance to fire off a single drop of paint. From what I’ve read these players tend to come from a particular country, and they have become the overwhelming majority in Splatoon now. Nintendo needs to change it so you can choose to play within your own country. My family has finally given the game away in disgust. It’s just no fun for us anymore. My daughter is 8 and has been a gamer since she was 4, but this game is terribly frustrating for her as she is constantly being killed. So if you’re thinking of buying this for your kids, know they will probably struggle with it until they turn 12 or so.	2015-08-02

I love PSP games and these were PLAYSTATION ONLY games.  On top of that, Clank is a GRATEST HITS and Daxter is a FAVIORTS game.  But they are bad.  I like games with a multiplayer support NOT because I like Call of Duty multiplayer but so I can play with my dad (who got me these games.). Daxter has multiplayer and its ad hoc.  But!!!  You have to do a PART of the singleplayer game to do the multiplayer as you have to unlock &#34;bugs.&#34; (See my review of Daxter.). Clank is fun.  Not.  Ripe off of James Bond, with little kid effects. (Although I am 12.)  as a total, 3 stars for both.  Gave to sister.	2015-08-02

The characters don't look smooth and sharp (they look better than the PSone and N64 versions). Too bad they couldn't invest more time and effort to prevent this errors from happening like with the Dreamcast version (Rayman 2 the great escape) which will always be the best version until the Rayman series dies.

With a brief bit of a tutorial on Youtube I was able to easily take apart the controller and install them. As a gaming enthusiast the stock plastic sticks' rubber grip had worn down to being smooth and kind of spongy, but I highly doubt that it'll be so easy to wear down aluminum. They fit great (you might have to press a bit, don't be afraid of using a little elbow, the controllers are more solidly built than they appear) and after a couple hours on the Witcher I've gotten used to the slightly different stick face. A brilliant upgrade- if I get a second controller, I'm getting a second set. If my first controller breaks, I'm harvesting the first pair to use in the replacement.<br /><br />The D-Pad is not metal, but plastic, and so I didn't fit it on my controller, but I'm certainly keeping it around. Never hurts to have a spare.	2015-08-02

I bought this for my son and after a few months,  one of the ports on the base (the one closest to the charging display) does not appear to charge.  Placing the controller on the port behaves normally at first.  After a few seconds, the red LED goes out and the controller icon just flashes.<br />Bad battery?  No.  you can place that same controller on the other port and it will continue to charge like normal.  If we place his second controller on the same port, the same thing happens again.  Place the second controller on the other port, it charges fine.  The issue follows the port on the base.<br />I have emailed Nyko, no response yet. I have searched the web for this issue, nothing.  I have tried to see if I could download the manual, nothing.  I found the original manual and it has nothing for troubleshooting other than to call a number during business hours (when I work) or their web address, which is where I left the email.<br />This is not looking good.  So although we can charge, we can only charge one station at a time.<br /><br />I will try and update this when I get a resolution or if I get any response from Nyko.	2015-08-02

I was a bit hesistant at first since I prefer HORI branded protectors but these look great, fit fine and applied easily.  I highly recommend you do any application such as this in the bathroom, less hair and dust to mess you up.  Turning on a hot shower will also add humidity to trap any particles in the air as well, seriously, it's science!  The included set of 'tools' to apply the protector were a nice touch too, and even if you screw up you have a few extras to fall back on.  No issue here though, it went on great the first time and I stored the others away.  Screen is clear and the anti-glare matte finish actually looks nice as well.<br /><br />Fast shipment, and even arrived on a Sunday no less.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2015-08-02

I love the SNES controller. I thought this would be the perfect thing to use to play emulators with between my phone, laptop, and desktop computers. For the first 2 hours I had the controller, I was so happy I found this thing. The build quality is fantastic and it pairs to all my devices in seconds!<br /><br />Then I waited a couple hours and tried pairing the controller again. All of a sudden it just doesn't want to work correctly. All my devices recognize it, and it does pair, but then it just doesn't work. My computer/phone will say that it's paired but the LED won't stay lit indicating that it is paired. I tried holding select to clear the pairing info, I tried every mode, clearing the pairing info between each try. I tried updating to the latest firmware. Nothing worked. The only way I can use this with bluetooth is to reset it to factory settings every time and even then it only works for a few hours. If you set the thing down for 10 minutes it goes into sleep mode, and during this time whatever happens to make the bluetooth not work anymore happens. So basically every time you want to use it you have to reset it completely.<br /><br />It works fine when you plug it in but it still goes into sleep mode, which makes no sense. If it's receiving power over USB then why on earth does it have to go to sleep after 10 minutes of no use.<br /><br />It's nothing but trouble, but when it works it's awesome. I hate it.	2015-08-02

The matchmaking system for quick match has a penchant for mirror matches which can be entertaining but often just bothersome; why have so many characters to just put like ones in the same game?  Hero league is better as it picks in the standard 1-2-2-2-2-1 format but the ranking system means you can rise and fall quite quickly based on the match participants and doesn't necessarily reflect true skill.<br /><br />I love the characters and variety of maps and characters.	2015-08-02

Plug and play away.	Does it a feel a little light?  Sure.  Is it weird that the rumble port is there despite the fact that it doesn't actually work with rumble packs?  Yeah, a little.<br /><br />But otherwise, these things work flawlessly.  The joystick maybe has a slightly different feel than the original (hard to remember), but it still works great.  I bought 2 and my roommate liked them so much, he also bought two.<br /><br />Plug-and-play functionality.  Just set the buttons on whatever you're playing, and you're ready.  A quick note: if you're using MotionJoy's PS3 controller program on your computer, that will block these from working.  You'll need to uninstall the drivers for that and then plug these back in.<br /><br />Also, additional recommendation.  Get a 4-port USB hub and a USB extender so you can sit away from your computer and enjoy four players.	2015-08-02

And this is a safer way to pay for your subscription.	Be sure to order this with 2 weeks out from your time running out in case there is a problem with the shipping of this time card. Although I had problems with my Order coming out of Oakland California, this product is best if you buy the ONLINE CODE because you get it right away. However if you can only pay by a check this is your only option. Now bear in mind this is a time card not a bonus code or Collector edition code. This product does as it advertises and gives you 60 days. Plus be careful if you are going to stack these codes you can only prepay for 6 months (180 days) so if you buy 3 of these and you have time left use 1 of the codes and look at the days left if you have less than 120 or less days then you can add the 3rd one. But the max is 180 days do not put the 3rd code on until you are 120 days or less out from the end of the prepaid time.<br /><br />In addition, you now get veteran rewards by the total days subscribed not time played. So if you are a new player and you add 2 cards you will get the rewards for those days Ranks 1 2 and 3 for the first 120 days the next card you put on will give you the 180 days (Rank 4) rewards the 270 day reward (rank 5) rewards will come on after the next 2 cards are added When I add this code I will be 30 days shy of rank 5 and I cannot add another code for a bit because I will have around 127 days left so I have to wait until I am 120 or less to add the next code.<br /><br />This is the SAFEST way to play because with all the websites being hacked having your credit card information on your account isn't safe with the fact that places like SONY has proven that. And this is also a good way to give a gift code to a friend/family member who plays.	2015-08-02

I wanted a Just Dance game for my Wii and I picked this one because it was less expensive than the others.  I’ve had a lot of fun playing this game!  I find it’s difficult to get a high score, but I’m not sure if it’s because I’m uncoordinated or because the motion tracking isn’t great.  I don’t really pay much attention to the score though, since I’m just playing to get myself moving and have a good time!<br /><br />I think the song selection is great, and there really is something for everyone.  The dances are fun and there seems to be something for every level of dancer.  I play mostly by myself, but occasionally my husband will play.  I admit he’s not a big fan because he feels like he isn’t good at it.  If you’re a little self conscious and won’t enjoy yourself if you feel like you aren’t getting every move, you may not like this game.  I’ve played with my mom and my sister as well, and we have a blast!<br /><br />I feel like the menus are a little tedious to scroll through, but it’s not too bad.  I’m also not a big fan of the sweat mode - I’d like to have an exercise mode that goes directly from one song to the next without me having to push any buttons. However, I don’t know if this game doesn’t have it or I just haven’t figured out how to make it work.  Honestly I haven’t spent much time trying to figure it out since I have other exercise games that work exactly how I want without my having to think too hard :)<br /><br />Overall I recommend this game - it’s fun to play alone, and I think it would be even more fun to play with friends - just as long as everyone has a carefree attitude about it.	2015-08-02

The Hayabusa stick is a little more loose than the Sanwa sticks in most sticks. On the other hand the Kuro buttons take a little more pressure than a Sanwa OBSF. If you have used a madcatz TE stick they use Sanwa parts. The parts overall are much much more quiet than non silent buttons. I am able to play in a 3 bedroom apartment at 3am without waking anyone up!<br /><br /> The chassis is made of hard sturdy plastic which ends up making the stick quite light. I could see some people who play with their stick vigorously have slipping issues although i have had none. The stick worked right out of the box with my pc and Windows 10. The most important decision would be if you like a looser stick. If possible play on a fightstick with a Sanwa installed and try to imagine it a little bit looser. Overall i am very happy with my purchase.	2015-08-02

The big surprise was the rod and reel feel, just like the real thing!  This will be a favorite for my husband since outdoor fishing is no longer an option.	2015-08-02

I bought this mouse a year and a half ago and it's still going strong! I've put it through hours of torture with League of Legends and my Obsessive Clicking Syndrome. The weighting is a pretty cool feature and is noticeable if you're playing for hours on end like I end up doing fairly often. The mouse is also large and fits well in my very big hands, a trait that I have found in few lower priced mice. I have traveled with and put this guy through hell and it still sits on my desk and takes the load I put on it!<br /><br />This is a must buy for budget gamers and even just for people that want a larger mouse!	2015-08-02

He has always been fascinated with farming equipment and this game has brought them to life for him. Now since he is young he doesn't play the game to its fullest with the the missions or real farm building. My son loves to maneuver the trucks and other equipment around and is slowly figuring out more and more of the game. There is some reading required about how to work machines and so forth that he needs help with but he loves it. The animation is amazing and very realistic. The game actually uses a new visual technology called PBR, or physically-based rendering. The technology helps to produce a photorealistic rendering by simulating how the light behaves on materials like metal, plastic, glass and more.<br /><br />A new activity that is in this game is Woodcutting. This is my son's favorite activity. Every time I catch him playing the game he is woodcutting. There are numerous vehicles and machines to woodcut including tree cutters, chainsaws, chippers, trailers and tools for harvesting. Players can sell the wood them cut or process them at the sawmill.  Yes you do earn money in the game and that is how you buy more machines and such. There are various jobs on the farm that need to be done and players need to figure out which machines will get the job done and how to use them efficiently.<br /><br />This game really has so much packed into it to play and explore. My son loves maneuvering the different machines and seeing how they work. It is teaching him problem solving, decision making and budgeting money. He has learned that he doesn't have an endless supply of money so he has learned to earn money and spend it wisely.<br /><br />So with Farming Simulator 2015 you can now play online with friends in multiplayer mode. We haven't tried this yet but its great that its included for those that do like the online option.<br /><br />Overall though, Farming Simulator 2015 has become a family favorite between my sons and husband. My boys even like just watching my husband play with the different machines while they cheer him on.even like just watching my husband play with the different machines while they cheer him on.	2015-08-02

I mean in SD people have some real reasons to join our team (well most of them.. some just like the girl in our team..), but in this one it's only because we're doing good in training?!? (And since we're in the lower level then... we should be nowhere near the level of these guys that fought in the SD war...). The story was weaker than SD, but the gameplay was a bit better (and the arena was cool, though maybe making it too easy?).<br />So a good game, but because of its weak story it feels more like a game made purely for cash than a needed sequel.	2015-08-02

The thing is I hate the 2K and EA Sports video games because I don't have the coordination for it.  I wish I did, but the basketball game from 2K and EA is just to complicated.

Boy was I surprised as it turns out to ASS'U'ME really does make an ASS out of YOU and ME. When I read on the cover &#34;Hunger is a constant threat!&#34; I thought to myself &#34;I suppose that I must eat food in the game to play.&#34; What a joke... What it really means is that the second the plane hits the ground about 45 Ravenous wolves attack you mercilessly  Jumping from the wreckage of the plane as if they were cargo, but thats not all. Aside from the Bears being so &#34;HUNGRY&#34; that they decided to start &#34;Hunting&#34; in obscenely large wolf packs with mountain lions, the ASS over head drops of the Moose/Caribu/Goat in their fixed galleries were absolutely pathetic. When I paid money for an artificial existence called &#34;SURVIVAL&#34; I was not expecting to determine how much inexpendable ammunition I could dump across an Alaskan range the resembles the &#34;Prince of Persia the Two Thrones&#34; with a different skin from X-Box original just not put together quiet as well. Although the game is an excellent depiction of Activision's understanding of &#34;SURVIVAL&#34; in any form, I did not enjoy their ignorance to detail.  -Zane Russell Aston	2015-08-02

I like it better than frozen, but no.  N-O= NO!!!!!!!!  I hate this game.  It's crap.  Who ever made the characters MUST have been drunk and half asleep.  They should have been fired and had someone else make the characters.  (They look like bunnies.  They are humans with bunny ears. WHAT THE (BBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLEEEEPPPPPP).?!?). The plot is also BAD. Bugs take over the world and some sort of animal has to stop them?  (BBBBLLLLLEEEEEEPPPPP!).  So I thought &#34;Why not try Bug Combat?&#34;  Well, FIRST, you have to UNLOCK a bug.  That means if your little brother/sister has this game and they want to play with you (this didn't happen to me.), you have to play through like, the first 15 LEVELS!!!!! You get bugs by bug tokens.  Like I said, the plot is bad.  Bugs take over and you (Daxter) has to stop them ALONE!  Why can't the humans STEP ON THEM? Do they have no feet?  A really BAD game.  I can't even STAND BUG COMBAT!!!!	2015-08-02

Well, this case did great, except it can not withstand being ran over by a semi truck at 75MPH. Unfortunately, I did something very stupid, and left my Vita on the top of my car in this case.  The case did it's job, and actually stayed on the roof of my car until I got to the freeway - that's when I saw the case in my rear view mirror, go flying off the roof.  The case actually stayed closed, and I'm guessing the Vita was okay at this point.  That's when the semi truck ran it over... I had already began pulling over to the side of the road and backing up, but the pieces I found were barely a Vita anymore.  I was able to find both the back and front of the case, the screen of the Vita, most of its components, and the memory card.<br />There was a nice tire mark on the Vita's screen, which kind of felt like salt on the wound.<br /><br />I do recommend this case for the original Vita's though, it does great.	2015-08-02

It just has special thing about it... a thing only Nintendo knows how to do. It has great characters/design, bright ideas but with a small dark background if you pay attention and its just unique. I think ALOT of people should try it out. When I saw the e3 trailer, I didn't really like it.. I thought it would be another side game nobody notices, but as I started to see fanart, more trailers and just reviews, I decided to watch a few gameplay videos. After it seemed, kinda fun, I bought it and it is my new favorite game. I think this is a really great IP and Nintendo should be proud of making this. I love everything about it. If ANYONE thinks this game is bad, look up some OSTs or fabart and I'm sure you'll be enamoured by at least one.	2015-08-02

But if you're like me, and have only played the very first Tomb Raider game (or none at all), then it might take you awhile to get into. Overall, this is a great collection of great games. The only negative thing I have to say about it, is that it is extremely challenging. What I mean is, the games are basically one giant (complex) puzzle. There are no indicators or directions of any kind on what to do--you have to figure everything out yourself. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind challenging games--to an extent. There were times when I became frustrated due to the fact that I didn't know what the heck I was supposed to do. It's all trial and error. On the other hand, that is also what makes this game unique (and why I kept playing it).<br />So bottom line, you want to something that's going to rack your brain, or if you just want to take a trip down memory lane, then play these games. Just be prepared for some rough times ahead.	2015-08-02

I've read some of the other reviews about this game, and for the most part, they are very well stated and true. So to me, it would be kind of redundant if I reiterate what was already said. Instead, what I'll do is talk about the Batmobile. And the reason for that is because everything else in the game is very similar to the previous titles (aside from the outstanding graphics), which is not a bad thing, as said in another review.<br /><br />Obviously, the Batmobile is the main attraction of this game, considering it wasn't in the previous installments. That being said, is the Batmobile essential? Was it really necessary for Rocksteady to include this behemoth of a vehicle? Would the game have still been enjoyable without it? These are the questions I pondered as I began my &#34;final&#34; journey as the Batman. And to be honest, it's kind of a love/hate relationship. There were times when I enjoyed racing through the muddy streets of Gotham, or blowing up cars in a thrilling car chase. And then...there were the other times. When the game forced me to maneuver the Batmobile on a very awkward platform, or the tedious tank battles that became more annoying than enjoyable. But hey, these are my opinions. I know other people absolutely love the Batmobile, and that's perfectly fine. I still believe that despite it, it is much faster traversing through Gotham the old fashion way--gliding. And I do enjoy being shot out of the Batmobile like a rocket.<br /><br />Overall, the Batmobile is cool and all, but isn't necessary, until the game forces you to use it.	2015-08-02

While I rarely feel strongly enough about a game or item to review it...this was one of those games. Coupled with an unimaginative and plot-less story, you never gain any attachment to the characters in the game outside of the frustration of running up 1 flight of stairs and then huffing and puffing till death. The games atmosphere is by far the best thing about it. The gritty, dark and blood soaked world really does look amazing. But thats where the praise stops. It does a good job of making you want to play through the game for the sheer reason of not wanting to feel like you wasted your money. And thats how I spend my entire 16 begrudging hours in this campaign. The feelings of dissatisfaction being all the way back in chapter 3 with your first boss encounter. Filling the chainsaw toting lunatic with 8 explosive bolts and 4 shotgun rounds to the face and watching him still chase you all over the map knowing full well you have no more ammunition to fight with turns this game of cat and mouse into an hour long circle using the various traps to finish him off. It never really gets any better with the sheer assault of bosses from that point on. This game very quickly departs from a survival game in the sense of wits and becomes a survival game of &#34;run away because we're throwing another boss you need 30 rounds to kill and we've only given you 12&#34;. Over and over this repeats itself. If you must play it...I suggest stopping after each of its 15 chapters. This was NOT a return to the horror survival genre with its artificial difficulty and lack of any real scares. The only thing I ever feared in this game was repeating any of the long boring boss fights.<br /><br />For the record I REALLY wanted to love this game. Maybe that want is what forced me to complete it. But if it wasnt, and the want to feel like I didnt waste my money on it was my primary goal...I failed in that. I still feel like I wasted my money and my time with this game. At this point I feel thisgame has caused me to give up on Survival Horror games. They just simply arent any good anymore.	2015-08-02

I wasn't impressed right off with the cardboard sleeve the game came in, but I overlooked that. What through me was the extremely long wait time to actually update the game before I could play it. And the gameplay isn't anywhere as good as the Forza series. The main menus are a cluttered mess and, overall, is just confusing to navigate and play.  I'm not saying it's a bad game, but Forza 3 is a much better game.	2015-08-02

The missing parts included ALL OF THE CORDS necessary to make the thing work. Being an older model, I could find the stuff anywhere and had to beg for old pieces from friends.

Make sure to turn off fan when not in use.	When I ordered this, I was concerned it wouldn't fit on our shelf which is 12&#34; tall. Our PS4 was stored horizontally prior. This fit! It's about 11.25&#34; tall with the PS4 on it, but I'd recommend a 12&#34; space.<br /><br />I love that there's a fan to keep it cool. If you put the USB connection in the front, that allows you to plug it into the front USB port. Our PS4 doesn't have any spare USB ports on the back.<br /><br />There's a switch to turn off the fan... You will want to do this if you leave PS4 in standby mode, otherwise it will keep running and drawing energy. I don't believe it will turn off on its own once PS4 is cool- that would be a nice feature to have.<br /><br />The controllers plug in on each side... I love having a spot for the controllers so they will always be charged. The controllers plug in via the port on the bottom of them so if you have a battery back hooked on there like I did, it won't fit. That said, I may not need the battery pack if we put back the controllers every time. Hooking the controllers in takes some focus at first... It's hard to get them just right (particularly as the space is tight on my shelf). They go in at a weird angle. My son (3.5 years old) cannot put them back correctly by himself.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this product and it looks sharp.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this free in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-02
