Beauty	5	4	4	N	N	Has the warm sweet-spicy scent of my Grandmother's kitchen on Christmas Eve, love this!	If you put a pumpkin pie in the oven, steeped a high-quality Chai tea in a cup of hot water, and two of your best friends in the whole world showed up at your door with overflowing bags of gifts for you (and your house was spotlessly clean and the kids and spouse were at a very responsible relative’s home), this oil is what that would smell like. This Plant Therapy Allspice Essential Oil is the scent of my grandmother’s kitchen when I walked in on Christmas Eve. I love the warm sweet-spicy pie-in-the-oven scent.  I’ve just started making Christmas gifts, found these delightfully unusual antique inkwell bottles and am making seasonal reed diffusers with almond oil, a little rubbing alcohol (to help the reeds wick the scent) and few drops of Allspice Essential Oil. This is a great gift to give at those parties that are held early in the season: the reed diffuser lasts a long time. I received the Plant Therapy Allspice Essential Oil at a promotional cost for evaluation and review. Love the quality of this brand and love this nostalgic, warm -spicy scent!	2015-08-02

Works like a charm!	This Professional Blackhead and Acne Remover Kit is made of surgical stainless steel; which means it is built to last. This kit contains 5 different double sided extractors all targeted on specifically removing different sized and hard-to-reach impurities such as blemishes, blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples. The kit also comes with a plastic pouch for easy storage. The extractors are easy to use and the textured handles provide an anti-slip grip, comfort and precision when extracting whiteheads, blackheads or blemishes. I rarely have acne, whitehead or blackheads, but when they pop up I like to take action in removing them asap!<br /><br />I have a tool similar to these, but I really like the fact that the kit comes with different tips. I especially like the needle point tip. Makes it really easy to remove the stubborn ones. After use I like to rub them down with a cotton ball that I soaked with rubbing alcohol.<br /><br />I’m happy with the Blackhead and Acne Remover Kit. I would definitely recommend and would purchase it again.<br />**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes.

I am on an antibiotic but it still isn't keeping it at bay :( Anyways I have super dry skin when I don't moisturize and oily when I do and most every moisturizer breaks me out eventually. It was hard at first getting over the stigma of putting oil on my face but let me tell you this stuff is amazing!! Truly!! I never break out from it.

I've been suffering with this current round of eczema for many months now, and it's irritating, sore and I want it gone.

So I was hoping this would work and since it's all natural ingredients I feel much better about using it.

UPDATE on 9-13-15 Have seen no change for the better whatsoever since starting treatment with this product and am so disappointed, especially because this product received such high ratings by the reviewers.

When looking for essential oils, Moroccan Argan oil is one of the oils that you see for its multitude of uses and benefits (if you were like me and didn't know what to use it for here are a few areas:)<br /><br />• Protect against and heal skin infections<br />• Clear up acne<br />• Ease eczema<br />• Hasten recovery from chicken pox<br />• Heal cracks and burns<br />and it smells better than tea tree oil (but that's personal preference).  I use it for my skin (to keep it moisturized and protect it from the sun and the back of my heels and feet, which due to hypothyroid are cracked and dry.<br /><br />What I liked about the Aviano Botanicals argan oil:<br />1)It is USDA Certified and 100% Pure and Organic - No fillers, no chemicals<br />2) It comes in a dark bottle and includes a dispenser cap separately (see pictures)<br />3) It is fast absorbing leaving your hands and feet feeling smooth and not greasy once it dries up.<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for my opinion and it is what I have provided.

So after much research on Amazon I decided to buy Nourish Vitamins hair growth support SHAMPOO......its been 3 and a half weeks that I am using this shampoo and I thought I would write my review today.  My hair has been excessively falling for the past 1 year so I started my pursuit of addressing the issue of my hair loss and tried everything that anybody suggested....this is the ninth product/treatment that I started so you can well imagine how much research I must have done!  Needless to say when everything else failed, with no optimism left, I started to use this shampoo and I was washing my hair with it every other day and to my utter astonishment I started to see less hair fall...so I also decided to start the Nourish hair growth support VITAMINS, as I wanted to treat my hair loss problem inside and out.<br />Well about 3 + weeks after I can surely say that I am seeing less and less hair fall, which is a big deal for me, as anyone who is loosing hair knows how much it hurts to see your hair on the comb and on the pillow case!!  So this morning when I was combing my hair I only saw about 4-5 strands come out and that for me is a huge difference from before.  I am very happy and relieved to find a product that is finally working out for me!  These products have given me hope that I also can transform my falling, fine hair to healthy, strong hair!<br />I am also going to write another review in a month to tell you guys how my hair are doing and if I have seen any new growth as it is still early to comment on that.<br />I would highly recommend this combination of Nourish Shampoo and Vitamins to anyone who is loosing hair.....<br />Thank you Nourish!!	2015-08-02

You can either mist water on the pillow and heat it up in the microwave, or put it in the freezer for a few hours.

I received it as a gift. I had asked for bars of glycerine soap after having bought some fancier glycerine soap bars at a specialty soap store. I loved how those other bars cleaned well and moisturized my skin without harsh chemicals, but I couldn't afford to keep paying $6 or $7 per bar. I was excited to receive a six-pack of Clearly Natural unscented glycerin soap bars as a gift, thinking they'd be similar to what I previously had purchased for myself, but I'm finding that's not the case at all. Mostly, I'm frustrated by how little cleaning power these bars seem to have. They do not suds up, as other reviewers have commented, and some think that's a good thing, while others seem disappointed as I am. Even if suds aren't necessary for cleaning, as one reviewer claims, these bars don't seem to offer whatever else is necessary for sustained or economical cleaning either. When I rub them vigorously on my wash cloth, it still feels like almost no cleaning agent is on the cloth, and I end up rubbing a wet, not-soapy cloth on my body. The bar diminishes in size, but I don't feel as though I'm getting clean. I eventually moved a bar from my shower to the bathroom sink, on the theory that rubbing the bar directly on my hands will transfer more soap to the body rather than using a wash cloth as a cleaning medium. It seems this soap is better used as a sink bar than as a bath bar, but I'm still disappointed, because that's not what I was looking for.	2015-08-02

So, I went into this knowing I had sensitive skin but willing to try something new as I have used similar products before. Man do I regret that. I think I  have chemical burns under my arms and the fragrance is haunting my nostrils. Within seconds of my first application my underarms started to burn, which I thought would pass...but it didn't. I ended up running into my bathroom to take a shower to remove the, as promised, already dry &#34;fast drying&#34; gel. That part they didn't lie about, I think this stuff dried in seconds and merged with the cells in my armpits! I ended up washing under my arms several times with soothing body wash until at least the immediate burn was gone. However, even after 3 washes I still reeked of the fragrance of this deodorant. While I am pretty sure I removed all of the actual product it seemed to have tattooed me with its smell, even lingering into the next day....which I guess was the one part of this product that really did &#34;outlast&#34; my expectations. I am not sure if it is just my sensitive skin that caused the painful reaction or if this product works by scarring your sweat glands so badly you cannot sweat anymore, but either way I am not into that sorta &#34;beauty is pain&#34; mentality so this is a giant NO for me. The fragrance however was nice, just really overpowering and didn't go away. No way could I have worn my own perfume with this without a major clashing of smells. Secret really needs to make their products gentler and pull back a little on the &#34;french shower&#34; methodology of odor control...smelling like perfume with an undertone of B.O is still smelling like B.O, so really no need for that level of fragrance! I did receive this item for free from Secret to review, but all opinions are my own honest opinions.	2015-08-02

I used this shampoo for more than a year, twice or thrice a week. I can't say if it grew any new hair but it appeared to be helpful. I was using rogaine before but at least I stopped using that and start this shampoo. Again I can't really compare but I guess as long as I was doing 'something' about the problem, I was sort of content and I felt this was the better solution.<br /><br />Howe recently I got an ear infection. My ear started to pain. i went to see doctor and when he saw my ear he jumped out of his feet it was that bad. He asked if I had been to swimming pool where I could have gotten this which I didn't. When the doctor went away, he send in a nurse to check my ear just for her see how this infection looks when its in most 'severe' condition. He said they get patients but very rare to see at this level. I feel like it got developed in a span of a week where I started to feel discomfort in ear. It felt like water had gone down it in shower but the feeling was not going away until I started using the drops doctor gave me which fixed it.<br /><br />I figured it was due to this shampoo.

But it does not seem this new formula was ever tested by real people, real consumers who currently used the product.  What a mistake, further more the manufacturer surely did not test the formula in the exact bottle for distribution......it does not even squeeze out of the dispenser top.  I had to squeeze the bottle so tightly it cracked.  then on top of this mess had to use the cream in some fashion as I was traveling...so had to wrap it in blastocyst and use a cotton swab to retrieve it from the bottle to use.  Will not ever be buying from this company again.....loss of a 15 year customer for them.  many other organically on the market with same features, price and far better quality now.	2015-08-02

I will never go back to using regular deodorant or antiperspirant again. This stuff is clear and will not show up on your clothes. Ever. Although it doesn't keep you from sweating (which is fine with me), it does a pretty good job of keeping you from smelling. There have been a couple of days where I could catch a whiff of myself, but I blame that on the NC summer heat. I've been using the crystal for a few months now and I'm only halfway through it. I will say that since its used with water, the crystal has shrunk a little and falls out of the container. But as long as you know this, you can hold it in when applying to prevent that from happening. I will definitely continue to use this deodorant!	2015-08-02

The product does work, but it is so temporary that I wouldn't rely on it if I were going out. I applied under my eyes, and it did  magically and dramatically reduce the puffiness, lines and wrinkles; however, it only lasted for a few minutes. It probably would work best for someone with very fine lines. For me, it was an opportunity to see how I could look if I went under the knife:)  Also, even if it did last longer, you can't put make-up over it because the oils in it would negate the tightening effect. If the product does work for you, I would suggest that you use a pin to poke a tiny hole in the top, rather than cutting or tearing the packet opened; then when finished using, fold the top over and use a paper clip or clip binder to pinch it. That way, it is less likely to dry out.	2015-08-02

Which of course as some one who's not even 30 this was not setting ok so when I got a free offer from Crest and bzzagent to try this product for free I was so excited. I feel I should say I've tried I think about every form of whitening in the past and while they do work they all have their pluses and minuses. The strips are hard to stick perfectly on your teeth so you don't get your gums causing sores but you need to get all the tooth, not to mention your trying to obtain perfection on a wet surface. Then comes the removal of the strip it leaves this slimy film. Then comes whitening pastes and mouthwashes one they usually taste TERRIBLE and don't seem to yield results very fast, until Crest 3D white brilliance. It's an easy two step process 1) brush with the provided toothpaste for 1 minute 2) brush with the whitener for a minute, that's it.

I decided to buy this product because I have heard positive words and wanted to try for myself. I purchased at a discount in exchange for an honest opinion review. I am an Elizabeth Arden fan and this skin care fortifying capsules are a must ! Applied on my face and neck my skin feel very smooth, soft and absorbs quickly with no greasy feel afterwards. I am applying daily to maintain supple skin. I am seeing results in a matter of a few days. Not disappointed! Anyone looking for a nourish treatment for daily skin health, this is a must have !! Very satisfied and will certainly purchase again. UPDATE : I am now a week or so into using this product and changing my review....the capsules have expired or something because the product is darker in color now and leaves a light brownish tinge to my face. They also smell different. These are stored in my spare bathroom where no one showers or bathes so temperature doesn't key in, and I have central air so consistent temperature in that room. I have no idea what went wrong.	2015-08-02

To give a little background on my hair first: ever since puberty hit, I've had very oily hair. I HAVE to wash my hair everyday. Within 24 hours, my hair is all oily and gross. I've tried maybe a few different kinds of shampoo in the hopes of fixing it, but they were all drying type of shampoos that think if you strip your hair of all oils that it goes away, and it just makes it worst.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the review: I bought this shampoo around 2 weeks ago or so. It is summer here, in NC, and I also live near the coast, so the humidity is horrible. I sweat a lot, and when I wipe my face, it tends to get in my hair, which overtime gives the effect of greasy hair. That being said, I obviously haven't tried this shampoo out when I'm not sweating a lot, so that may have some effect on how it's working with my oil issues. It doesn't or hasn't so far, made me be able to go a second day without washing my hair. As I sit here and type this, my hair is all oily and gross, but I washed my hair at 5:30 am yesterday morning, and I did sweat a lot yesterday.<br /><br />I will say, however that it does get your hair squeaky clean. You can hear it squeak in the shower. I have hair down to my elbows and you only need a quarter sized amount to wash your hair. You only need to wash your scalp, not the rest of your hair. Everytime I get in the shower and squirt the quarter sized amount in my hair, I always think &#34;I need more.&#34; I just take a little on my finger tips and start massaging it on various parts of my hair. I scrub the back of my head towards my neck, cause it gets really itchy if I don't wash it everyday. This shampoo lathers so good.<br /><br />I read another review on here about how a lady who had horrible cystic acne would use it as face wash as well. I've been doing that too, seeing as how I have an oily face too. It hasn't changed anything with that yet either, except that if I do have any acne come up, it heals it a lot faster.<br /><br />I mainly got thisshampoo because it is silicone and sulfate free. I saw a girl on youtube talk about how silicone weighs your hair down and essentially creates frizz. I have frizzy curly hair, and wanted to see if it helped. I haven't been able to wear my hair down yet straight from the shower to see if it helps, but I can see a difference when I take my hair down in the mornings before I wash it.<br /><br />I follow this shampoo with the Silk 18, and I will say this: the conditioner smells amazing. I tell my friends that it smells like the good vanilla, not the nasty car air freshener vanilla.<br /><br />I'm thinking that maybe I just need to wait until fall/autumn is here, when I don't sweat as much, and I've really had the chance to see if it works like it's supposed to, maybe my sebaceous gland needs more repair than normal?

I’ve just started making Christmas gifts, found these gorgeous little spray bottles and am making air fresheners by mixing 1 cup of bottled water, a quarter cup of vodka, and then topping it off with ten drops of Holiday Season Essential Oil (shake before using to reblend the scent).

I decided to try this line of products when my old skin care products became too expensive for me. Unfortunately these products wrecked my skin in a matter of days. I went ahead and used the two week trial and repurchased it again (I know I am so smart) too see if my skin would adjust. After a month my skin was breaking out with painful cystic acne and well as covered in new red scars. Needless to say I bit the bullet and repurchased my old skin care products. Sometimes it's worth it to spend more on your skin care. You save money on foundation and concealer...	2015-08-02

Love, love and love this little brush set. The brush set came in a black nylon bag, sort of basic, but the products inside are anything but basic. The brush set included 4 brushes:<br />1) blush brush<br />2)angled blending brush<br />3)large eye shadow brush<br />4)small brush<br />made from pony and goat hair. Very soft to the touch.<br />The blush is a beautiful color called &#34;Peach belleni&#34; and is very complimenting of my medium complexion (tan) however, would look good on almost any skin tone<br />Inside I found a duo eye shadow, called Costa Rico and Miami, both are neutral palettes and have a hint of shimmer to both.<br />Lastly, inside this little token of happiness, I found a eye pencil with a built in sharpener in the lid. This is very important, as nothing is more irritating than not finding your sharpener while applying your make up.<br />So while I did receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I must report that this purchase was worth the full cost of what the seller is asking. It is a great package to throw in your bag and can touch up the necessary during your busy day!	2015-08-02

I have used other dark spot corrector serums which have stung, or caused a tingling.  Happily to report, this one does not bother my skin, and I've had no adverse reaction.<br /><br />It leaves my skin feeling baby-skin soft, and smooth like vanilla ice cream. Additionally, it doesn't have a heavy, thick feel to it at all.  I am very pleased with the results!<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with its primary ingredient, Kojic Acid, it is a remedy for the treatment of pigment problems, and age spots. Discovered in 1989, kojic acid works similarly to hydroquinone.

These stand out because they are larger than many other brands. My pet peeve with facial cloths are they always seem to be so small. These are of fairly good size. They are soft but also have just a bit of texture so you fell like your face is getting clean. There is really not much of a scent, so it will not interfere with any other scented products you want to use, or if you have sensitivity to scents, you probably would not be bothered. The exfoliating type made my face feel a slight burning sensation after I used it. I supposed this was the &#34;active ingredient' going to work to exfoliate, so I felt like it must be working. I just rinsed my face off afterward and if felt fine.  Burts Bees makes great products and these cleansing cloths are my new favorite.	2015-08-02

I also have sensitive skin.  I purchased a different LAVO product for my daughter (who has oily skin) and shipped it to her at college.  She was so happy with it that I thought I would try one too.  This cleans my skin without drying.  To use, I just clean my skin before with a facial wipe, put on the mask as directed in a thin layer and leave it until it starts cracking and then after removing the mask I use an oil free moisturizer.  After using the mask my skin feels tighter and toned.  I use it as recommended, twice a week.	2015-08-02

I even used the neutral without any color to make shine and improve hair. I've used black, auburn, chestnut, brown and red. I recently learned that gray hair has to be double processed using red first then the color you want. Also learned how to combine colors so the henna doesn't look brassy. If hair is mostly gray, the red will make it look somewhat orange. Then redo and use brown and red mixed together and use coffee instead of water. There are all types of tricks. Comes with literature too.	2015-08-02

I am a huge Gillette fan, and purchased 3 cans from Amazon. It is extraordinarily thick and gooey. When it worked the shave was OK, but not great. The first can stopped working with more than 50% left. The second can clogged my sink, and forced us to use Drano. After using Drano for a few days, it clogged again which forced me to throw the other cans in the garbage. Now, my sink works fine without this gooey shaving cream. This is only Gillette product that I ever purchased that is unconditionally terrible and a waste of money.	2015-08-02

I think this is a great daily moisturizer for many skin types. My skin gets progressively more oily over the course of the day and certain products will speed that up, but that is not the case here. This Ocean Mineral Lotion sinks in fast while still being hydrating. It's nice not to have a greasy, tacky layer of moisturizer on your skin before you do your makeup! I really like that it contains aloe, which helps my redness, and jojoba oil, which matches my skin's sebum, which makes for less breakouts and less flakey dry skin! I also like that it contains ocean minerals, as the dead sea mud soaps and masks really helped with my acne and my skin responds quite favorably. It also has hyaluronic acid in it as well, so make sure to apply over a toner(no alcohol!) for maximum benefits.  I also like that it was made here in the US, and their products are not tested on animals. I also like that this came in an airless pump instead of a tub, it shows Foxbrim really pays attention to the products they are making!	2015-08-02

When I started wet shaving I used hard soaps, mainly Proraso.  Nothing wrong with them, they get the job done - but the difference is dramatic with TOBS.  I get a closer shave with fewer (virtually zero) nicks and my face feels conditioned after shaving with it.  Scent is a very personal thing, and I've seen a couple of reviewers who say this makes you smell like an &#34;older gentleman&#34; and therefore don't like it.  Personally, I love the scent and so does my wife; I'm in my mid-fifties, so make of that what you will.  Highly recommended.	2015-08-02

Who knew such a small change could make such a Big Impact! This cape is a thousand different types of Amazing. The cape itself weighs next to nothing. It is not like your average plastic cape that is hard and uncomfortable. This one is so soft and breathable yet still very easy to clean. All my customers reported it being incredibly comfortable around the neck and not being hot while wearing it. Not to mention all my co workers want one and all my customers were so excited to use it! I have a small story I would love to share. I have an autistic customer who hates having his head wet as well as the whole getting a haircut process makes him miserable. It is also hard for me to cut it as he is moving etc. Thing cape literally changed both our lives. He was able to play on his phone which distracted him as I was cutting his hair. The 40 minute process took 10 minutes he couldn't even believe I was done. It was truly Amazing!!!!! Not only is it perfect for those type of situations but we are all busy and a lot of work, life, and what not are on your mobile devices this allows everyone to &#34;kill 2 birds with 1 stone&#34; I HIGHLY Recommend this to any Beautician or Barber. You will not regret this purchase. We all want our jobs to be easier! I did receive mine at a discounted rate in order for me to offer my unbiased and honest review. I hope my personal experiences help you to get the most out of yours! Happy Shopping!	2015-08-02

Here is a two in one that could probably also be considered a conditioner, if a light one.<br /><br />I'm I guy and I still have a collection of shampoos, conditioners, body washes and soaps in the shower. Usually to just use whatever I'm in the mood for, or grab something specific to address a certain hygiene topic that I feel needs some attention. Suave Men's Body Wash, Hair & Body 2 in 1 takes the fun of the choice out of that, but also all of the guess work. It is a better body wash than shampoo/conditioner combo, but it does the job. It cleans and rinses off easily, and leaves a light manly scent that fades in about an hour. If you want to get feng shui and remove the clutter from your shower, this is really all the product many men should need. It isn't organic and all-natural, but if you don't mind that, it can't be beat for the price.<br /><br />~ Kort	2015-08-02

Just apply a little to a cotton ball or makeup remover pad and it takes the makeup off easily.<br />*Hair conditioner, applying to the ends only definitely smooths out the dry ends and makes my hair nice and shiny.<br />*Deep conditioning hair mask, I really soaked my hair down and then put a shower cap over it. Next morning washed it out, and my hair looked smooth and frizz free.<br />*Healing dry cracked heels- this works fantastic. I massaged this into my heels daily for 5 days and the cracks healed and my feet are soft and smooth.<br />*Moisturizing Cuticles, my cuticles are not cracking and bleeding anymore after 3 days.<br />*Body oil- I have been massaging this onto my elbows and knees and they are soft now, not rough and dry.<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

I even used the neutral without any color to make shine and improve hair. I've used black, auburn, chestnut, brown and red. I recently learned that gray hair has to be double processed using red first then the color you want. Also learned how to combine colors so the henna doesn't look brassy. If hair is mostly gray, the red will make it look somewhat orange. Then redo and use brown and red mixed together and use coffee instead of water. There are all types of tricks. Comes with literature too.	2015-08-02

This stuff is a great aluminum-free deodorant so it's a nice alternative for those of you who don't want to use an antiperspirant. But while it is effective, easy to use, and smells nice, it does contain the antibacterial ingredient triclosan. So if you're cool with that and are just trying to distance yourself from aluminum, this is great. But if, like me, you're not comfortable with putting that in your armpits I'd say you should try something else. I greatly recommend Herban Cowboy's deodorants if you're looking for another option.	2015-08-02

It comes with two interchangeable heads and has three speeds; high, low, cool.   I have found that this tool is great when it comes to styling hair. Previously, people have complained that it has gotten too hot or left their hair damaged. I have not found this to be true. While it does get hot, I have found that it does not get any hotter than my regular hair dryer. It has to get hot in order to style! It allows so many different hair styles to be accomplished with little practice. It works great on my bangs as well.  I highly recommend this product. Please do not be scared by the &#34;too hot&#34; reviews.	2015-08-02
US	13019826	R1ABU88D6L8ZYF	B00QR6SS6O	546527800	Majestic Pure Essential Oil, 100% Pure and Natural with Therapeutic Grade, Premium Quality Oil 4fl	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	The scent of lemon and the power of a pure oil	I am big into aromatherapy, so I work with a variety of oils. Lemon oil is one of my favorites, though. It, and it blended with other oils, gives a wonderful fresh fragrance that fills the room with a clean, crisp scent. Its great for energizing and refreshing after a long day. This particular brand is very pure. I only need two drops in my warmer to fill my entire living room.<br /><br />The other reason I like this oil so much is because it's a multi-tasker. I can do so much more that fragrance with this, so it's a very good thing that it comes in such a large bottle! It's a big component in my homemade cleaning sprays and polishes. Being so concentrated, a little goes a long way. There are hundreds of formulas online that you can use to make all kinds of cleaning products at home that involve lemon oil, and this is one of the best brands I have found for pure OILS. If you're new to essential oils and how much they can do for you, the company will give you an introduction with purchase, but I would suggest googling &#34;Lemon oil&#60;uses&#60;household&#34; for a ton of uses and ideas that can save you money and unnecessary chemicals every day.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY FAIR, HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

Top Quality Anti Wrinkle Serum	Beauty	5	2	2	N	N	A night cream that really does work.	Wonderful is all I can say. I have used night creams from cheap to very high end, some are a good hit, some aren't worth dragging home and the price of them doesn't seem to have a bearing on how good they are in my opinion. I was given a chance to try this on a promotion and I am glad I did. I seen it was a 2 ounce bottle, (when most are 1 ounce or 1.7 ounce), looked at the price and figured it would be average. I was wrong! It is packaged in an airless pump bottle, solid white to prevent any oxidation or chemical changes. Now remember I am 55 and I have not taken the best care of my hands I should have, I do dishes, clean etc all without gloves, I hate gloves! Anyway out of the box I put about a half pump on the back of my hand, rubbed it in, absorbed very quickly, left no sticky or oily residue, felt really good. I set here reading ingredients, took a pic of the ingredient list on bottle I will attach to review, (the ingredient list is very long and all wonderful ingredients so I knew someone would want to see a list). I looked down and noticed the back of my left hand, was smoother than the right, the little age lines are nice and plumped out. Wow, was my first thought. I have used it now for 4 nights and I can see a fairly big difference in the lines and crows feet I had started to the outside corners and under my eyes. Also lines around mouth are gone, (didn't have very bad ones around mouth anyway, just starting but they are gone). The cream smells wonderful, very light light rose, goes away quickly, but smells clean and good. It is a thicker cream but it just melts when you massage it in. I am truly loving this stuff! My skin is brighter, looks healthy, firmer, lines are lessened. This product will remain at the top of my list, as I feel with continued usage the difference in my skin will continue to improve.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

Almost incapable of cutting you (I nicked myself down there once a few months ago), you can ensure that you get an even cut anywhere.  The only downside is that it cannot shave the smallest stubble so you will be left with really small hairs.  The Bodygroom cleans easily and it's charging stand makes a good holder when not in use.	2015-08-02

I used it according to the directions EVERY day. Twice daily, morning and night, and making sure it got on my skin not just on the brow hair. It did take finishing the entire tube to see obvious results, and I bought another tube to continue growth. I am so very happy with this product!!! :)	2015-08-02

My old straightener was wider and got the job done and lasted years, but the main reason I had to replace it was because the wires were starting to be exposed, and slowly falling apart. I did some research and everybody seemed to love this straightener and it wasn't expensive. It works, and I like that it has the auto turn off, but wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. Maybe because it isn't wider, or the temperature doesn't get as hot as I would like it to.      UPDATE:  Have had this product for over 6mths now, and wish I got a different straightener. Tried one at the mall for $50 and it made my hair look amazing! This thing is not worth the money. A $20 straightener would do the same or better.	2015-08-02

My skin isn't even that sensitive and I haven't came across anything that makes me break out besides this toner. I tried it since it's vitamin c and also organic. It's slimy and sticky. Feels terrible on the skin and also left me with a patchy rash through out my face. I instantly washed it off and slept it off so by morning my face was normal again ( I have no acne on my face, just got this for aging) I tried it 3 seperate times and it was the same every time.  Just money wasted. There's little vitamin c serums on here that are fine. Bigger percentage too. I'd say try that first although it's more on the pricey side.	2015-08-02

I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I'm 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It's generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.<br /><br />Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin. The cleanser specifically is very gentle on my skin and I feel it does a great job removing dirt and oil and my skin doesn't feel dried out after I finish washing.<br /><br />I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I've never felt better about my own face and it's because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.<br /><br />There's something about this line that just works for me and<br />I'm so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it's a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it's completely worth it.	2015-08-02

I am a believer! :)	I positively LOVE Earth Science's papaya-glycolic radiant skin masque!  I discovered this product a good twenty-years ago when it was listed in a natural-health newsletter that I subscribed to.  THIS PRODUCT HAS SO MUCH GOING FOR IT!  It is paraben free, cruelty free, vegan, and gluten free.  That's the good news healthwise!  Let's face it, though gals:  Our #1 reason for buying any beauty product is what it does for our looks!  I have tried many facial masques over the years--at varying prices--and can honestly say that this face masque has them all beat!  It is the only product I have ever used that gives INSTANT RESULTS!  I noticed that immediately after using this product, not only is my face smoother, but the circulation in my face has stepped up!  When I wake in the morning, I'm usually pale looking and it takes several hours for my circulation to step up; however, immediately after using this product, I find that my facial circulation has improved and I have a nice rosy glow!  (not red and irritated; rosy as in healthy looking!) As circulation is a good thing, I feel that I am not only getting instant benefits from using this product, but long-term benefits as well!	2015-08-02

I was given a discount in order to provide my honest feedback on this product.

That is ok, the benefits are definitely worth it and yucky addictives are no good for your skin anyways! I compare this face mask to Origins ash clay mask because of the detox ingredients and high quality.<br /><br />The consistency is rich and a little goes a long way so start with a little bit! I also want to add that there is an actual expiration date on the product! Too many times I buy beauty items and have no idea when it'll be good until. This little added touch gives me comfort that the product I'm using is fresh and a date to toss it out; how neat!	2015-08-02

This 100% natural liquid hand soap by Puracy is a great all natural soap.<br /><br />It contains no phosphates, chlorine, ammonia, or dyes of any kind. Instead, it uses plant and sugar based ingredients which surprisingly are very effective at cleaning your hands without harming your skin. It cuts through grease and grime very well and is comparable to some of the top brands that aren't as gentle on your skin.<br /><br />Its an interesting decision on Puracy's part when it comes to the fragrance, typically lavender is used for soothing/calming in lotions but they decided to throw a little bit into some hand soap. At first I wasn't sold on the idea but I have a habit of washing my hands as soon as I come home from work (I don't get home until 9-930pm) and I have come to enjoy the scent very much. I am a huge lavender fan, I use lavender oil nightly in my diffuser which is bed side so this made perfect sense once I really thought about it.<br /><br />You are paying a premium for Puracy's product line, there is no doubt about that however it really is quality product. This is more of a &#34;Whole Foods&#34; type product not something you'd typically find at Walmart or stores like that. You do get what you pay for when it comes to the Puracy line.<br /><br />I received a sample for review purposes.	2015-08-02

So excited to have gotten my teeth whitening kit. I have been dying to get one but i didn’t really want to spend 50+. I was lucky enough to get this at a deeply discounted price. In the box it came with very clear instruction. Two 5ml syringes and two thermal try. Have the water boiled and only place the trays for about a second and place it into your mouth to get your teeth impressions. Place the only 1ml of the teeth gel on both trays even less to be honest. I just did the fifteen minutes it started to bubble as soon as the tray with the gel was placed. If you have sensitive teeth I don’t recommend you do this it kinda irritated me in the beginning then I got used to it. Since this is my first treatment i didn’t see any change but It does give you that freshly brushed feeling when you are done. Since this came with 10ml of the gel so I think I’m going to do this once a week to see if this truly whitens my teeth.	2015-08-02

This deep cleaning mask is wonderful!<br />First of all, it smells so good, just like sesame seeds.<br />The texture is nice, but make sure your face isn't too damp or it will be a little runny when you massage it on.<br /><br />It exfoliates gently, and it has helped my blackheads along with cleaning out my pores (getting rid of sebum, dead skin cells, etc.), which has also lead to smaller pores.

That does not affect my opinion in any way. My review is my own and completely honest.<br /><br />Honestly – this may not have been the past purchase for me. I recently turned 30 and do not suffer from fine lines or wrinkles. Well maybe I do, but I just don’t care enough about them to be concerned and need a product to correct them. I used this serum for a few weeks and did not notice any significant changes in my facial skin. That isn’t a negative thing – there is just nothing that I noticed which had changed. So I am neutral as to the visual effects of this product.<br /><br />As for the texture and consistency of the product – it was a really a great product. It was not too oily and it had a really good consistency. It did not dry out my skin at all. I have very sensitive skin, especially on my face, so I am always nervous about trying new products. This serum was a good for my skin and did not cause any irritation.<br /><br />Again, this product just wasn’t for me at this time in my life. It’s a great product, but just not for me.	2015-08-02

I have naturally dark blonde hair.  I use Natural Instincts to get rid of my gray every 2 months or so.  Normally I stick to the blonde or light brown colors.  They fade really quickly though.  From sun and the pool my hair was lighter than normal but I wanted to change it up, so I tried Cinnaberry, a auburn shade.  I probably should not have tried it on the blondish hair.  At first it was a bright reddish, pink color.  And...there wasn't really enough in the bottle to cover all my hair.  My hair is a little pass shoulder length and is a medium thickness, so one bottle should be plenty.  It was patchy in areas.<br /><br />Luckily, red doesn't hold well in my hair and after 3 washes and swimming in the pool, it is now a normal looking red color, though still splotchy.  I'd recommend this for brunettes and if you have longer than shoulder length hair, get two boxes.  One thing I love about Natural Instincts is that it does wash out and it doesn't dry out your hair.<br /><br />So, I tried something new and it didn't work out so well for me.  I'll stick to my blonde and light brown shades from now on.	2015-08-02

I've been using a 10% glycolic cream by a different brand for about a year. I like it but it don't creams. I'm more of a serum girl and this is perfect. I've used it for about 2 months every night and my skin has never been so smooth and radiant. The acne scars on my forehead are disappearing. My pores noticeably smaller. Also I'm less oily. In the morning, I wash with African black soap and apply 10% benzoyl peroxide cream. It's not overly creamy like lotion and it absorbs fast. At night I wash my face with the same soap and apply the AHA serum. It's all I need. I use it on my chest and neck too. Once a week, I'll use a PMD and I don't use the serum afterwards because it'll burn and I've done that before. Follow the directions. Especially if you're sensitive. I only use 4 drops of the serum. Just 4 and that's it. I put the drops in palm and use my fingertips to spread on my face. It's a little watery but that's fine. It dries quick. I will repurchase this again. Definitely recommend. No adverse effects. I'm interested in buying the other products as well.	2015-08-02

I did receive this product at discount in exchange for an  honest review. Had the outside tube resembled more closely to the black case, I would have given a five star account. The actual product is a whole different story. The lipstick is creamy and applied very smoothly. I loved the color - it had a purplish lavender hue to the lipstick, one that I would wear on occasion. I am glad that I did buy this product because I found that the effectiveness, the pretty color were definitely worth the price they asked. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high end lipstick. No feathering, and it lasted a good 6 hours without any fading.	2015-08-02

My hair is very fine and curly. I swim a lot and my hair was stiff like straw at times. This made my hair so healthy and curly that I don't have to wash my hair every day anymore to keep the curl.

Not even close. I used the dollar store razors for 2 years (sold in 7 packs for $2.50).  They were simply the best razor ever ... and cheap! After the dollar store replaced them with Noxzema triple blade razors (2 packs for $1.00), I searched Amazon and found the double blades here. Excited, I bought three 12 packs. Sadly, these are an inferior product, much lighter and with a thinner head than the long lost dollar store variety. The cut my face all to hell and I can't use them.

Depends on what it will be used for:)	Fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the whole oil: Certain components of the oil are separated or removed from the oil for a particular use. Different uses of fractionated coconut oil include industrial, medical applications and beauty products. However, it is not the complete, virgin coconut oil.<br /><br />Virgin coconut oil retains the plant’s original chemical composition – and consequently the plant’s therapeutic benefits. Coconut oil contains for the most part saturated fatty acids, with a small percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It also contains glycerides. Natural coconut oil contains short and medium-chain length triglycerides whereas fractionated coconut oil may have certain medium-chain fatty acids removed or separated.<br /><br />USES OF FRACTIONATED COCONUT OIL:<br /><br />Being thin and stable, it has plenty of uses which can be broadly categorized in the following applications.<br /><br />*Cosmetics - It is widely used in the preparation of soaps, lotions, ointments and other cosmetics.<br /><br />*Aromatherapy - It is used as a carrier oil, since it facilitates the absorption of other oils and herbal extracts.<br /><br />*Medicines - -It is used due to its antiseptic and disinfectant properties.<br /><br />*Hair Care - It is also used in a number of hair care applications.<br /><br />*Culinary Usage - It is used in cooking, as it does not go rancid easily and is very stable.<br /><br />#1:  My personal preference for this oil is in my hair care regime.  I use coconut oil (virgin) in a deep conditioning treatment once per week.  I coat my entire head of hair, from root to tip and leave it on overnight.  Now, I normally have to wear a silk scarf or use an old designated pillow case, otherwise...well you can imagine.  I've been doing this for years, however, I was offered this fractionated coconut oil in lieu of a fair review, so I wanted to try it out and I'm really happy that I did.<br /><br />I really like the options of bottom tops, and chose the pump dispenser and this makes it really easy to use.  I've don't two treatments on my hair and my hair seems to completely absorb this oil much better than virgin coconut oil.  I've been really pleased with how soft my hair has been after the wash.  Of course, it's not as heavy as virgin coconut oil either.<br /><br />I also like to calm static or frizzies from my hair with a dab of this and comb through my hair.  It tames it and leaves a nice sheen without the greasiness.<br /><br />#2:  I have used this as a carrier oil with cinnamon essential oil, which can be really strong.  I like to use cinnamon oil on flaky, dry skin patches and it smells good as well.  I've been happy with this application as it absorbs quickly and I don't feel greasy like when I normally use grape seed oil.  It is also nice straight on the skin, again, it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.<br /><br />#3:  I have saut&eacute;ed onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes - garam masala + cumin + curry = base for Indian curry or korma.  It takes a high heat and if you are not using coconut milk in your recipe, this was nice as it avoided the coconut flavor.e.

I bought this as a replacement for my previous Braun shaver, as has been my practice for many years.  I've simply bought the best Braun available and been very happy, until now. The problem is that this would be perceived as &#34;the best&#34; based on price, which is apparently no longer true.  I have been using this razor for 4 months, have charged, cleaned, and done everything in between, and can now say IT SIMPLY IS INFERIOR TO PREVIOUS MODELS. Here's why:  it has 3 power settings, with the dark blue labeled as the strongest, but that is a mislabeling, as the settings should be &#34;weak,&#34; &#34;weaker,&#34; and &#34;weakest!&#34;  Both of my older Brauns (which are almost worn out) shave my beard WAY closer than this thing!

Then, wondered, if the Flosser for Kids are the same size as the Travel size, and has the same power as the one for adults.  So, here's my opinion:  The Flosser for Kids are cheaper than the adult's Travel size.  The Flosser for Kids hold enough water for one use, and the water reservoir fits upside down for packing.  The dials are different:  The regular adult size (for home use) has a dial from 1 to 10.  I like to use the adult one at home around 7 or 8, sometimes 9 (I have braces right now.)  The Floosser for Kids only have 3 lines on the dial, but the second one or some where between the second and the 3rd line was about the same as around 8 in the Adults.  I'm happy to be able to take the Flosser for Kids on the road, and not have to miss the one at home.	2015-08-02

The 10 times side = which is harder to find, will bring a feeling of freedom to many folks with glasses.<br />For me = I can now see facial details without my glasses in the way.<br /><br />The base (7 1/2&#34; dia) is weighted so the mirror isn't top heavy, making it right at 4 lb.<br />The mirrored center of each side is 6 1/2&#34; diameter, with 1/2&#34; circle of light.<br /><br />It's 18 1/2&#34; tall, so if by the bathroom sink it will likely be somewhat in front of the vanity mirror.<br />But it has a 5 ft long cord for moving around, plus the cord comes with a Velcro strap for wrapping it up tidy.<br />If at a vanity / or table, the cord is a good length to reach an outlet.<br /><br />The mirror frame is an attractive 2 3/4&#34; thick which adds a balanced and rich appearance to the overall design.<br />The bulb is 13 watt / 6500 Kelvin / 80 CRI - fluorescent.<br /><br />((((CRI). This is the accuracy of the ability of the bulbs light to show colors in their true color.<br />&#62; 100 being the highest number, = for a black body (incandescent lamps are effectively black-bodies)<br />&#62; 80 plus for typical LED. (some manufacturers say their LEDs are up to 98 CRI)<br />&#62; 50 for basic fluorescent lights, to 90 for the best tr-phosphor type)))<br />So given this scale = this 80 CRI - fluorescent is pretty true to life color.<br /><br />The mirror rotates easily - it's glare & fog free.<br />The 10,000 hour bulb at an hour a day is expected to last over 27 years.<br />This 'FSL' = full spectrum light is engineered to simulate natural daylight indoors, for reducing eye strain & glare.<br /><br />I have only one con = one mirror had several specks that appeared to be manufacture defects,<br />but lighter fluid on a cloth removed them all but two. There very small (a pin prick) & not an issue for me but may be for some.<br /><br />&#62; 1st photo = bathroom lights on, 2nd photo lights out.<br /><br /> LOVE it !<br /><br />Bulb is replaceable = 13 watt bare-spiral self ballast compact fluorescent bulb.see these online prices. However =  the mirror does look and feel the quality and price of the on line up-charge.  Bulb is replaceable = 13 watt bare-spiral self ballast compact fluorescent bulb.	2015-08-02

As with all hair care products, they work differently in different types of hair. My husband has short, dry hair and it works great for him. I have long, curly, and tending toward frizzy hair and it works great for me. I do change around every couple times to nourish my hair with different formulations. This is one of my regulars and my husband and I both like the way it moisturizes our hair. I have no problem with the tangles after, but have not used chemical-laden conditioners for years, so am not missing that slippery feeling they give. The other regular use conditioner for me is ShiKai Everyday conditioner. Works great also.	2015-08-02

It's a slightly different color than I thought, I was expecting a dark blue (although the description clearly says teal) but it is just as beautiful.

This brand of eyeliner is really great, easy to apply, dries quickly, stays in place, and has a precision tip applicator. The formula stays smooth and doesn't get chalky or clumpy which makes sure that your application is as precise as possible. The most natural/vegan line I have seen that also works the best and for a great price! I'm so happy I stumbled upon this brand!	2015-08-02

I was really skeptical of this stuff at first since I rarely have success with DIY whitening, but I'm happy to announce that it truly does work. It's NOT toothpaste but a booster meant to be used with your regular toothpaste. Just add a small amount of this to your toothbrush along with your usual toothpaste and brush as normal.<br /><br />The key to this stuff is consistent use. I do think it started making a very subtle difference right away, but it was at least a week or two of consistent (2X a day) use before I started to notice a real difference. I've now been using it (off and on) for over a year and while I may have reached my set point as far as how white my teeth will get without professional whitening, I'm very happy with results I've gotten from this and will continue to use it since it definitely helps keep new stains at bay. I doubt it will do much for deep discoloration (esp. stains due to things like decay), but it works great for mild to moderate staining from things like coffee.<br /><br />I usually worry about whitening products because I know they can cause enamel deterioration and the like, but I haven't experienced any increased sensitivity or deterioration that I can attribute to this stuff. So while you should watch out for those signs just in case, I highly recommend giving this stuff a try!	2015-08-02

I ordered Sabrina’s Coco-Mango Body Butter and was excited when my package arrived. I could smell the fragrance though the manila envelope that I thought was a very pleasing scent. However, due to the high temperatures, this body butter arrived melted, which did not bother me at all. I just left it to sit, cool, and solidify.<br /><br />Once it had solidified, I was able to open the container. I am not sure of its original consistency prior to shipping, but I found this consistency to be soft, a tad greasy, but effective in its ability to lock in the moisture of my skin and improve the look of my elbows and knees (they had a sheen to them that I liked).<br /><br />Overall, my skin felt good and looked good. I did apply a tad to the ends of my hair and I liked the look as well.<br /><br />I was selected to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-02

My mascara was pretty dry at first, but now it seems to be covering much better. Possibly, I had residue from a previous mascara???? In any event, I do like it now. It covers well, stays on, ad is easy to remove. Oh and the product was delivered very quickly.	2015-08-02
US	18397378	R1INRHE3ON5HJL	B00OHXPMCM	300959391	InstaNatural Night Cream - Anti Aging Face Lotion for Men & Women - Age & Deep Wrinkle Recovery Moisturizer for Healthy Skin - Rapid Repair Formula - Works on Eye Bags, Fine Lines & Puffiness - 3.4 OZ	Beauty	5	0	0	N	Y	Another great product in this line	I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I'm 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It's generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.<br /><br />Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin.<br /><br />The night cream is very gentle and I feel does a fantastic job of healing and softening my skin. Sometimes the serum can cause minor irritation but the moisturizer really helps keep and blotches or redness in check.<br /><br />I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I've never felt better about my own face and it's because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.<br /><br />There's something about this line that just works for me and<br />I'm so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it's a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it's completely worth it.	2015-08-02

She's now 65, and it has become her favorite moisturizer (and really only skin care routine). She says a little goes a long way, so she only needs a new bottle every couple of months. I used to use hers anytime I was at her house, and now I love it so much I started buying it for myself. I don't always wear foundation, but when I do I find that it goes on much smoother if I have this moisturizer on underneath.<br />I highly doubt it does much to reverse wrinkles, but it does keep your skin moisturized all day, which does keep it looking younger and might help stave off future signs of aging. Also, it's always significantly cheaper her on Amazon than in my local pharmacies. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good moisturizer, regardless of your stage in the aging process!	2015-08-02

I have been using Sebastian Cellophanes for years and have been a happy campier.  Due to my job I had to relocate for 4 months and was unable to find Cellophanes at any of the beauty salons I visited.  One salon convinced me to try Mulier Imagitiv and WOW was I happy upon seeing the results.  I was quite concerned during the application process and worried how the color would look and what it would do to my hair but I did not have anything to worry about.  The color came out beautifully, my hair was soft..it was perfect.  The color last even longer than Cellophane; it lasted the close to 3 months. I returned home and assumed because I live in NYC  I would locate Mulier Imagitiv at any beauty salon; was I ever wrong!! I couldn't find it anywhere and boy did I try.  I finally decided to try Amazon and found it here; made my day.  Only negative it isn't the hair color I used while travelling however when I mix it with the Cellophanes Honey Blonde it comes out wonderfully and lasts quite a few washes before dulling down.. Vendor was great; I received the product prior to the expected delivery date.	2015-08-02

I got this set as part of a deal on Facebook. Paid $7 for the set.<br /><br />While the pick up is good enough, I was able to apply my mineral and compact eye shadow with the smaller brushes well enough. However the larger guys didn't have as much pick up. The flat blush brush was really amazing. Almost worth the entire price I paid. I also love the blenders that came with the set. One is a course sponge, the other a finer one. I'd been meaning to try blenders and this was a great way for me to try them.<br /><br />There was a lot of shedding though. Even after a few times of using them. That's my only concern and issue with them. I also didn't care much about the bag.

There is no bit of tightness or dryness to the skin. I have no noticed a noticable &#34;brightness&#34; but I do notice after washing it off that my skin has really soft feel and looks smooth.

This product is so good, dandruff on my son's scalp gone with just one week of use. He maintains it once a week to keep dandruff away. It also makes my hair so soft, it relaxes my curly hair, i mix this with my conditioner and keep it on my hair for 3 minutes and makes my hair more straight and so shiny. I had some allergy before with a product and made my scalp itchy and sometimes wounded but when i used this castor oil, the itch and wound completely disappeared !!! Wonderful product. It is also good for my heels, no more cracks. For my skin, less wrinkles, definitely lots of moisture and hydration. I will buy this again and again.

The formula creates a film on the layer of the skin and transports this water over time. The 50X Strength of the Hyaluronic Acid makes it more potent and provides maximum water binding capacity.<br /><br />One single application of this HA makes the skin look a lot younger, radiant and even-toned. Using this moisturizer/serum the skin would be dramatically plumped and lifted with incredible moisture.<br />This Serum is GENTLE, EFFECTIVE & SAFE for all skin types; including those with sensitive skin.<br /><br />Vegan, Paraben-free, oil-free, no dyes, no fragrances or fillers, Oily Skin remedy<br />- Rejuvenates the look of dull skin for a smoother, more even skin tone<br />- Helps in fighting with the dryness /redness on face with professional hydration<br />- Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles<br />- Fights with the dark circles under the eyes and the eye puffiness<br /><br />50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can hold 4,000 to 5,000 times its own weight in water. As it binds water to it, the individual molecules expand. This inflation of the Serum on a molecular level helps to plump the skin. It hydrates the skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and gives you a healthy, plump, smooth and glowing appearance. The amazing plumping abilities of 50 x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can be demonstrated with a dried apricot. After a few hours' immersions in a beaker of the ingredient, a dried apricot will hydrate and plump back to its original shape and my wife totally swears by this product,<br />wrinkle removing and prevention that is too Frankenstein like for me but what ever it takes for the bride to keep from looking like broom Hilda I good with it.	2015-08-02

I have tried a few skincare lines over the years but never really liked any of them and since I didn't notice much difference (if any), I stopped using them.

I started using this cream at night only and have noticed more of a difference than I ever have from any product I've used in the past. My skin feels so smooth and silky and dare I say younger?

My nose piercing, which is 10 years old, gets infected once in a while. I used to clean it with a tea tree solution but tea tree is very strong on the skin and left my skin very dry and a little darker where the infection used to be. I wanted to apply sea salt soaks to my infection since it is pretty effective but it can be messy and requires a bit of time to prepare the solution (and I have to do several soaks a day to fight the infection). I found this spray on amazon and I've been using it for almost a year now (on my second bottle now). It calms my infection really well and the best part is how convenient it is to use (compared to preparing warm sea salt soaks). I use it about 3 times a day when I have a piercing infection.<br /><br />After so many years of dealing with piercing infections, I'm pretty good at knowing when an infection is about to start again and when that happens, I quickly spray this on my piercing to prevent it. It's done a pretty good job at keeping infection away almost 98% of the time.	2015-08-02

When first I was struck with hot flashes about 14 years ago, they were severe and brought me to my knees. I did not want to go the route of prescribed synthetic hormones. I suffered for about 3 to 4 years before accidentally discovering Phyto-B. I have been using this product for close to 10 years. I too panicked when the pellets were discontinued. Then came the liquid form to the rescue!  It has saved my life, actually allowed me to regain my life. I have been purchasing it from Amazon for about the last 5 years, never a problem. So grateful.	2015-08-02

The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a pump, but I bought an airless pump bottle and pour my Poreless Concealer in it so it stays germ free and does not dry out.  It also makes it easy and clean to dispense.<br />I would suggest going to a drugstore to see the bottles in person to get a better idea of what shade you are before purchasing online.  I would definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />____________________<br />Color: 112 Natural Ivory<br />Price: $5.94<br />Sold by: Amazon LLC<br />Shipped by: Amazon LLC<br />Delivered: 5 days after order date	2015-08-02

Roll ons took too long to dry	I have been trying out different natural deodorants over the years but was never fully happy. Roll ons took too long to dry, creams left white marks on my clothes or didn't quite melt well into my pits, and most gels did absolutely nothing other than maybe perfume my B.O. I happened to end up in the beauty/health section of Whole Foods and was looking at the ingredients and decided to try out this brand. If I hadn't been there to smell the actual product I would have gone with the unscented version to be safe but I REALLY love the Dusk scent. It's very Old-spicey-esque but without that weird chemically alcoholy aspect to it (plus it's not overwhelming). Most importantly of course, this stuff really works! The gel doesn't clump up in my pit hair (tmi?), it dries very quickly, and seriously does keep me smelling nice all day. I went on a hike just the other day in 90 degree super humid Virginia and I was the only one in my group who didn't smell like B.O. by the end of our 8 miles. Definitely recommend!! And this is coming from a very sweaty and stinky person. Just remember that this is NOT an antiperspirant (which isn't good for you in the first place, sweating is important for your bodily functions) so don't expect this to stop your sweat.	2015-08-02

Great fragrance; very true to the flower it's named after.  The vial is small, but a little goes a long way - - for days, actually.  Makes my dear wife smell like she did in 1972.  Liked it then, like it now.  (Loved her then, love her now.) You won't be disappointed. Simple, fragrant, and easy to enjoy without a squirt of musk, patchouli, or incense to override the scent.  If you enjoy a &#34;natural&#34; scent, you might really like this one.  Trust me.  Many of the vintage perfumes have been severely compromised.  Shalimar was once a wonderful scent; it was the signature scent of my late dear aunt.  However, I believe it's now manufactured with brake fluid or something equally vile, and they still sell it for $50 a bottle!  Smells awful.  But Kuumba still has it together, and it smells great.  Nice to find an honest company these days. . . . . . . .	2015-08-02

You can use the tooth whitening system the way that you use your toothpaste or gel - and I like that it does not foam like crazy (I have an electric toothbrush and some toothpastes go all over the place). First you apply the purifying cleanser for one minute - do NOT rinse with water afterwards! I like the nice minty taste of it. Afterwards you apply the perfecting gel for one minute. I wished the gel was a little bit more minty - but otherwise it is good and does not irritate my gums. I cannot see that my teeth are six times whiter as promised after one week (but I use a good electronic toothbrush that usually removes stains and plaque pretty well) - but my mouth feels clean and healthy without the hassle of whitening strips and normal time involvement as I always brush for two minutes. The cost is lower compared with whitening strips and the system should last approximately two months. I like that you get a full money back guarantee if you do not like it. I am trying it free thanks to Crest.	2015-08-02

At 60 years old, this is true even more than when I was young, and a subtle touch is just perfect for me.  This Neutrogena Blush is light, natural and fresh looking and that is why I like it.<br /><br />I ordered the Rosy color and when the package came, there was also the Bronzed and Luminous included.  So I was able to try all three colors.  They all go  on easily and light and give the skin a glow with faint color to create a naturally beautiful look that doesn't seem overdone.  Just a little &#34;sun kissed&#34; and nothing more.  I think it is perfect.<br /><br />If you are a purist when it comes to natural and non-toxic, this is probably safe enough for most people, but the ingredient list has a lot of unpronounceable ingredients.  So those of us who really, REALLY want to be ABSOLUTELY NATURAL, might want to look further to get exactly the right product.  If you just want something that looks nice and isn't irritating, this might be exactly the thing for you.<br /><br />So if you are fond of a refined look that seems natural and not made up, you should like this.  If you are used to a dramatic look, then you might not care for this particular product because it goes on light and the color is faint and almost undetectable.  Just right for an &#34;Earth Mother&#34; but probably not enough drama for a &#34;Beauty Queen&#34;.	2015-08-02

I wanted to stay that this does retain color. Does the repair against damage may ask well you can’t really repair damage. After damage has been done there’s no way to repair it. Does it make your hair silky and shiny well yes of course this is a sprite in product it’s going to makemake your hair shiny and silky. The product also claims to fix for us well I have some Hairs that never stay. Have you use this product on the way into my hair I’ve used it on the head and I don’t see anything with the frizz control. Does that help with the body absolutely I love the body that I have in my hair after using this product. Does a man you’re splitting aunts now no product can officially menu splitting and conditioner does not mean your split ends it just put some protein into the ends to keep them together until you cut it. Does it detangler absolutely have no trouble after using this product brushing and parting My hair is great. Does it help your style steak not really but on the other hand my hair straight and I really don’t do much to it so I cannot stay that it does so I use this product online and her style stayed the next day. No static well static is always going to be an issue with any product so this does not have static electricity but your hair is not going to be more attracted to frizzing up as much. Thermal guard it does protect your hair against thermal styling which is one reason I wanted to review this product which I feel like I would use this over a thermal protectant spray it’s that amazing. Wireless well this product is very white and this is like putting water on your hair that’s how weightless. I would recommend this to a professional which I am myself and any clients customers that are looking for a quick and easy leaving thermal protector that needs body and needs a detangling spray. I would say overall this product works and I would buy it. I’ve looked into the business and I found a lot of products that I would also like to review until my followers and etc.hat I would also like to review until my followers and etc.	2015-08-02

Cheap Product.	Guys,<br />Please read this review before making a decision.<br /><br />I bought this item several months ago as an &#34;ADD ON ITEM&#34; and I had no complaints. In fact I purchased more than one units.<br />The rubber bands worked as expected. So I planned to &#34;ORDER AGAIN&#34; the same item from my order history and that was a mistake.<br /><br />The product that I received as a part of reordering is super cheap and very low quality. The rubber bands are very weak. They break and even slip away or do not hold in position. I tried to use more than one bands to see if that holds, but it does not. When it breaks, it breaks into many pieces. Something is horribly wrong with this product.<br /><br />The product itself is over-priced as mentioned by another reviewer. Try looking for another comparable item. Am sure one could find something at a much better price and better quality.	2015-08-02

Unfortunately, I decided to try it this last May and I seemed really orange-y. I wonder if they've changed the formula?

Looking for an additional step to greatly improve your skin care routine? Witch Hazel is the way to go. Unlike most toners that contain alcohol, witch hazel doesn't dry out or strip your skin. I find that it adding witch hazel to my routine cleared my skin and improved my skin tone without any adverse effects. Just cleanse with your facial cleaner of choice, use the witch hazel on a cotton pad, and top with a moisturizer.<br />Some people complain about the smell, and I can understand that. It's not a bad smell, it's just different, kind of earthy. It goes away completely after applying to your face, and I don't notice the smell at all anymore. This is a great brand, and great price point.	2015-08-02

[[VIDEOID:ed97333a1b1f45c931af0877ac77a4f7]]When I saw this Geekable Park silicone facial massager I was really intrigued.  I've never seen a product anything like this, but now that I've tried it I realize what a clever idea and design it is.  The entire surface is covered in a high quality smooth silicone, with tiny hair-like bristles on the front of the paddle.  The shape and the silicone material combine to make it very easy to grip and generally comfortable to hold onto during use.  It's great that it recharges with the included USB cord, so there's no need to fuss with batteries.  Now that I've used this, I definitely prefer washing my face with this massager.  I just get my normal facial cleanser lathered up on my face as I always would, but then instead of just using my heads to rub it in, I use the Geekable Park device to get it thoroughly down into the pores.  It also feels great, like a bit of a massage for my face.  There are four different speeds/intensities that I can choose from by just pressing the plus and minus buttons and I also can vary if I'm using the tip of the device with the larger silicone bristles or the main part of the paddle with its tiny bristles.<br /><br />It stays on for one minute, with a quick pulse after 30 seconds and a couple more pulses in the second 30 seconds to help keep track of how long I've been washing my face.  If the one minute isn't long enough, it's very easy to press the button to turn it back on.  The silicone is very easy to clean when I'm all done.  My face ends up feeling extra clean - really the skin is softer than I'm used to!<br /><br />I also feel I have to mention that I can see people wanting to use this for more intimate purposes as well.  The silicone material and vibrating massage definitely make one think of an adult toy.  The minute shut off timer though may be a tamper for this kind of use.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I was able to receive this as a free promotional sample in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.w.	2015-08-02

These kitty ears are super cute and perfect for so many occasions. The ears are made of a delicate black lace, with lace edging. They're wired so you can pose them any way you like. They're firmly attached to a black headband. My only issue is that the headband isn't adjustable, so if you have  a larger head these might be a little small. They would be adorable for a little girl or a grown up lady for Halloween costumes, cosplay, or just everyday dress up. At this price they're a good deal and a cute item to just keep on hand- you never know when your inner cat might meow to get out!<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.	2015-08-02

I have dark blonde/light brown colors in my hair that I had gotten balayged and toned to look ashy. I personally love the neutral/ash look and since my hair wasn't blonde the purple shampoo had no use for me. According to my colorist and a color wheel I referenced the green in this hazelnut wash really helped contrast the reddish/copper undertones my light brown/dark blonde (about a level 5-6) hair had. I appreciate a good and natural product and loved that this was sulfate free and not tested on animals. I used this 1-2 times a week depending on how much color I wanted deposited and I would notice a difference every time and so did my friends and co workers! I have this wash as well as the cocoa rinse depending on how dark or ashy I want to be. The cocoa rinse deposits a neutral brown so it makes my hair look a bit darker. I would use a regular shampoo on my scalp since my roots were my natural dark brown color anyways then I would squeeze out any excess water in my hair and apply this shampoo liberally and leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing it out and it works great.	2015-08-02

Great kit if you've considered contouring or just need some concealer in general. The multi color palette is pretty convenient and it allows for some really nice blending. The stuff doesn't irritate my skin and stays on for a while, so overall, I'm rather content with it. I don't wear makeup much, but this will do for those special occasions that I do. I'm a beginner at contouring, and the palette is good enough for me the choices of colors are nice to pick and blend, I would recommend looking up youtube tutorials if you're not an expert at it.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-02

Well, a lot, admittedly.

It also doesn't dry my skin out (although I do use moisturizing products, as well.) And it has minimized my pores a little, but mostly it controls sebum.<br />I have already bought a second container of it because I love it so much!

I've had this type of hairdryer for 20 years now.  Works pretty good for frizzy hair - drying and straightening at the same time - yet keeping the natural curl at the bottom, unlike hair straighteners the makes hair look stiff.  I have fine asian hair so drying takes 5 minutes.  Maybe longer time for thicker hair strands.

Has it lightened my sun spots? Nope.	I am a younger guy who has spent too much time in the sun and thus, have developed some sun spots. After vetting various products, I came to the conclusion that this product may be the ticket. After all, &#34;customers report that age and dark spots fade&#34; after using this product.<br /><br />Well, maybe my skin is different. Maybe I had unfair expectations. However, this product has not lightened any of my sun spots at all. I am sure the product is good for my skin - it is organic, replenishes some vitamins, etc. and after use, my skin feels tight, a bit refreshed. But I bought this product not because I am worried about wrinkles, but because I want my sun spots to fade. Using this anticipated result as a benchmark, the product hasn't impressed me. I give it three stars because I think it may be a good product that is good for your skin - I just haven't had the results I am looking for.	2015-08-02

Many reviewers said to put in on your bare skin first, then put your moisturize on top, so I did that.  The problem is that my moisturizer does other things like fade my freckles and age spots and firm my skin, which it stopped doing because it couldn't reach my skin with this product underneath.  So I will not be using it because after a week my freckles got darker and my skin got saggier until I figured out what was happening.  It does plump the skin when used under a moisturizer though, so that part is true.	2015-08-02

I got this delicious strawberry lip scrub as part of a special promotion in return for my honest review.<br />I really loved this product, the smell of fresh strawberries is fantastic and it did a great job taking care of the dry skin along the edges of my lips, leaving them surprisingly smooth and soft. You do have to be a bit careful while applying, but as long as you keep your lips moist beforehand, you shouldn't have any problems. I also appreciated the matte finish on the lid, making it easy to open and close tight and it was a nice touch that they printed the name and information directly on the bottle, rather than on a label that could VERY easily get wet over time and come off, seeing as this product is most likely going to have a home in your bathroom for daily use. The lip scrub smelled, tasted and worked like a professional beauty product and I will definitely be looking into trying out some of the 11 different flavors!	2015-08-02

I bought these razors to avoid the pain of waxing/threading my eyebrows and upper lip. This product is the equivalent of a pocket knife with a razor instead of a blade--a great idea. However, the concept of facial shaving causes hairs to grow back after just a couple days--so shaving is not nearly as efficient as other forms of hair removal. I think that was the biggest disappointment of the purchase. Still, I use the razors to remove the peach fuzz on my upper lip every few days because it is less painful than waxing/threading and faster than attempting to pluck.	2015-08-02

I purchased it after seeing all the great reviews and the all natural ingredients as well as also having heard great things about it from a cousin who has great skin. I'm also a skincare junkie and have bought/tried several other masks but ultimately come back to this one. I bought it over a year ago and tried it for myself and loved it. I mix even parts Bragg's apple cider vinegar and this powder in a glass bowl and mix it in with a facial brush. I leave it on until it's dry and by then I am itching to take it off! The tightening and pulsating feeling it gives off reassures me that it is doing its job. I definitely feel like my face gets detoxified and when I take it off my face is tomato red. That only lasts for 15-20 minutes and I know my skin is being renewed since all the blood is drawn toward my skin and the circulation is intensified. After rinsing it off I use Thayer's Witch Hazel and Rosewater toner I purchased off of amazon as well and follow up with an extra hydrating cream. (I currently use Keihl's Ultra Face Moisturizer). I use it 4-6 times a month depending on how my face is doing with hormonal breakouts or the occasional pimple. It does pull everything to the surface and detox your face so you may notice new pimple growth afterward but it's only because it is removing pimples which were growing anyways. If you use it again the next day or day after it will help dry them out and keep the skin clear. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Also, after using this for a few months my sister discovered it at home and is addicted to using it too! And my mother wanted in on the mask after seeing us use it and now she makes it for herself as well! Not to mention other family members who have tried it after hearing about it and purchasing it for themselves.	2015-08-02

I am typically fair-skinned but this summer I've been tanning a lot. I've always loved BareMinerals but I wasn't sure which color to choose.

It reduces my redness while still looking very natural and not caked on. I'm very happy with the color. And as always, I love the light feel of BareMinerals.	2015-08-02

A little goes a long way, just one drop per eye is plenty. I did feel a firming/tightening effect after 10 minutes or so. It absorbs very quickly, not oily or sticky, maybe a slightly cool refreshing feeling. I have used it for a few days now, morning and night and decided I really do like it. Eyes are brighter, firmed up a bit, I am 55 and also starting to get very small lines on upper lips just enough it bugs me if I see makeup settling in them, so I got the bright idea, &#34;if it works on my eyes, why won't it work on my lips too&#34;? I have put a drop on my upper lip morning and night the last couple days and I am noticing an improvement there also and this area has never been treated with anything before except moisturizer and maybe occasional serum of it made it above my upper lip. The ingredients are top notch, Hyaluronic Acid, vitamins C and E, Retinol, Organic Aloe Vera, Raw Manuka Honey and Australian Cehami. I have never heard of Cehami before, but I can attest to the fact that Raw Mankua Honey is one on the best repairing, healing and soothing ingredients you can use and it is over half way up that ingredient list so I am sold.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

And initially, I loved it. The scent is lovely (and didn't morph into a grosser, sweat-laced version as the day wore on), and it controlled wetness pretty well. But after a few days of consistent use, I started developing a nasty rash accompanied with a mild burning sensation. I've decreased how much/often I use and have started to moisturize my arm pits - as their website recommends when cases like this arise - but the rash isn't going down without a fight. I unfortunately experienced the same problem with Tom's Apricot deodorant, and after comparing ingredients in the two, have discovered I most likely have a sensitivity to baking soda as a topical in that area. So if you're a sensitive-skinned person like myself, I'd advise trying a sample if you can get your hands on a little before dropping $11 on this guy, or going with a baking soda-free alternative.	2015-08-02

My daughter has VERY CURLY hair. I used this brush to see if it would straighten it, and it did a good job. All I did was put her hair into sections, apply a light oil, and brushed each section just like I would with a regular brush. I have used a flat iron on her head before and using this product is a much better experience.<br />This is why I prefer this over a flat iron:<br />-When I used the flat iron, I had to use a brush with it which took more time and my daughter would become very impatient. With this, I'm brushing her hair as it is being straightened, so there is no need for one.<br />-It doesn't give off that awful burning smell that flat irons sometimes give off as if it is burning you hair away.<br />-It doesn't make my daughter's hair &#34;stick straight&#34;. When I would use a flat iron, it would create a type of &#34;stiffness&#34; in her hair with no volume. Because of the way that this product is made, It make her hair look more &#34;flowy&#34; and &#34;light weight&#34;.<br />-NO CREASES LEFT IN HAIR! Because of the &#34;box shape&#34; of flat irons, the high heat that my daughter's hair requires and having to go somewhat slowly down each section of hair, lots of flat irons would leave creases throughout her hair. This product left no creases in her hair.<br />On the left side, you will see my daughter's natural and very curly hair. On the right, I used the hair brush straightener. I give this product two thumbs up!<br />*UPDATE* As this product does work very well to straighten hair, I have noticed a change in my daughter's hair as to how straight her hair stays after straightening it with this brush now. I was conditioning her hair with a good &#34;protein conditioner&#34; when I first started using this product and her hair would stay straighten at least two days. After switching her to a more moisturizing conditioner, I noticed that her hair did not stay as straightened. Her hair began to go back curly about 10 hrs later. So, as this product does straighten well, I would test it out with a few conditioners before trying to wear your hair straight for a  couple days or only use this product if you're looking for a quick way to straighten your hair for only the day or if you don't mind going back and lightly restraightening it everyday. Hope this helps!<br />I received this product for a honest evaluation and review.curly about 10 hrs later.

This is a really good item for the price. I've owned mine for a year now and it's still going strong. I can reliably trim my beard down to stubble. It should be noted however that it can't really trim any further than stubble. If you're planning on getting it to replace being able to shave down to the skin, this isn't the right product. But otherwise, it's very nice. It trims very easily, and very quick. Definitely beats the heck out of shaving! The only real complaint I have about this product is that hair tends to get all over the place after using it. However, it's a fairly easy clean up, and not that big of a deal.	2015-08-02

I'm sure it varies from person to person, but I've found this to consistently give me a bronze, not orange, glow. I've been using this product for years now, and I can't tell you the number of times someone (usually someone who claims they hate fake tans) has complimented me on my fabulous natural tan! It's the only self tanner I've ever used that consistently fools people into thinking I tan the old fashioned way.<br /><br />Other than the natural color, the best part is how quickly it dries. I usually give it 10 minutes before I get dressed, but I do recommend tanning in the evening before bed for the best results so the tan can set overnight. (Fair warning: be prepared to stain a set of sheets. I finally bought a set of dark colored sheets, which takes care of the problem, but not before ruining a set of light colored ones first.)	2015-08-02

Like all sunscreens it has positives and negatives.  Positive is that it is natural and more healthy than some.  When compared to other natural sunscreens it applies easier.  This is probably what also causes the negative - easy to rub off.  I suspect it is water resistant if you are setting gently in the water but it is not very &#34;rub&#34; resistant.  We were at a water park and even with reapplication it seems to be rubbed off by touching floats and by the rough water.  It is oily which repels water but it is lightweight so it does rub off easily.  I prefer a heavier product (which would be more difficult to apply) and may resort to a chemical sunscreen (with zinc/titanium overcoat) for water parks in the future.	2015-08-02

I have heard so many positive comments about castor oil that I just had to have one in hand! I want to use it mainly on my hair and whatever else it may help with. The smell is pretty unique, it doesn't smell all that great but it doesn't badly smell niether. As of now I can' t say how this is working because am a newbie to this, but i' ll keep posting. I would use this on my eyelashes as I heard it helps them grow but am skeptical on that one since I know it' ll probably burn my eyes badly if applied incorrectly. I can't wait for some results though! One other thing, this oil is thick so when applying to the hair make sure not to pour to much of it just 2 drops at most.	2015-08-02

I used this conditioner years ago when I was able to purchase it through my salon.

I love how as soon as I apply it, my hair feels like butter.  I have very little hair on my comb when I comb through my hair with using this conditioner.<br />It never leaves my hair greasy or dull.  Always very manageable and full of shine.<br />I have a lot more gray now than when I used this year's prior.  I have to say it does the same great job.  And that is really hard to find in hair products today.  Colored, bleached, permed hair all require good quality products to replenish the moisture and bounce to your hair.  Senscience will not disappoint, I promise!!  This is a keeper!!	2015-08-02

I also notice that i had a couple of sparse spots throughout my eyebrows do to playing with my dogs and getting scratched on the eyebrow. I have heard a lot about this brand and how popular it was but never got around to buying it, even though it is available at target. Let me tell you, this brow kit is literally everything. It has 4 different shades that you can mix to make your own custom color to match your eyebrows. It is not too dark, but does give the perfect amount of color to build your brows to look natural. It lasts all day and you do not need to touch it up, and i live in Florida so it is always hot and humid so i have had makeup wear off within hours and this doesn't move. Also it stays put in the shower so you have to make sure you use extra makeup remover to remove it. Great product and i am amazed by its quality.	2015-08-02

The product was not the same as the picture.  It was all in a different language so was unsure how to apply.  I also like being able to read packaging on new products.  Honestly will probably never use this product or order anymore of it.  I tried it once and it caused my eyes to get really itchy.  By the end of the night I had makeup all over my face.	2015-08-02

I need a deodorant that can keep up because I don't have time to stop and freshen up.  A couple clicks and two quick rubs under each arm and I'm good for the whole day. (And I have some really long days...)<br />Two hours a day, I'm watching my son in his JiuJitsu classes in a gym without air conditioning in the heat of the summer.  Running from BJJ to drum lessons to piano lessons and trying to cram my own job in there is time consuming and stressful.  Secret clinical strength is what I've always needed and never knew about.  I don't know what I did before, but I'm not going back.  It keeps me dry and smelling fresh so I can get on with life.  I'd totally recommend this product!!<br />I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.  All opinions are my own.	2015-08-02

This color, Birthday Suit, is very thin and even two heavy coats look very streaky. I topped it with the gel top coat, and it was mostly OK for a couple days. Had one chip, but that was a problem with the edge on my nail. But the color is almost white, and it was so streaky I took it off before I was able to evaluate durability and longevity.<br /><br />I found a better color, Per-Suede, and two coats of that are nice and solid. Still in the early hours of application so time will tell if it actually wears longer than regular polish. For me, that would be anything over three days and I'll be happy.	2015-08-02

So I ordered this Aloe Vera gel before going to Hawaii, because I knew that no matter how much sunscreen I put on, I would still burn. I was really impressed with this Aloe Vera. I got some really bad sunburns but they healed very quickly after using this on them. When I went to the Bahamas a few years ago I used a more commercial aloe vera and my burns did not heal nearly as quickly.<br /><br />My husband complained that it didn't look green like the other aloe vera we had until I showed him that the other one was only green because it had artificial color in it.

I love glitter, but now that i'm a little (tiny) bit older I want a glitter that isn't so big and for lack of a better term 'in your face'. I saw this at a Natural Grocer in omaha, i tried up the tester and decided to buy it, but it was out of stock! So I went over here to Amazon where everything is always in stock and bought it right away for a much better price!<br /><br />For a better idea of the particle size i uploaded a picture of it applied to the back of my hand, the Larenim eye color is the smaller particles, with the larger particles being your standard face makeup fine glitter. The Larenim is MUCH finer yet still glittery-like, and not at all like those opalescent or metallic eyeshadows, this is just fine sparkle in a cool or neutral silver tone.	2015-08-02

Most people are probably going to fall into one of two categories when it comes to products like this … A) those who believe they need individual specially formulated “products” for each act of self-grooming, i.e. soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, deodorant, perfumes, and so on … and B) people who don’t really care. I’ve found I am leaning more and more to the second category. I have to ask is there really that much fundamental difference between some of the products I use?<br /><br />After all, it is pretty well accepted these days to combine shampoo with conditioner, right? Why not use the same product as a body wash? And most bath soaps advertise that they have deodorant properties, so why not combine that feature as well?<br /><br />I like the feel and fragrance of Axe products and I have used some of their similar products before, in fact before ordering this bottle I have been using one Axe product as both shampoo and conditioner and from time to time I’ve used it as a body wash with good results.<br /><br />So I like the idea … less packaging waste, less choices to make, less clashing of fragrances, and less waste. I like that the “Total Fresh” fragrance doesn’t make me smell like I fell into a tank of perfume … it is clean and goes with pretty much any occasion, such as work, visiting friends, or an evening out to dinner.<br /><br />The bottom line is that cosmetics are highly personal. Whether someone here rates this product as 5-star or 1-star really doesn’t mean a thing if you don’t like it, does it? So my suggestion is that if you fit into Category B described above go ahead and get a bottle of this and try it for yourself. I can’t think of anything at all negative about it (like it doesn’t eat your skin away or turn you green or clog your drains).<br /><br />If you like it, note that one of the reasons I rated it highly is that it is being sold at a fair price, not the lowest but then again Axe is a major brand name.	2015-08-02

Put the salve on a couple of times a day for 2 days and it was much improved, now 5 days of using it and I am ordering more. It has helped where nothing else has for a year of applying one skin thing after another.	2015-08-02

I absolutely LOVED it! I never had to worry about breakouts or uneven skin texture - which was a huge deal for me as I've dealt with breakouts since I was a teenager. Sadly, Jai (my friend from Jamaica), decided to move back to his native country - and I was left without a black soap &#34;dealer&#34;.<br /><br />Being that i'd never heard of black soap before he and I were friends, I didn't know it was available to purchase. I'd never seen it in stores so I figured I was out of luck... until the magical moment I discovered it (in solid form) for sale by my favorite skincare company! Had I seen it sooner, you can bet your booty that I would have ordered it before now!<br /><br />As others have stated, it's very &#34;homemade&#34; looking. That's a BIG positive for me. No gimmicks, no frill. There's no need for it. What they have here, is a quality product - and a LOT of it!<br /><br />If you're looking at the price and thinking, &#34;why would I pay $10-$18&#34; for a bar a soap&#34;, keep reading...<br /><br />1. Completely obliterates acne on all skin types<br />2. It's made with all natural ingredients! No perfumes or fillers, just honest to goodness, REAL ingredients.<br />3. It's MASSIVE! This isn't some rinky-dink portion. In fact, I was just telling my husband that I would gladly pay $30 for the amount of black soap you actually get. It's SO much, that I cut it up into 60 pieces. Each piece lasts me about 10 uses. That's 600 uses, WOWZA!<br /><br />Once you receive your order, you'll see why I opted to cut mine into piece. It's easier to handle, and you don't get the whole thing wet when all you need is a little bit. It really does go long way.<br /><br />The lather is incredible (so rich and creamy). It's really a win/win. Your face gets this amazing spa-like treatment (which effectively rids you of breakouts), while your hands are moisturized and rejuvenated.<br /><br />There's a reason I adore Cleopatra's Choice. Every single product I have ever purchased from them, has been phenomenal.<br /><br />I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review, but my opinions have in no way been swayed.

It's really just three Axe items sold together. One of the deodorants has a clever twist lock to prevent accidental spraying when it's stored while traveling.

Best for Exfoliating Dry Skin, Dry Brushing & Full Body Skin Cleansing - Upscale Today!	Beauty	5	46	47	N	Y	A Premium High Quality Bath Body Brush That Is Built To Last!	[[VIDEOID:388ee7cb1880cba7a06f243590e816c1]]Let me start off by saying that I go through several body brushes every year.  The main issue? The bristles either fall out or handle falls off.  Usually within the first week or two of use!  This Bath Body Brush by Reg&ouml;ra is not like the others I have bought at the pharmacy store.  Out of the box I could tell this brush was extremely well made.  I did a tension stress test on the bristles by pulling very hard on them one by one.  Not one bristle fell out!  That right there told me this brush was well designed and built to last.  The other thing I did was pull tightly on the handle.  The tongue and groove design often found on wooden handle body brushes usually don't hold up very well and can easily be pulled out.  The handle on this brush did not budge at all.  No wiggling or anything.  I am truly impressed!<br /><br />The handle has a nice rubber texturized grip which is perfect for when your hands are all soapy in the bath or shower and you are using body wash or other soap...the brush will not slip out of your hands.  There is a nice comfortable handle attached to the main brush for extra convenience.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with this body brush and the Reg&ouml;ra brand!<br /><br />****UPDATE**** 8/23/2015<br /><br />Previously I had stated that the brush and handle seemed to be tightly in place. I know that this brush had the feature of being able to detach from the handle, but to be honest didn't think of it because I have owned many other brushes where the handle is too easily detachable and makes the brush nearly useless.  However, recently I wanted to use the brush for my feet, and the handle was cumbersome so I wanted to detach it.  I noticed that others have had similar issues so here is a video on how to safely detach it without damaging the strap or brush.  The video is short, but it shows that if you firmly grasp the main brush and wiggle it and pull out the handle at the same time, it does remove.  After the first time it isn't so hard to detach, it's just the initial detaching that is a bit snug.  Hope this helps!es remove.

When I purchased this item I was expecting to receive a cheaper apron with not so good quality. I also expected that when I were to get the apron and use it as it folded in half that the apron not to look so good or easily fold. But with this product it was just the opposite. The apron is made with great strong material. When you cut hair the hair just falls off the apron and does not get stuck on it. When you fold the apron in half, it folds very easily and looks very nice like the apron is supposed to be in half. I am so in love with this apron. It was one of the best purchase I have made. It is so nice I use it for more than cutting hair. I definitely recommend this apron who is looking for a nice one!	2015-08-02

I would have given this lip stain 5 stars, except for 2 reasons.<br />1-Dries out your lips a bit<br />2-applicator dries up quite a bit after the first week or so of use (despite storing it with the tip facing down as directed)<br /><br />Love the color and the staying power is considerably longer than other lipstains like covergirl, revlon ect.<br />It is very easy to apply and doesn't feather or transfer.<br />I really wanted this one to be the last one I tried out, but I am now trying Mehru lipstains because this one dried out too quickly imo. It's still usable, but the color becomes much lighter and thus stains less as time goes on.	2015-08-02

Will update my review after my wedding when I will have had the extensions for 2 months and let you know how the hair held up. But they took dye well and are soft and true to length, but they are a little thin at the tips.  Update: Aug 10, when I ran a flat iron through them the first time the bottom inch got a little frazzled. I'd recommend treating these with Olaplex and joico kpak intensive restructuring treatment. That fixed the issue straight away. But I also soaked them in a hot coconut oil treatment. The platinum frazzled way worse and joico kpak + olaplex saved me from cutting 2 inches off of these.	2015-08-02

I am so sorry I have run out of it.  I am on a cosmetics and skincare &#34;no buy&#34; right now but as soon as that is over, I am getting more of this.<br /><br />I use scrubs often and this one has been gentle enough to use daily.  I focus on areas of rough skin, particularly my upper arms.  The concentration of scrubbing particles is perfect and the cream formulation keeps them on your skin (and working) for longer.  They don't rinse off down the drain until you actively try to rinse them off.  A side effect of this is that you don't have to use a ton of this at once, so the container lasts a long time.<br /><br />This smells heavenly.  Of course I love anything almond scented.  I love that it doesn't contain any plastic like some other scrubs I've used lately (exfoliation comes from volcanic stone and sugar, and you can see the ingredients list a bit down on the product page).<br /><br />I rarely gush about products.  But this is seriously one of my favorite discoveries this year (random purchase with Birchbox points).	2015-08-02

I have a basic set from the 1960s made in the USA that I've had for over 35 years now that actually out perform these. I might be inclined to try one of the less expensive clippers sets and I'm guessing that other than the traction from the inlay on these I might be just as happy with the leverage and cut.	2015-08-02

User error or product lacking, but not all cleansers, in fact most of them, do not clean my face as completely as needed the first time. Just look at the towel after you wash your face..how can there still be makeup on the towel?<br /><br />This is where toners come into your cleansing routine. Toners are used to remove any makeup and dirt after you can cleaned your face with a cleanser. Using a toner will help to soften the skin and clean off any soap residue that was not dissolved by rinsing, along with any remaining makeup left on your face.<br /><br />Since using the toner along with my other daily skincare products (cleanser, serum, and a moisturizer) I have noticed a difference in the feel and look of my skin. Even in my mid-fifties I suffer  from an occasionally flare-up of blemishes.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.	2015-08-02

The coverage was decent compared to other foundations I've used - my blemishes and under-eye circles were clearly diminished. It was also a little thicker/tackier than other foundations when I first started putting in on my face, but once I had blended it in, it didn't feel heavy or uncomfortable.

I have dry skin, and several dry patches on my face and I'm hoping this will help. I've only used this for about a couple days, so it's still a little early to tell, but it did leave my face feeling clean, and didn't leave any sticky residue behind. If you have super dry skin like I do, then I would still recommend following up with a moisturizer after using this. So far, I am really liking this product. I also like the fact that it is Certified Organic and made in the U.S.A. i did receive this item for free however all opinions are 100% my own.	2015-08-02

It goes on light, very smooth and you only need one pump to do your entire face. I loved that I didn’t need a lot to cover my face. The first time I put it on I wasn’t sure I was going to like it.  After applying the cream to my face, it felt greasy but not even a minute later when I felt my skin, the greasy feeling was gone.  There is also a light scent to it. In the beginning I wasn’t sure I liked it but over the past few days it is definitely growing on me.  Overall I am pleasantly pleased with this cream and definitely y will continue to use it daily.

I have probably used every single shave gel or cream made in recent memory and this is hands-down the best stuff.  Not only does it provide an exceptionally close shave with minimal irritation, but it also washes out of the razor with almost no effort.  The last quality is very important and has disqualified Billy Jealous and Harry's shave creams: they both hold on to that razor for dear life making my shave routine all the more time consuming.  The cream also has a pleasant scent which, although isn't essential, makes the process slightly more pleasant.<br /><br />I cannot speak highly enough of this stuff.  Try it: you will see that it works wonders and the price is very reasonable for the number of shaves per tub.	2015-08-02

This time around though- I got a fake item, it fit the bill of a fake exactly as people said online- text on bottle was darker than authentic product, spritzer blasted a much larger spray as opposed to a fine mist, scent was similar but not the same and only lasted 20-30 minutes. Luckily Amazon's customer service rocks and I was given a full refund without having to ship the item back. The other cologne I ordered at the same time (versace eros scent) was legit however, so I guess it's just a crapshoot when ordering scents online.	2015-08-02

I have read somewhere before that pine essential oil is one of those oils that are frequently adulterated and Turpentine is used as an inexpensive filler. That sounds scary, right? Plant Therapy gives me a peace of mine that the oil I am using is One hundred percent certified pure therapeutic grade essential oil. It has no fillers, additives, bases or carriers added.<br /><br />Pine essential oil is a very relaxing oil It is great for after exercising. But never use it without a carrier oil because the skin can get irritated.<br /><br />This pine is also great for diffusing. It gives out a very relaxing scent.<br /><br />This pine essential oil is also great to make a home made gel air freshener. Just go get you a unflavored gelatine, water and some salt, then add some of this essential oil, and you will have your very own home made gel freshener (pls. use google for recipes).<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy that I was choosen to test and review this pine essential oil. I can really say that it's a very high quality oil. Plant therapy has not failed me yet. I am so far very impressed with their oils and I highly recommend it to all of my family and friends.	2015-08-02

It shaves closer than my Gillette fusion	This shaver is great! It shaves closer than my Gillette fusion. Some spots you have to go over more than others but it is a quick shave and the self cleaner is great although it does take a very long time. I always hated electric razors because they would cut my neck this one does not have this issue. I believe it has the fastest motor on the market. The only issue I have is it shaves so close that I develope ingrown hairs on my chin and the sides of my mouth. I am 36 and looked like a 16 year old after I shaved. After 2 months of use, I do switch and use the Gillette every other time to help the ingrown hair problem it is not nearly as bad. It definitely takes a little time for your face to adjust. I have to shave often and it really is unbelievable how soft my face is after using this razor. It is expensive but when you consider an 8 pack of Gillette blades are about 40 dollars it will pay for itself in a couple years. I'd highly recommend this razor.	2015-08-02

I also have sensitive skin and break out in red blotches that itch like crazy when my skin doesn't like what is applied.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about this product only because I had never tried it. I am familiar with the brand and because I like their other products I was willing to give this product a try.<br /><br />Wow..it smells wonderful! It applies smoothly and is completely absorbed without any residual greasy feeling. I like that I can apply my makeup right after using this and it doesn't slow down my morning routine.<br /><br />More importantly, I have been applying a little of this lotion on my elbows and can't believe the change in just a short time. My elbows crack and are rough feeling. Just a tab of this lotion applied in the morning and just before bed is making a huge difference in the skin. I would recommend it just for your elbows!<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the product and will continue to use it...both on my face and on my elbows.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.	2015-08-02

I often joke that I can look at a picture of the sun and burn. In reality - all it takes is 20 minutes in direct sunlight for me to go home with a slight sunburn. So you can imagine that sunscreen is extremely important to me - especially when I am swimming the day away. I've had my bottle for quite some time and have never burned while using this. Just a few weeks ago I went swimming at a friend's house for a couple of hours and slathered this on about 30 minutes before I went swimming. I didn't reapply and did not burn. I find that giving my skin time to absorb the sunscreen allows it to work better if I am going to be in water.	2015-08-02

The curler itself works well. It beeps at you if you put in too much hair (for me about 1 inch width is the max). I have long straight thick hair and it curls it well, though some curls have to be redone by the time I am done. It takes approximately 35-40 minutes to curl all my hair, pinning it up and curling it by layers. I use Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner and the oils in these do not cause my hair to burn. It is virtually impossible to burn yourself with it unlike regular hair wand curlers, and this doesn't entail wrapping or twisting. My hair got stuck a few times but it was easy to ease it out and did not get split or cut up.  I use organic sweet almond oil as frizz control and heat protectant with this curler, and I have heard that avocado oil works well as heat protectant with it too. I haven't needed a hair spray to hold the curls, though I recommend Herbal Essence flexible hold hair spray because of its ingredients.	2015-08-02

I got tired of buying them so I thought I'd try these. They're for the most part decent... They are pretty flimsy and a bit difficult to put on (I have medium /long thick hair), but they get the job done.<br />At first I was like &#34;do I really need 100???&#34;, but for the price I don't have to worry about buying any for quite some time. Especially since I could use the same one 3 times a week.<br />I'm finding other uses for them like putting them on my shoes when I pack for trips (putting on hotel tv remote for that matter), or putting it on my iPad when I need to read recipes while cooking but my hands are messy.	2015-08-02

Some Walmarts carry these as well but not all of them. I purchased this on a whim and I can honestly tell the difference when I use this and when I don't. First when you apply it, it's more like a water that kinda seems like it's doing nothing on your face. Well, toners are just to remove dirt on your face after you wash your face anyways. After I wash my face, I let it dry and put a generous amount of toner on cotton ball and swap around my face multiple times gently then put moisturizer. After about using this about a month, my adult acne has improved significantly. I didn't know that it was this toner up until I changed it to something else. The reason I keep buying this is that it is very economical price wise and like the natural ingredients that works on my face.	2015-08-02

I am a longtime user of mineral sunscreen, and this is the worst one I've ever used.  First, the product is extremely greasy and oily coming out of the package.  It almost seems like pure oil.  I suspect that it separates inside the bottle, and that might be why it doesn't work well.  Because it definitely does not work--my very fair family all got lightly burned within 1 hour using this sunscreen at a non-water non-sweaty activity.  I'd say the protection it gives is approximately like a typical spf 5 &#34;suntan lotion&#34;.  Nothing like a SPF 30 block should be!  I'm thankful that we did a trial run at a short activity, because a day at the beach could have ended us up at the doctor if Honest Company was all we had to rely on!<br /><br />Most mineral sunscreens have downsides, the most effective ones being very thick and leaving your whole skin with a whitish cast.  I think the happy medium for me is Mexitan spf 30.  perfect ingredient list, decent results, workably thin consistency so it doesn't take all day to lotion up.  At first glance this seemed like a better deal, but both bottles are going in the trash.  I can pay twenty bucks for a huge 8 ounce bottle that lasts all summer if I know it will protect my family.	2015-08-02

US	8291502	R5NX8DPM1YTOF	B00UR6HH5I	261024182	The Honest Company Honest Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 2-pack 3.0oz	Beauty	4	3	6	N	N	Not a single sunburn for a super pale family	I'm rather suspicious of all the people who've claimed they got horrible burns even when using this. Not like they are liars, but maybe they didn't actually know how to apply physical sunscreens- they don't work the same way as your name brand chemically sunscreens at all. First of all, this is a physical sunscreen, not the scary chemical kind. Physical sunscreens require that you put a thick layer on- you can't use a thin veil and think it will do anything. That's true of all natural sunscreen brands, as a matter of fact. Second, and most important for my pale family, you have to actually follow directions. The bottle says you have to reapply every x hours, how can you expect a good result if you never reapply? This sunscreen protected my pale family (so pale my sister mixes the lightest color of foundations with a good amount of goth targeted pure white costume foundation to make it actually match her real skin color) at the beach, the pool, and the amusement park. My sister is severely allergic to most every kind of sunscreen- all mainstream and even most all natural and organic and baby formulations can close up her airways so she can't breathe and swell up her face so she's unrecognizable- and she loves the beach and she's super pale, so we have tried and vetted out 100's of different sunscreens over the years to try to find the perfect brand. This isn't that, because we live in a humid area and it sometimes makes sweat form little droplets on top of my skin instead of letting it evaporate well and that feels really clammy and gross when the air is already syrup, but it works perfectly as a sunscreen and is super moisturizing to the skin so I am definitely keeping it for trips to drier climates, like when I visit Colorado or California or really anywhere besides the South. In other good news, we left a bottle in the car on a day when the asphalt was melting while we went to the amusement park (another was in the pack so we could reapply every now and then) andthe bottle didn't become gross and liquidy like name brand chemical lotions do- Banana Boat, Coppertone, and the like get gross and melty in the sun, which is ridiculous considering it is made to be used in the Summer when it gets hot, and also because it's chemically so the whole world of nonmelting ingredients is open to them- but anyways Honest sunscreen doesn't get gross in the bottle, it also doesn't feel super cold when you put it on like other brands do, it works for super pale people with infrequent reapplication (5-8 hours though that's beyond bottle recommended time) in thick layers but it didn't look stark white once we rubbed it in, and it left my arms so incredibly and wonderfully smooth and moisturized. It does rub off a little bit once it's first applied though so a little bit got on the back of the leather car seats from my shoulder, so put a towel there or something if it bothers you.	2015-08-02

I just assumed I was average, whatever that was.  So I chose these as they were in the middle of sharpness from less to more.  You can spend more to get much sharper blades.<br /><br />Since I was new to shaving this way I had to make a guess.  I wish I had asked my barber, because as it turns out he would know, right?  I am light complected with light hair on arms and face.  That does NOT mean I don't have a coarse beard.  These blades just don't cut it well, and I have to shave twice.  Barber tells me that relative to hundreds of dudes he's felt their face that mine is fairly coarse so I'll have to find a sharper blade.  I have to use way too much pressure to get these to cut, so next time instead of 100 pack I'll order a variety pack to be sure of what type I need.<br /><br />Blade lasts about 4 shaves, shaving twice each time, before I feel I need to replace.	2015-08-02

This was my first go with &#34;biodegradable&#34; sunscreen and I really wasn't sure what to expect. Compared to other sunscreen, the biggest difference is the texture. This is a bit thinner in consistency and once rubbed in, this feels a lot more light weight and refreshing on the skin! None of that oily, greasy, or waxy feeling. After a few more minutes, it feel like nothing. I especially like the way this feels on my face, since traditional sunscreen tends to give me and a lot of others pimples! I thought the sport bottle type lid was also really convenient, too! I received a small discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-02

I am a woman with very fragile hair and after doing some research learned that wooden combs are better for the hair than plastic combs. So originally I bought one from ebay that I loved but eventually one of the teeth broke so I searched for a replacement.  That's when I found this one.  It is so much stronger and sturdier than my previous comb. I also like that it has closely spaced teeth on one side and wider spaced teeth on the other.  Now my teenage son uses it and won't use anything else.  Worth every penny.	2015-08-02

It's a bit cumbersome, although certainly not hard, to change blades on this handle.  Also, and I have no idea on earth why, but I can put a brand new blade in this razor handle and one side will shave better than the other.  I switched out to another brand new blade, same issue.  I cannot be certain, but perhaps it's slightly off on one side? Would take a micrometer to know I suppose.<br /><br />I like the weight and it's quality, but would rather have something different.  It's how we learn I suppose.  It taught me one thing - this is the only way I'll shave from here on out, or until they invite a lazer scaple like on Star Trek.	2015-08-02

It's delightful woodsy minty scent is every bit as lovely as the rosemary I clipped from my garden but even more powerful, so this 10ml bottle should last me a while since I don't need to use as much of this in my home made cream and shampoo as I used to use with the brands I bought before.<br /><br />This Av&iacute;an' Botanicals Rosemary Essential Oil is 100% pure, undiluted, not combined with carrier oils or any other extender, is highly concentrated, and comes with a dropper so it's easy to measure out the exact amount of drops you need. It's perfect for adding to my home made whipped Shea Butter skin cream, because Rosemary is a powerful antioxidant with the same free radical fighting power as goji berries!  Here's my recipe for those of you interested in making your own all natural anti-aging moisturizer cream as well:<br /><br />Whipped Shea Butter Lotion<br />4 oz. Pure raw unrefined organic shea butter<br />2 Tbsp Fractionated Coconut Oil<br />7 drops of Carrot Essential Oil<br />7 drops of Av&iacute;ano Botanicals Rosemary Essential Oil<br />Mixing Bowl - (I use my Ninja to mix and whip rather than a bowl and hand mixer)<br />Mixer<br />2 clean and empty 4 oz jars with lid liners<br /><br />How to make it:<br />1. Have Raw Unrefined Shea Butter at room temperature (Do not melt or heat it!)<br />2. Measure 4oz and add that to Ninja and pulse - (or to a bowl - if done in a bowl mash it with a fork like you would whipped potatoes)<br />3. Add 2 Tbsp  Fractionated Coconut Oil & pulse (or mash) a little more<br />4. Blend in Ninda for approx. 2 minutes (or mix on high speed for about 5 minutes if doing in bowl) until mixture is creamy and well blended<br />5. Put whipped lotion into clean jars and close. Store in clean, dry, dark and cool place. Room temperature is generally fine.<br /><br />Besides being high in antioxidants, Rosemary Essential Oil natural carnosol which lower DHT and improves hair growth. Regular use of rosemary oil helps to stimulate follicles, making hair grow longer and stronger.  You can use this therapeutic grade premium Rosemary as an additive to you shampoo, conditioner, as a scalp treatment, a leave in conditioner, or use it to make your own shampoo.<br /><br />Here's a recipe for a lovely Rosemary Peppermint Shampoo that makes 8 ounces.<br />•6 oz Aloe Vera Gel<br />•3 Tbsp Olive Oil<br />•10 Tbsp Baking Soda<br />•20 drops Rosemary Oil<br />•10 drops Peppermint Oil<br /><br />You can experiment with the number of drops you prefer, the carrier oil,  and even change the Peppermint out for a different essential oil if you prefer. Rosemary combines well with frankincense, lavender, clary sage, cedarwood, basil, thyme, citronella, lemongrass, elemi, geranium, chamomile, peppermint and cardamom.  Promotional discount received for evaluation and review purposes. My review is based entirely on my own opinions formed by using this Rosemary Essential Oil in order to evaluate and test it. I'm diffusing several drops combined with Lavender Essential Oil as I write this review, and it smells wonderful.

It is a lovely dark shade with lot's of sparkle, but the sparkle is small enough to not be overwhelming and comes more off as pearlescent, as the name would suggest. Great application, the applicators in this line are great for precise and perfect lining, as you are able to apply! Good formula doesn't cake and has a ball in the bottle so you can give it a good shake before using! I have been using mine for a few months on and off and still have plenty left! I like the Black Pearl as compared to the Raven because it has the pearlescent quality; the raven could get a bit cakey and was very dry, but it is meant to be a matte finish. For anyone looking for a new black liquid liner, I would really have to recommend! It's vegan and very natural, and it has a great price! I never have to reapply, and when I want to take it off, I just use some oil and water, and it comes off very easily. My favorite!	2015-08-02

The other half bought this specifically for a tampon case. She wanted something she could toss in an overnight, gym, or carry on bag and have all of her 'monthly needs' met. While she wasn't thrilled about the material at first (it's  rather shiny nylon build,) the plush woven hex cross pattern adds a little more luxury to the case, overall. It's actually quite spacious. Jenna used some felt and a fabric pen to give it a little tongue and cheek face-lift to suit her style.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*Decent size- Holds 20 regular (non compact) size tampons with room for personal wipes and a few thin pads. Despite the lining of the case being plush, the weight of the case is almost non existent and it very easily stashes away.<br /><br />*This case stands up on it's own, with a flat bottomed design.<br /><br />*The zipper has held up over a considerable amount of use over several months and seems to close securely. We like that the zipper color matches the bag, itself.<br /><br />*There is a little loop on one end to tether it to a larger cosmetics case, or simply grab with a few fingers and go.<br /><br />*The material is very easy to clean and resistant to makeup smudges.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*This is a soft case- do not expect it to protect your valuables, and we would not recommend it for expensive makeup compacts, as it can be crushed.<br /><br />We paid more than the current $5 asking price for this case and still considered it a good deal as it is spacious and very durable with nice stitching.	2015-08-02

The package shows  woman applying it to her hair, but I can't imagine anyone would have the patience to paint her hair with this little brush.<br /><br />But it's almost perfect for beards. 20 seconds in the morning and my gray beard is GONE! A quick touch-up after lunch and I'm young and handsome all day.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars if it were waterproof and if it didn't smudge the collar of my winter coat.

White marks....oh the dreaded white marks!!  They are every woman's worst nightmare when getting dressed in a dress or dark colored shirt.  It is so embarrassing.  But I don't have to deal with that nightmare anymore!  Secret Outlast Xtend Clear Gel Deodorant takes away that worry.  It goes on clear and stays clear.  And I have tried so many other deodorants, just to have to reapply it half way through my day, because the wetness was coming through or the odor protection was wearing off.  But with Secret Outlast, it worked for at least 24 hours without every having to reapply.  I can't wait to try the other scents that are available.  I have finally found a deodorant that works and I can trust. I was given a free sample via BzzAgent to try and this is my truthful opinion based on my experience only.	2015-08-02

Other Anastasia brow products are a better buy.	I really wanted to love this product after reading so many positive reviews on it online and seeing so many makeup bloggers recommend it, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. The color I purchased based upon the info on the Anastasia website should have been a perfect match, but it was WAY too dark. You have to use a very light hand with this product to keep it from getting too dark and too fake looking. But therein lies the rub: the whole concept of a &#34;pomade&#34; is that it is supposed to provide color and control, acting as a brow tint or powder and a control wax. But in order to get the color right with this product I have to use so little that it provides no control and I end up reaching for my trusty NYX wax pencil anyway. Also, it never seems to dry or &#34;set&#34; and several times has rubbed off on chothing when I pull it over my head. The Anastasia double ended brow brush and spoolie is great and the Anastasia brow pencils are totally worth the money, but to me this product is a skip.	2015-08-02

I finally decided to give this a try since the Majestic Pure line has been so good to me. This was an amazing dead sea mud mask. Here are a few things that make it outstanding and a few reasons you should try it if you are looking for this as an option.<br /><br />1) There is no scent.<br />2) It dries within 6 minutes so if you need a quick face mask, this is it.<br />3) It cleans off easily and doesn't leave a residue.<br />4) It does what it says. I noticed within the first use that my pores (which have started to enlarge) were smaller and less noticeable.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you should test this product on your hand or a small patch of skin first. Leave it on for about 5 minutes and make sure you don't have an allergic reaction!<br /><br />I am so happy to have been chosen to try this and give my review to others. Majestic Pure is amazing and their products are always high quality.	2015-08-02

My nails were a bit iffy before, but after they pretty much got worse, and my regular lotion/nail moisturizers didn't seem to be cutting it.<br /><br />I REALLY wish that I took pictures before I started, but my nails would show every singly little crease and crack from spots peeling and whatnot. After the first application, after a few minutes I could feel a few of my nails seemed to tighten. I didn't do the 3 day hydration thing, I'm just doing it intermittently throughout the day when I'm going to be sitting for a while, and I avoid &#34;rubbing&#34; it in (I just feel that everything I put on my nail is just going to get soaked up by my finger!), and after about 30 min~an hour my nails are all soaked up and shiny!<br /><br />After two days now, my nails feel far more stronger than they were. NO more showing of any peeling/cracks, and even on one of my thumb nails where there was a small bit of nail peeling up, has seemed to fuse back down. I will of course be trimming off all the old growth and let the new growth with the help of this oil!<br /><br />So far, so good! I'm certainly impressed with it. I won't be using it VERY much after I get my nails in good shape, maybe a few bare soaks a few times a week, defiantly will pick up some more! :)	2015-08-02

So Creeds are a bit tricky when it comes to grey market. They change their packaging and bottles often and this is probably compounded more due to the fact that most bottles come from the Middle East hence the Arabic insert. With all that said the product I recieved from Amazon seems to be legit. The bottle/packaging has the Batch number of LT3314G01 33 is the number assigned to Millesime Imperial and the 14 is year of production. Another thing Creed is notorious for is batch variation, meaning some batches have more prominent notes than others and some have better or worse longevity. So that why some samples or older bottles may conflict with this purchase. Obviously if it doesn't smell similar then that's a different story but if it overall is similar you're good to go.<br /><br />I get poor longevity from this fragrance (about 3-4 hours) and it doesn't project much. That said it's an amazing fragrance, the sea salt and fruit (I say watermelon like most) create such an intoxicating summer feeling I just wish it lasted longer (I carry a decant for backup). I'd recommend it to both males and females looking for a different type of summer scent that isn't aquatic or citrus based.	2015-08-02

I appreciate products that are more natural than processed, yet I also want to smell great in a non-perfumy way. Lavanila vanilla coconut and the vanilla lavender scents are awesome. The scents remind me of summer days on the beach. I don't feel as though I'm clogging my poors with garbage; it's super light feeling when applied, even liberally. I very much appreciate that Lavanila gives me appropriate coverage so that when I'm at work teaching my first graders, I never worry about being stinky; I always smell approachable. I used to be able to wear Tom's deodorants successfully, but something happened with my body chemistry after two pregnancies and Tom's didn't control my stink anymore! Thanks, Lavanila, for stepping up and helping me out. Totally worth the price. One stick lasts me four months.	2015-08-02

First, they do work...They more than make up for the shortness in one leg that I have to contend with. Second, they are well made and tough. Forget those spongy lifts that will feel great at first but compress over time. I need firm support to avoid stressing my Left hip by compensating for my shortened leg when walking. These put me on an even keel with every stride and eliminates my hip pain completely.  I'm agnostic on the benefits of these lifts being adjustable. Personally, I'd much rather have a solid one piece support that comes in the 3/8 to 5/8 inch (ideal) size that I need. Perhaps they should expand their line of products by offering solid lifts in a variety of sizes.  The problem with these multi-layer adjustable supports is the layers can start to shift by themselves over time. It may take a while but it will eventually happen. It does make me wonder if I wouldn't be better off planing a piece of hard wood or plastic to achieve the same end for a lifetime lift that would never wear out. And a solid lift would be much easier to clean between shoes.  A solid lift would also minimize the mold that tends to form between the layers after months and months of being exposed to your living, breathing and sweating feet all day. Even placed under a foot pad, these lifts will eventually funk up on you. And if, like me, you care to remove them for use in other shoes, these multiple layers will start to loose their natural adhesion and tackiness. Which is another reason they'll start shifting on you over time.  Hence, my rather mediocre rating. Yes, they do work. They feel great when new. And they gave me 2 years of faithful service before giving out.  Maybe expecting a lifetime of service is asking too much. But it wouldn't be a great chore for this company to fuse these layers into a solid form and they jolly well would last a lifetime. Or a decade or more.. I'd pay extra for that kind of dependability. And of course, the sheer utility of being able to use them in a variety of shoes in my closet in a pinch would be a great improvement.	2015-08-02

I've owned three of them over the past ~5 years and can now write a pretty comprehensive review.<br /><br />Let's start with the good. Shaving in the shower is great, and this product makes it super easy. The set up is easy and while it isn't super clear, it works more than well enough to shave with. The company also will send free mounting kits if you decide to move.<br /><br />Now the bad. Over time, the mirror becomes less clear (but still usable.) The tilting mechanism wears out in a few years which is the biggest flaw. Once filled with water, there is no way to position it between the middle setting and the bottom setting without it 'falling'. I contacted ToiletTree and was ignored. Last, it is advertised as removable but be cautious. I've mounted it on tile and twice on plastic. The second time on plastic is bonded so well (and the plastic was so weak) that it ripped a huge hole in the shower wall. My landlord will not be happy.	2015-08-02

I enjoy wearing lashes almost daily, and buying one set can cost 3.48+ anywhere. I went on amazon. I had previously ordered bulk lash sets like this but shipped from China and they were horrible so I was weary about this purchase. But they are great! You can definitely tell that the lashes are artificial by feel, but regardless they look great. As far as staying on I've had no issues with them coming off, and they certainly don't hurt peeling off. It's nice to have the several different styles to change up your look. The box they come in is nice and small. And the sheets they come on help you keep the lashes nice. I would definitely buy more of these.	2015-08-02

The red is 100% true to the picture. It is soft, smooth, and easy to comb though. The wig cap is a little small for me being a grown woman. But for most people I'd assume it fits just as well. The bangs are very long but easily pinned back and the hair looks for the most part very natural. I love the color it's dark and smooth it takes good pictures and doesn't have too much fake shine to it. It's maybe not a daily use wig but it has done very well for me so far. Also the length isn't as long as what I was thinking from the picture but all together it's a great wig and will suit any need! Fast shipping, great seller. I fully recommend trying it for the great price!	2015-08-02

I kept wetting the product using bottled water to keep it active during the 3 minutes, I could be wrong but I think once it stops stinging its not working. It only stings for a few seconds or until dry. Now I am not going to tell you that  &#34;away went my wrinkles and I look 10 years younger&#34; that would be a lie. However my skin was really really soft, smooth, fresh and my fingers too, which I used to apply. So I decided to try it on the tops of my hands the second time and they look really great. Only time will tell if it can do all it claims. I am happy with the results so far. Best of all you do not have to pay the money it would cost at a spa. Want that spa feeling, light some candles, buy some white towels and get your best friend to apply.	2015-08-02

I think the Beauty Blender Cleanser does a great job cleaning my sponges and brushes, but yet I find it so expensive for such tiny product that doesn't last alot. I had read a review that Ivory soap does the same job and I decided to give a try, I had nothing to loose by trying. Ivory Soap cost me $1.89, and it was a 3 pk of soap. I inmediately got home to try it. As soon as I opened it almost smelled exactly the same. I decided to compare both soaps ingredients and to my surprise the ingredients were the same. The Ivory soap left my brushes and sponges sooo clean and the cleaning process was so quick. Definitely do not spend so much money on such tiny soap. IVORY SOAP IS THE BEST! Cheaper, better, and much more product!	2015-08-02

We LOVE this soap and are so happy to have found it on Amazon. My husband has eczema and we have tried many natural soaps and body washes but this, in our experience, has exceeded them all.<br />If used alone, it is a mild exfoliant due to the presence of the sea salt. It's wonderful to have this option in the soap rather than having to rely on another source for exfoliation. When we just want the creamy and abundant suds it provides we use a nylon scrubby. We have found that the bars last much longer with this method since you only need to give the soap a few passes over the scrubby to have more than enough lather to shower with.<br />As it says on the box it is great for shaving. The lather is so creamy! And the smell is divine!! It smells fresh, that's the only way I can describe it, which makes it great for both of us to use. No more multitude of his & her products in our small shower!!<br />If you're looking for a great way to get clean, smell great and avoid the plethora of chemicals found in most shower/bath products give this a try. It also makes a great gift...I'm always tucking one in a gift bag for someone and then I hear 'I love it...where can I buy it?'<br />Enjoy!	2015-08-02

You couldn't find it for a stretch there, and I was buying it from off merchants when I could find it, and now I'm so excited to see that Amazon is selling it again.<br /><br />My hair is naturally what I've long called dirty dishwater strawberry blond and a friend more poetically called the color of honey. It's a reddish dark blond or maybe a light auburn, but isn't a fiery carrot top of any shade. For me, this covers (or disguises?) the gray that's creeping in and kicks up the red a bit.<br /><br />When I was unable to find this and trying to find &#34;my shade&#34; in other brands (hopeless), I was always embarrassed to be near other people just after a coloring because it all stinks so much. Not to mention what the hell am I doing to myself with those harsh chemicals. (For some brands, the included conditioner smells like fake coconut and that's a smell I particularly detest; the conditioner here is more of a neutral scent.)<br /><br />This won't be for everyone because it's not &#34;permanent&#34;, but for me, I like that it gradually fades out and doesn't leave a line with the new growth. And I also like that it doesn't make my hair a monotone color... it adds color and leaves natural variation, and I think the result is very natural looking. For me, I try not to leave it on too long or it ends up a little redder than I'd like most of the time.<br /><br />FWIW, I have very long hair but just use one box. I do all the wrong things and color just after shampooing, so my hair is still wet from that. Plus, of course, the ends don't need much.	2015-08-02

What a piece of junk! The razor is designed all wrong and will not even hold the blade that came with it, making this whole kit completely useless.

Sometimes you get a completely worthless piece of junk like this razor that will not even hold a blade, and you can't even return it for a refund... Well, we've had two other problems as well lately with shipping dates; when we paid extra to get an item delivered anytime for someone's birthday it always comes a day or two late.

The scent is a delightful cranberry with citrus undertones, which is very pleasant but not overwhelming and reminds me of Thanksgiving and happy holidays. The scent lasts just long enough but the moisturizing lasts much longer. I use this primarily as a body lotion after showering, but prefer the matching hand cream for my hands since it is thicker and more moisturizing -- which my dry hands really need, although if your hands are not too dry, this would also be good for routine hand moisturizing.<br /><br />I often use this lotion after a bath with the matching bath soak (which was a disappointing purchase, by the way). This lotion would not work as well for extremely dry skin, like in the winter -- the body butter is better suited for that. Overall, an effective moistuzing lotion, at a good price, especially with the subscribe & save discount. Plus, it is made in Canada of natural ingredients. Highly recommended!	2015-08-02

I bought this with hesitation since I've never used organic,  just the name brands with heavy chemicals and I am a plus size woman.  I am sometimes worried about personal body odor.  This deordant is amazing!!  I was hesitant on the tea tree and lavender.  But they blend so well and smell amazing.  The first week I got it actually my mother though she kept smelling flowers,  no it was this!  I recommend it to anyone.  It comes off without having to use soap in the shower and slides on well without any oily,  powdery residue kite the other brands I've used in the past. It worked great even when it's 106 degrees and I'm picking blackberries.  TRY IT YOU WIL LOVE IT!!	2015-08-02

My wife has been using this product for years, but she does not use it as a straight lipstick, because that really does not work.  So this is what she does: At night, she uses the LIPFUSION XL (she has decided that the XXL is not as good, but the XL is fantastic).  She puts on a heavy coat each night before bed, and that keeps the lips hydrated and plumped (over time you will notice a difference).  For her daytime routine, she uses a lip liner (Urban Decay from Sephora), then a lipstick of choice (she likes Clinque long lasting, but any lipstick will work), and then uses this LipFusion pencil over the lipstick.  It adds color to your lipstick, so you need to figure out how the colors blend, but it provides additional plumping for daytime.  It will not last if you eat, and you will need to reapply.  Overall, the LipFusion pencils are easy to use, soft enough to apply, and come with a sharpener that works well.  A good addition to your daily routine.	2015-08-02

Legs have got to be the hardest surface to shave. With blind spots and curves, not to mention then amount of surface area, the hazards are numerous. I have been shaving 2 months now with no nicks, razor burn, or skin irritation. Rotating blades  give closer shave than foil heads. Five heads cut job down to size. Unique fit on palm of hand allows you to feel as you shave. Do not use on underarm area, that did not fair well. Cleans easy. Charges quickly and works corded as well. Feel this would have worked well even 20 years ago when legs were significantly more hairy. Love it so much I am thinking about purchasing another in case, god forbid, something were to happen to this one. For me, it felt similar to a blade shave without the hassle.	2015-08-02

I use a cotton ball to put this on. I use it at night before my moisturizer, it does not break me out or dry out my skin like other serums. Would recommend this product. I received this product at a discount for an honest review	2015-08-02

It's been about 3 weeks since I have been using it. Already feel a difference in the volume and thickness of the hair improve. However, it may be much to early to see significant difference in hair growth however, I do notice less hair fall out in the shower. Overall very content with the product. I will do an update on the review at the 2 month mark which is when they say, we would see a difference. I don't notice too much of smell when applying the shampoo. Only annoyance is when some of the shampoo slowly trickles down the side of the forehead into the eyes in any amount, it tends to burn and it is hard to prevent streams from forming unless you keep your head back when applying and rinsing.	2015-08-02

I personally still love the deep moisture body wash over this and others, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I like the scent of this body wash. It wasn't too strong and left a nice scent on your skins after a shower/bath. My girls like to use it as a bubble bath product, too.<br /><br />I didn't feel my skin was as soft with this body wash over my Dove deepMoisture body wash. However, I live in a very dry area so for me that is something I look for in my body wash. If you don't live a really dry area, then you might like this a lot.<br /><br />Overall, I think Dove has really good products for those who don't want to or can't afford high end (expensive) body products.	2015-08-02

But if you can get past that, this mask is pretty great bang for your buck.	2015-08-02

I worked on dropping weight, which wasn't too hard. 45 lbs later, I realized that it was not the weight that was as much of an issue as the skin that was left after dropping all the weight. I have been working on toning, but needed a little extra help. I tried out the hot shot gel, and immediately noticed the menthol ish type smell and feel on my skin. The gel is easy to use, you don't need a ton. I spread it all over my belly and waited for it to dry. There was no sticky residue left after, just a very tingly feeling. Almost like I had been working out, then cooling down. The skin already looks better. Over all it is helpful and I can't wait to see how I look in a few months as I keep up with exercising and using my hot shot gel. I love that is'a 87% organic. I would love to see it 100%.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN	2015-08-02

Just remember... your hair does not go back to your natural color, but it does take it back to a nice base so that your new color is more even and natural looking.  I have used this twice a year for a long time.  Color builds up in your hair just like other hair products  So, when you don't like the color or your old reliable color starts looking dull and not lasting as long, this is when it is a good time to use this product.  The first time I used it I was so scared that it was going to turn my hair into straw.  it does not.  It actually makes your hair feel really good.  My hair length is mid-back in length, but very fine.  I highly recommend this product.	2015-08-02

I've been using it just under one month and my husband says that a hereditary dark spot that I have had trouble getting rid of is starting to lighten up. Needless to say, I'm happy. I'd definitely recommend this product. To keep the ingredients &#34;active&#34;, I keep it in the refrigerator.

Lasted for 4 weeks, and it was still on my lashes, but I reapplied after 4 weeks for the new eyelash growth.  Easy to use, does not irritate my eyes at all, washes off skin with just water.  I've been using blue-black, will try black next.<br /><br />Some pointers:<br />-- when you start mixing it, it's all lumpy and separate, seems like it will never blend and mix together properly.  I was sure that I did something wrong.  But after mixing for a few minutes it all blended just fine, just keep mixing.<br />-- the color of the mixture is not what it will look like on your eyelashes.  Mine looked quite purple, I was worried that I will have purple eyelashes.  Nope, the eyelashes came out just fine, black with just a hint of bluishness<br />-- I used vaseline under my eyes the first time I used it, but I think I got some on the tips of my lower lashes and didn't dye the tips.  So the second time I used no vaseline.  the few smudges that I got on my skin came out just fine with a moist q-tip, I don't think there is any need for vaseline<br />-- it comes with a plastic stick wand and a mascara wand, I use both<br /><br />overall, awesome!	2015-08-02

I received this rosehip oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. I am usually impressed with Radha's various products, but this rosehip oil has me thinking and wondering if it truly is rosehip oil. It is a very pale yellow color, and just barely it is very close to clear. Everything I've read in natural beauty and essential oil books say that that rosehip oil should be a rich amber color. Other brands I have are the amber color as well making me wonder why this one is sooo light. It also has absolutely no scent to it at all. The other brands have an earthy scent to them, and the books say that it should have a strong scent. I've marked it down because of the smell and color. The oil itself hasn't irritated my skin at all and I will use it in some of my beauty products I create, but I'm not sure that I would purchase it again because I'm not sure of it being the right oil in the bottle. It is a much larger sized bottle for a lower price than many other brands. The bottle itself is a blue glass and comes with a regular lid. It also comes with a glass dropper lid that you can exchange it for if you prefer droppers for your uses.	2015-08-02

On the website and even in the tube, it looks pretty dark, but it goes on as more of a berry color than purple. I have pale skin, so this color really complemented my complexion. It has a nice, slightly fruity smell and it went on very smoothly. It also didn't feel like I was wearing lipstick - it wasn't heavy or glossy or sticky. I wore it all day at a house party and only had to re-apply once, after eating and wiping my mouth a lot. It never really came off on the glass I was drinking from, nor did it fade throughout the day just from talking - my mouth always gets dry from talking a lot and I find that many other lip colors start to fade away and only stay on the edges of my lips. I will definitely be using this going forward and will likely buy more shades when I'm looking to get more lipstick.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinions.	2015-08-02

I received samples of this last year to do product testing, and I absolutely loved all of it - but I adored the body butter in this scent. Just adored it.<br /><br />Now when a company is going to introduce a product to the market, you'd think that they'd WANT people to buy it. I never saw a company like this one in my life. Emails, Facebook probes, even phone calls, all ignored. Me: &#34;When will you be selling it?&#34; Them: &#34;Uhhhh....&#34; Me: &#34;Where will I be able to buy it?&#34; Them: &#34;Ummmm....&#34;<br /><br />The company is uber artsy-fartsy (though to give them credit, many of their things are beautiful.) I just thought they were trying to make this super exclusive, so that you had to go to a high end story in Manhattan to have a snooty saleswoman decide if she deigned to sell it to you.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I tripped over this on Amazon. Hmmm, snooty, eh? I didn't care. I was going to buy it on Amazon initially, because there were several sellers who were selling it at a good, discounted price. Well, apparently they slumming on Amazon, but not when it came to the PRICE. The initial sellers and their good prices disappeared, and all we've got now are the high end price. Hmmm.<br /><br />Oh, what the heck, I loved the body butter, so I figured I'd go for it (and I did, but not here. I found the discount sales folks, and bought it for a third less.)<br /><br />Now to the product: it is probably the best body butter I've ever used. The scent is utterly unique...it kind of smells like a combination of beach campfire and sea air (yeah, that sounds strange, but this really isn't like any other scent I've ever smelled. it's totally addictive.) The body butter sinks into your skin and moisturizes it for an entire day. Come back in 24 hours, and your skin will feel like you just put it on.<br /><br />Oh, and the frosted glass jar it comes in is gorgeous. The top looks like whitewashed driftwood. The box is also amazing - like I said, whoever does the art for this company has excellent taste. The body butter is amazing stuff, but the entire presentation of it in the jar and the box makes it a gift you'd be thrilled to give to anyone you adore. It really is that good.<br /><br />And that's the other thing that gets me. This body butter IS worth the price they're asking (but of course, who pays full price if they don't have to?) What I don't get is why there are so many suspicious reviews on this. So many reviews from people all in the middle of July, many of them having reviewed nothing BUT this body butter (oh, and the other scent - so why are they reviewing both? They spent $90 on two jars of body butter??) And not one that I've seen actually BOUGHT the body butter from Amazon.<br /><br />You usually get the scammy reviews from dubious sellers with inferior products. This body butter is absolute top of the line. I don't get why they would NEED to sham it. Like I said, it's a really weird company that just happens to make a great product. If you're a skincare junkie like me, you'll be thrilled. It's a five star product, with one off for the exceptional weirdness of the company that makes it.<br /><br />P.S. One other thing: they make a luxurious bar of soap; again, one of the nicest bars of soap I've ever used. It's also being sold on Amazon, and it's also incredibly expensive at two bars for $24; if you google around, you can find it for a lot less (it only comes in two-bar boxes, one bar with this scent, and the peony one.)ewashed driftwood.

I apply it on wet hair that has been mildly towel dried. My hair goes about 3 inches past my shoulder and I only apply one pump the the hair past my ears. This leave-in works well to restyle and shape my hair in the morning especially if I went to sleep with damp hair. I wet the parts that I want to straighten then I shape it with a comb. This leave-in helps my hair hold that shape once it's dry. It's quicker and less damaging than using heat, but I'm not sure this technique would work with thicker hair types/more stubborn hair textures. This stuff also leaves my hair soft and it reduces tangling.<br /><br />The only con is that it you can't really travel with the bottle.	2015-08-02

I want to start this by saying that my experience is not necessarily what your experience will be. If the 5 star reviews are to be trusted, this has worked extremely well for some people.<br /><br />However, it has been worse than ineffective for me. I have been losing hair for 3 years at a steady, but noticeable rate. My scalp was started to really show to the right and left side of my slight widow's peak, along the slope where the top of my head meets the side of my head.<br /><br />I started using Ultrax a few months ago, and I immediately saw a change after using it... within a week, about 25% of my hair had fallen out along this area of my head. My logic to keep with it was that, like monoxidil, caffeine would be increasing the blood flow to my follicles. This can cause hair that is in a certain stage (starved of enough nutrients) to fall out, which will normally then be replaced by new, healthier hair follicles. However, months later, no new hair has grown back.<br /><br />In fact, 50% of the hair that I started with in the aforementioned areas has fallen out. It is my worst nightmare. I've finally stopped it altogether because it is now clear this product is not only NOT helping, but it is making it significantly worse. Basically, if I were to judge my hair loss in the last three years, I'd say that I lost 3 more years of hair in the span of 3 months.<br /><br />I wanted everyone to be aware that... somehow - I don't know how... this product can have the reverse effect of what it is designed to do. I am a health 27 year old male, and am active, and no one on my mother's side of the family has hair-loss issues (supposedly mother's side is where we get hair-loss genes). So I may be the extremely unlucky case here.<br /><br />Just because this happened to me doesn't necessarily mean this will happen to you, and that you shouldn't buy this product. Please don't let me destroy this product for you. But also, please keep my results in mind.	2015-08-02

I prefer to use natural body products whenever possible, but I live in Texas and sweat a lot during the summer. I was looking for something natural that would actually work. This is really expensive for deodorant, but it had good reviews so I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Was effective in smell reduction and had a nice lavender scent.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Left terrible stains on my clothing.<br />Application is very messy. It had the consistency of really thick lotion that took a long time to absorb. I had to wipe my arm-pits after application so it wouldn't get all over everything. I also had to wipe down the rim of the tube as it would get all over the edge.<br /><br />I ended up trying to use this for about a month before giving up and tossing it. Too pricey to have to throw away but I just couldn't do it anymore. I guess I'm back to using men's deodorant during the summer months (because they don't make anything for women that isn't an anti-perspirant).	2015-08-02

I had been using Arbonne Nutrimin C Night Cream for years and liked it, but decided to ditch it mostly because I didn't want to be using anything with retynol (Vit A). I have also tried bottles of whatever is supposedly good housekeeping's best and those failed miserably--not-to-mention they often have toxic ingredients in them. I have also tried other more expensive q10 products. Normally, I don't need that much extra moisture, but I am guilty of over-exfoliating which has reduced freckles but dries my face out. I decided to try this product-- I look up every product on www.ewg.org and this one is just a 2. (Don't buy the one with SPF, it's a 5!) This is exactly what I need! Non-greesey, absorbs quickly, and almost matte finish. I think it slowly helps with fine lines even around my eyes (it may work as well as my Boots 7 eye cream)! I add a drop of rosehip oil to the cream while I'm applying to dilute the rosehip smell and get it on snoothly without the oilslick look. This product has no frangrance! I also noticed that after applying, this product is very soothing to my exfoliated skin and tones down redness or pinkness! I read that in reviews, but didn't realize I had so much skin irritation until it was gone via this product. Anyway, I will buy again. I am using this container quickly. I do wish it came in a tube for sanitary purposes. Order from Amazon-- best prices!	2015-08-02

Laura Geller cosmetics are typically packaged and priced competitively with other high end cosmetics. This was not the case with what should have been a simple transaction.<br />The item arrived loose, without packaging, other than thin plastic wrap. There was no packing slip included. In unwrapping the make-up bag, the tassel came off the zipper in my hand.<br />I didn't want to return the bag, so I tried to rig up the zipper and finally did, without the original tassels.<br />The makeup bag is useful and cute. The Laura Geller name adds a bit toward branding but really isn't recognizable in the script don't used.<br />This bag could have easily been priced higher but the value and potential led me to purchase this particular deal. Although it arrived before expected, I really would have preferred better, or at least some, packaging to protect the item.<br />Disappointed with quality.

I didn't think there was a difference between one nail clipper to another, but I was wrong! When I got these in the mail I used them immediately on myself and on my children. They cut well, which is good, but the most impressive thing for me is that they didn't cause us any pain. When I would trim my kids nails before they would scream, kick, and fight. They would cry for hours afterward and act like it was the end of the world. When trimming their nails with this set there was not one tear, but lots of, &#34;Oh my goodness, Mom! That didn't hurt at all!&#34; Another thing I notice about these compared to other clippers I've used is that they are curved on the end instead of straight and I imagine that has something to do with how easy and pain-free they are to use. After trimming us all up these went directly into my purse to have on hand at all times. I will buy these again for us and plan to buy some as gifts, too!	2015-08-02

I purchased this for my mother for a MRSA lesion on her face, which was verified through a biopsy.  She is 100 years old.  I had used Manuka Honey on the spot at first which was fairly effective, but as I watched the healing process I decided it needed a little more help.  I stopped the honey and began to apply the castor oil with a q-tip and covered it with a band-aid.  This completely healed the skin.  I also had given her 1 turmeric capsule a day to help the immune system.  My original purchase from PurO3 was the sample pack which I enjoyed experimenting with.  I am extremely satisfied with the product quality and the results of usage.<br /><br />I want to add to this review as of September 27, 2016.  I have used myself or suggested it to others for ear infections, herpes in all areas, and cuts. This is a great product!	2015-08-02

So the paint goes on well, and it's nice to practice on because it's kinda child size. However, as you can see by the picture, it doesn't come off well. This picture was taken after an hr of scrubbing. I even tried nail polish remover, to no avail. Kinda disappointing, as it makes it distracting when trying to paint on it again. But it works, if not perfectly, so 3 stars.<br /><br />***after buying magic rub eraser and 91% alcohol***<br />I did try this and it did work. BUT i cleaned about half of the head to see the difference and it took me about 15 mins of hard scrubbing. I'm practicing different looks with face paint, and I'm using high end products (not cheep starter sets) so the paint stains easily. I'm spending 45 mins to try and clean a head just so I can work on it again! Way too much. I suppose I can just rise it and paint again with the stains, so it still does work. That is why I raised it to 4 stars. I can't expect this product to be perfect, and it sure beats making my poor boyfriend's face red with having him try look after look with face paint. So all in all, good product. Not perfect, but good.	2015-08-02

I don't use waterproof makeup, but the product worked great. I wonder if those of you who said it made the makeup smear had just forgotten to shake the bottle first? After sitting around for a while the product will separate in the bottle, mostly water on the top. I used it with a small cotton pad and my eye makeup came off so easy with one swipe. There's always the typical &#34;greasy&#34; feeling after using any eye makeup remover that I've tried, and as always, it comes off easily with warm soapy water, or whatever you use to wash the rest of your face. I'm so happy Amazon had this for a decent price. I would buy this again and recommend it to a friend.	2015-08-02

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	If you like natural this is your tea tree oil!	We live in Alabama.  If you aren't aware the state bird here is the MOSQUITO!  After doing some research I found that tea tree oil helps repel them.  So when I had the opportunity to review this particular product for a small discount I jumped at it.  I was really tired of having to come inside at an early hour because I was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. Well, last night we put it to the test.  My daughter and I seem to be the most hit by the mosquitoes and I put a small amount on my pulse points of my neck and wrists and top of my foot.  I actually made it!  No bug bites.  I am also a big diy person.  I also read where you can put a few drops of tea tree oil with 20-40 drops of witch hazel and make your own acne treatment! I am trying that as well.  Putting a few drops in your shampoo can be a lice repellent.  Also you can use it as a natural way to relieve sunburns.  Trust me when I tell you this is a great product.  I can't wait to use it in so mnay ways!	2015-08-02

Yeah, the Youth Boost is working!  I'm 72 and now my hair doesn't look a day older than 69!!  Seriously, though, if you shampoo and style your hair every day this product is probably going to be just as good for you as other mousse hair styling products.  At first it is a little hard to know how much to use and that isn't helped by the fact that I get a different amount of mousse in my hand each time I press the dispenser.  I'm hoping that will even out as I use more of the product out of the can because I feel I am wasting a good bit -- I seriously don't need all the mousse that is being dispensed right now but it is so hard to control.<br /><br />I apply the mousse to towel dried hair and work it through before combing.  I like to allow my hair to dry naturally, but for the first time using this product I did use a hair dryer.  There was definitely more volume when my hair was dry and it actually was quite a bit softer.  I don't shampoo every day so now I just allow my hair to air dry each time.  I get exactly the same results with and without a hair dryer.  Unfortunately, the added volume seems to only stay in my hair for the first day.  The softness stays really well and the mousse isn't causing my hair to become oily between shampoos.  I do not notice any particular scent, but since I have just finished using a tea tree oil shampoo which has a wonderful minty smell, I might not notice anything from the Tresemme unless it was just overpowering.<br /><br />Overall I will definitely use the remainder of the product in this can and buy another to have it as a &#34;sometimes use&#34; alternative to the product I use most often.  The container is very stylish looking with the combination of the black and lavender colors so it looks nice sitting out on the vanity.  Really, this works as well as any regular hold strength mousse I've used before.  A nice addition to my product shelf.	2015-08-02

I especially like the eye shadow brushes they can pack the shadow on the lid quickly and evenly. They are a cute pop of color in my brush collection. They did smell funny for awhile after purchase, but once they had time to air out and the travel case was able air out it was fine. Almost all the brush heads did fall off, looking inside the head it looked like the gluing process was cheaply and quickly done. It was easily fixed with some super glue, so not a big issue for me personally. The reason I'm giving this set a 4 is because I have bought other sets of brushes off of amazon, that are softer and of a better quality. But these brushes are great support brushes for my favorite brushes	2015-08-02

I am very happy with this product! I have been having a problem with my hair breaking a lot lately. I recently lost a very good friend and the stress and shock from that has caused my hair to break and fall out. I have fine, thin hair to begin with. So I decided I better invest in some good products before I end up bald, lol (way too young to be bald).<br /><br />I was very skeptical of this particular product based on reviews of it being fake. So as soon as I got it, I took it (along with the shampoo) to my stylist. She verified that this is the actual product, as is the shampoo I bought ( Kerastase Resistance Bain Force Architecte Reconstructing Shampoo, 8.5 Ounce Sold by: Beauty Aid Essentials). She even used it when she washed my hair. She works at Regis now, and they don't carry this product, but other salons she has worked at do. But she said for my hair condition, these were the best products to use.<br /><br />After using this and the shampoo for a few days, my hair is super soft, shiny, and healthy looking! I have noticed much fewer strands of hair in the drain and the brush! I am very happy with these products. They have saved my hair! Thank you Kerastatse!!!	2015-08-02

I don't have to do that with my Edwin Jagger, vintage Gillettes, or my $15 Feather Popular.  The finish on the Edwin Jagger is also much nicer.  Don't get me wrong: i like the 34C.

These are a classy looking, brushed stainless steel, set of fingernail clippers. I appreciate that they are made of stainless steel, as in a humid bathroom metal that is not is prone to rusting. The brushed look is modern and sleek, though I don't often look for modern and sleek in my fingernail/toenail clippers, I will admit, it is a nice touch. What I do look for though is that these have a file in them, and I do like that. At first I had a difficult moment finding it, because it wasn't in the same place as many other files on fingernail clippers, it is not a separate slide out piece, rather it is a little file on the underside of the main lever. Its actually a better quality file than I am used to seeing on these clippers as well, which is nice. In a pinch I could use it for more than just the occasional hangnail.<br />This item is high quality and I was glad to have the chance to review it.<br />I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

Lavender is one of my favorite scents, although  it is often fleeting.  But, with Blossom and Pearl,  the fragrance lingers for a long time.  The balm is great for dry cuticles and elbows, or for a little fragrance on the skin.  I have started using the mist to simply spray the air while I do some deep breathing to reduce stress.  Works great, and I always end up in a better mood! We use the bath salts to soak our feet, and love how fragrant and soft the skin becomes. These are wonderful, high-quality products  come in a decorated box -  perfect for gifts without the added cost of gift wrap. I highly recommend them for any age, for any occasion.	2015-08-02

Unfortunately, on and off I've suffered from a dry scalp and whatever I used failed to assist or help the problem long term..  I did a bit of research on the web and found several positive reviews about Tropic Isle Castor Oil. I apply to my scalp the evening before I go to get my hair wash; I wrap it or tie it down with a scarf, go to asleep. The following day my beautician washes it out (I use Alter Ego Garlic Shampoo). It took 3 treatments (3 Saturdays) but I noted a major difference; my scalp was no longer flaky and was growing at faster rate.  Once a month I now use castor oil as a scalp treatment.  My only advise is to add it only to the scalp and not the actual hair.	2015-08-02

I have a capricious and sensitive skin that reacts to lot of chemicals that are routinely added to cosmetics. I live in the UK and this lotion is not widely available, but I thought I would give it a go. Got it from amazon.com, paid VAT and delivery costs and hoped it was worth it.<br /><br />It was worth it. Things I like:<br /><br />- It is natural. No nasty chemicals and upset my skin.<br />- It is not greasy. It absorbs very well and you only need a little. The bottle will last a while.<br />- You don't need to apply it very often. Once your dryness settles, you will probably need occasional applications.<br />- It makes my skin feel very silky and smooth.<br /><br />Things to watch: It has a very pleasant but initially noticeable smell, which comes from natural ingredients. I like it and like to smell it on my clothes, but if you are very smell sensitive or highly allergic, have a test first.<br /><br />And one more thing - the team that created the lotion was very helpful. A big thank you to them.	2015-08-02

Don't be confused by the name, it looks nothing like natural blonde hair- and again, that's what I had hoped for. Other reviews had left me skeptical that the wig would look like the picture, but if you're like me then let me put your fears to rest because yes, it IS that intense sunflower color with mac n' cheese orange mixed in, and it is lovely. As for quality and fullness, the front has plenty of hair between the bangs and regular bits but the back is a little thin. To be fair, the only time I noticed the wig cap was when I was moving around a lot or when I split it into handfuls for a potential braid, but it's something to keep in mind. If you're going to be wearing something on your head over it though you will be fine. And for my needs wearing it once or twice with a costume, especially since I struggled to find another wig in a similar color at a reasonable price, it's not a deal breaker for me. Just something to consider if you're looking for a wig for a long-term project over a costume that's a lark. And one more thing, the wig does come in standard size with little straps inside to make it smaller, but something I didn't see anyone mention is that the straps are not adjustable. You either fit the standard no-straps size, or you fit the tighter &#34;size&#34; with the straps. That's it. Not an issue for me, but something to think about if you're buying this for maybe a child or someone with a smaller head.	2015-08-02

Essential oils are a natural oil typically obtained by distillation and having the characteristic fragrance of the plant or other source from which it is extracted. Essential oils are generally extracted by distillation, often by using steam. Some of essential oils are Sweet orange, Peppermint, Lemon, Eucalyptus globulus, Clove leaf.

Felt like I am rubbing my face with diaper cream. So extremely sticky and greasy. It did not prevent sunburns. I decided to research on sunscreens and I learned that zinc oxide requires a dispersing agent (e.g. non-surface active polymer or a surface-active substance like polyhydroxystearic acid or PEG-#s) to prevent them to clump together or drop at the bottom of the bottle.

Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum by Azure Naturals is a fantastic product.  In my 40's I have had sensitive skin issues due to menopause.  I was excited to try this product and see if I could make my skin feel smoother and more hydrated.  After quick shipping and very nice packaging I was able to try my new product quickly.  This serum comes in a brown pump glass bottle.  I applied just a small amount to smooth onto my face.  I have applied it in the morning and evening and have had no skin sensitivity problems.  I really like this product and I really LOVE the smell.  The smell is snot to strong and does not linger.  My skin feel smoother.  Other members in my family have tried the serum and they like it as well.  The 1 fl oz bottle will last me quite some time so it is very good on the budget!  Please note that I was given this product as a free trial to use and to give my unbiased and honest opinion.	2015-08-02

I've been using Smart Mouth since 2007 and nothing works better for my breath. As long as I have income, I'd have this as a priority on my list of consumables.

This razor is not bulky for my hands. The holder for this has great suction cups, i hear them *snap* into place when pushed firmly to the shower wall. It has yet to fall after 2 nights :-) I didn't get to choose the color, it's random.. it's Green.<br />I would DEF. recommend this product, but the razor refills are overpriced in my local stores.

Beautiful well made wig. I purchased this wig for my sister and she loves it. She said it fits very well and it looks very natural for a white wig. It's every long as shown in the photos.

I realize they are low priced, but they are about the same price as other ones that I have purchased and are not even close to the same quality.  In fact, it takes SO long to get these that I ended up buying other ones and getting them way before these finally showed up.  However, I was expecting the long wait and figured I would be able to give these to some people as gifts.  No... I won't be doing that.<br /><br />Here are the problems that I have with these:  the plastic bags on these are stuck under the top pieces and will take a lot of work to get them out, they do not line up very well when being closed, all 4 of the ones that I bought have little scratches on the mirrors and fingerprints all over them, they are dirty (which might have come from the fact that they were not sealed very well in the shipping bag and that came open on the long trip), you DO NOT get a very good variety, and the &#34;gems&#34; do not look very nice and are not inserted straight.  I purchased 4 and only got red ones which was rather disappointing but not too surprising.  Two of the designs were the same which makes sense when they only show a total of 3 designs.  However, I didn't even get 1 of the designs that are shown and instead got a design that wasn't even in the picture.<br /><br />Another thing to mention is that the colors of the stones for the ones in the pictures are not the same as the ones that I got.  That's not that big of a deal to me, but if you are looking at these for the specific stone colors... don't expect them to be the same.<br /><br />Overall, if the stones had been lined up in their spots and the mirrors not scratched, I probably could have dealt with the rest of the problems OK.  I don't mind having to clean them although these are very difficult to clean since the top piece is raised so high from the red under it.  The smell of the metal is very strong as well so hopefully cleaning it will get rid of that or dull it down.  These did not come with any covers or bags, either, like others that I have purchased so if you are going to be putting it into a purse be prepared for the stones to come out and/or scratches on the outside.  Personally, I'll be passing on these in the future for other ones that I have bought.	2015-08-02

Dead Sea Mud mask has a nice subtle scent. It does't have that chemical scent like most products do. The sea mud comes packaged in a nice plastic like jar. It's dark grey in color and is pretty thick.You don't have to apply a lot to cover your face. I applied the sea mud on my face and left it on for 15 minutes. By the way, you may want to warn people around you that you have this on so you don't scare them.. lol... While drying I felt a cooling sensation on my face which I found was pleasant. After 15 minutes passed, I used a facial buff with warm water and used circular patterns to clean the sea mud off and patted my face dry with a towel. The skin on my face felt clean, tighter, and had a nice glow to it. Overall I really like the sea mud. Next time I'm going to use it on my husbands face and see how he likes it.<br />**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes.

I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I'm 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It's generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and now the mask. Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin. I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis. This mask is the first mask I have ever been able to use that doesn't cause my skin to erupt the day after use and doesn't irritate or dry out my skin at all. I love the way my skin feels after I've used it. I've never felt better about my own face and it's because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results. There's something about this line that just works for me and I'm so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it's a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it's completely worth it.	2015-08-02

The scent is a light mint, which is very pleasant but not overwhelming. It is refreshing and lasts just long enough. I use this primarily as a body lotion after showering, but prefer the matching hand cream for my hands since it is thicker and more moisturizing -- which my dry hands really need, although if your hands are not too dry, this would also be good for routine hand moisturizing.   This hand & body lotion pairs nicely with the matching Shower Gel and also the Sugar & Salt Scrub (although I had both, I prefer the latter). This lotion would not work as well for extremely dry skin, like in the winter -- the body butter is better suited for that. Overall, an effective moistuzing lotion, at a good price, especially with the subscribe & save discount.	2015-08-02

It is the perfect size and the mirror part of it flips, so you can access the magnnified side. The only reason I have given it a 4-star rating is becaue the magnified side is slightly distorted.

[[VIDEOID:d16f03ab949a35f0aa937c2aa85713f3]] Sadly, I still suffer from breakouts once or twice a month that drive me insane even though I follow a twice-daily skin care routine. This oil control face mask from Retseliney has been a gentle and effective way to keep my acne and blackheads under control!<br /><br />I've tried mud masks and clay masks in the past, which always dry and make me feel like a living statue. This mask is thick, somewhat sticky and dries flexible! It's great to not have to worry about smiling with my face mask on and cracking it, or feeling like I can't make any expression without dealing with flakes of mask. I found that a thin layer worked best for me and it's very easy to get an even layer of product on my skin.<br /><br />My face is very pale and can be very sensitive, especially to harsh products. This face mask is packed full of natural ingredients that treat my skin so well! The included juniper, cayenne and lavender are all organic and well-known for taking great care of skin. This mask also has green tea and aloe vera which make it wonderful for soothing irritated areas.<br /><br />I've been very impressed with this mask from Retseliney, and I'm excited to add it - along with its cleanser and moisturizer counterparts from the same company - to my daily routines! I was provided with a sample of this mask but price doesn't change how great my skin feels after using it, nor does it effect my review.	2015-08-02

In my opinion, there is no better eyebrow product out there (and I have tried plenty!).  Great value, lasts all day, and is very easy to adjust the color to your liking just by applying with less or more pressure which leaves less or more product on your brows.

I bought this product -(3 Pack) SALLY HANSEN 18 Hour Moisturizing Hand Creme.

But the product I received was not what I paid for, this is some different creme, different packaging (not what is on picture), that smells awfully (with gasoline) and I was even scared to try it!

I ordered this to help with my son's eczema and we've tried SO MANY products and dermatologist creams over the years. I'm tired of strong prescription strength creams that work a little but never make the eczema go away (and are expensive too!).  I'm finding that this pure organic Argan Oil soothes his skin just as well and I feel better about the natural ingredients.<br /><br />I like that the bottle had a plastic seal on it, and then it had a paper strip further securing it.  The pump screwed on easily and makes it so much easier to use.  My son can use it too, since he just turned 10 and I want him to start taking more care with his eczema care and preventing flare ups.  I don't worry he will tip the bottle over and spill it all with an easy to use pump.<br /><br />I am also using this for me as well, especially at night on my dry feet and it's making a big difference.  I have problem acne areas from time to time on my chin too, and smoothing some on my chin since I read that it helps with acne.  I have noticed that my cuticles are so soft now and my hands feel wonderful.  I love that there is not a strong scent with this oil.  My son HATES anything that has an odor of perfumes or smells &#34;funny&#34; and we can both use this product for many uses.  I will continue to slather this oil in him 2-3 times a day over areas he has eczema.  I see that the skin is not as red and it's so very helpful not to let his skin dry out.  He scratches terribly at night when his skin gets dry, so this is a big part of our bedtime routine to calm his itching problems.  Eczema is such a terrible ailment for so many children!  I love trying new skin products so I was thrilled to receive this Argon Oil for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  It's a quality product, and pure, Organic oil.  I feel so good about buying the real deal oil, and not worry about harsh ingredients for me or my child.	2015-08-02

I was able to try this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I honestly didn't have high hopes that the color would match my skin tone however, I was pleasantly surprised that this color did match. I normally use full coverage foundations ( becca, Mac, or nars) and I apply with a damp beauty blinder and set with Mac fix+ . I tried a damp beauty blinder to apply the Guerlain tined day cream and that didn't work for me because of the fairness of my skin tone but I used a buffing makeup brush and with that it made my skin flawless with out the heavy feeling of full coverage formula. This tinted day cream had a luxurious feel and performed way beyond my expectations.  I Would defiantly repurchase this product.	2015-08-02

Beauty	5	18	19	N	Y	Mystere 3D Fiber Lash Mascara a Winner	This product really does what it says it will do if applied as instructed.  I found using a very light hand to apply both the gel color and the fibers is the best way so it does not clump up.  I have worn artificial eyelashes until recent years and due to the hassle of such I gave up on having full-looking lashes until I read about this product and decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did.  I don't wear makeup everyday now that I am retired but when I do leave the house I will definitely use this to enhance the lashes I have.  It is quick and easy to remove with your usual facial cleanser.  Just follow the instructions as this is paramount to the application and incidentally, no eye irritation for me at all.  Try it, I think you will like having full-looking lashes if you are not blessed with them already.	2015-08-02

This stuff has caused miracles to happen!! I am a type 1 diabetic who has had some sort of acne all of my life i have NEVER been able to find something powerful enough to keep my face hydrated UNTIL NOW!! I have used EVERYTHING on the market + been to a dermatologist all of my life, and when i say I have used EVERYTHING i mean EVERYTHING. All i had to do was find something that was mostly natural and/or organic, I can't believe i NEVER thought of that!!! I have never in my life been able to have a clear, hydrated, and healthy looking face until now, and when i started this 2 weeks ago my face was completely dry and flaky and i had several hormone related acne spots, after ordering DHEA 50mg along with the Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum + the Vitamin C serum by Joy and Karma. My face finally looks BEAUTIFUL, and what's funny is the dryness went away after my first use. I will swear by this stuff until the day i die!! Joy and Karma has now changed my life to the fullest and I'm so excited to be able to go show my new face off!!	2015-08-02

I have been using the Beauty Blender for a few years now and I cannot do my makeup without it! I know most use it for foundation however I found it most useful for me to buff out my concealer with. It gives my under eye coverage and highlight a flawless well blended coverage and though I apply my foundation with a brush, I go over it with the BeautyBlender for an all over buffed out effect. My order lasted me 3 years and I just recently has to repurchase because it was getting old and tattered up. I was a little disappointed to see my new one ripped a bit so quickly near the tip after only a few months however it still works fine and this comes in two which is perfect. The cleanser is great as well and really gets the make up out of the blender. Definitely a must have in any makeup kit, professional or not.	2015-08-02

Usually I give up before I really see rests because my gums become very sensitive. I had the opportunity to test the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System free through Crest and BzzAgent. The kit is a two step process, the first step being a toothpaste and the second step being the whitener that you use on your toothbrush. You use it twice daily as your brushing regimen. I found that very convenient. After a week of use as suggested, my gums did indeed become sensitive. I scaled back to using the step two only once a day. After three weeks of use I have noticed my teeth appear slightly whiter and brighter.	2015-08-02

Ok- I saw a headline on yahoo regarding how this sunscreen isn't great so I decided to post my review. I along with many bough this at Costco at half the price on amazon. My husband is Irish and fair skinned!! He burns walking in front of a window! So- I read the complaints this morning sent him a text on how he likes it and he said works good just greasy which sucks when you looked like you oiled up before you golf- but he said it's fine for the pool. We we at a water park for 4 hours in the Midwest when it was 97 degrees and the water even felt like a hot tub. My husband, 3 year old, and I lathered it on and never reapplied because we were too lazy and all that my husband got was a slight burn on the back of his shoulders. He's had way worse and we never reapplied. I see a lot of the photos of the sunburns and they are shoulder and back and I feel it comes down to lack of reapplication and not putting enough on. We used almost a whole tube of this just the 3 of us when we went and we are all slim people. You have to &#34;liberally&#34; apply and evenly. You should look like a greasy monster then your done. The greasy look goes away. Some people might not like that but it's an all natural sunscreen. I bought it because I checked out EWG skin deep website on sunscreen and SOOO many have high risk chemicals in them- so this might not be the most appealing but it works and unless your setting a timer on your watch and am having someone put it on your shoulders and back every 80min you really shouldnt diss this so bad. You can't put sunscreen on your back by yourself!! I like this stuff. I take my son to our local zoo several times a month and we lather in this and never get a burn. I have to put bronzer on my face just to look like I have color on it. You have be liberal about applying I mean a big glob just for your arm. I thinks it's one of the more affordable products on the market . I will continue to buy it.	2015-08-02

(...and I have used A LOT!!) It is so easy to maintain a solid grip on this one!! There are two sides - a metal side for filing to remove any calluses and a smooth side to ensure no rough edges or dry skin remains behind. I have noticed that I do not need a pumice stone or any kind foot scrubs which can be very time consuming and expensive. With spending only about five minutes on each foot, I was able to EASILY remove the calluses around my toes and the heel of my foot. Other foot files I have used always left behind a few places that I just could not smooth out. The dry skin that I could not file off would snag on my shoes or my sheets when I was in bed. I could not find a Foot File and Callus Remover that WOULD reach all the little nooks and crannies in my feet until now!! By the time I am done filing my feet, they feel as smooth as they do after a professional pedicure!! This ones measures roughly 5 inches for the handle giving you PLENTY of room for a nice, firm grasp and about 4 inches of file area so you CAN maneuver in even the toughest of spots on your feet!! It comes in 5 different colors (blue, bronze, bright pink, pink, and purple) however your color will be sent randomly. I received the bronze and it does not look bad at all. Yes, I am one VERY HAPPY person now...with silky, soft feet!! :-) (I was provided a sample of this product through a promotion in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

I have darkish red hair and my brows are more orange. This dye was a gradual change (it goes on white and darkens) but I kept it on until it was as dark as it was getting and am happy with the result. It seems like it can range from light to medium brown depending on how long you leave it. It doesn't have an orange tint as the packaging might imply. This stuff does not stain your skin. I was actually trying to stain mine to cover a small scar in my eyebrow. It washes off easily, which I realize is generally a good thing. The dye seems to last a long time. It has been a week and I haven't noticed any fading. Considering how long it seems to last and how little is needed to cover brows, this product is a really good deal compared to salon prices. Don't try to use it on your lashes unless you have help, your eyes need to remain closed or it will sting like you rubbed a chilli in your eyes.	2015-08-02

I admit that it is my own fault, I didn't read the description closely enough, but I am still very disappointed this model does NOT have the 30 second, quadrant timer feature. What really gets my goat is that Philips could have provided this important health feature with zero added expense, but deliberately chose not to. There is already a timer for 2 minute shut-off, this is a beeper/buzzer mechanism, I am 100% sure that all the  electronics are inside to provide the quadrant timer, and Philips went out of their way to disable it via their internal software, all so they could up-sell to a more profitable model. Yes, they are in business not to please customers but to make money, I understand this. Fine. But this is clearly a company that does not care about their customer's health, just the bottom line. In 18 months, after I've used up my supply of replacement heads, I'll be buying one of their competitor's models and will never buy another Philips product. I chose to buy from good companies, not sleazy ones.	2015-08-02

Although the item that I received matched the listing description and would have been perfect for packing two months  worth of clothes for a toddler, unfortunately the item that we received was damaged. I didn't even get a chance to open the other bags included in the set because there was a large cut on the largest bag that was about 4 inches that rendered the product useless. It is a shame that we will not be able to use these packing cubes.  The size and color are great and it would have made packing for our trip so much easier and organized. Although the product is well worth the affordable price tag, I am unable to rate the actual set that I received any higher as I am not able to use it due to its condition upon receipt.	2015-08-02

Bought this last week from the seller &#34;Pharmapacks&#34;. I've been using the real Biosilk product for a while now and decided to buy it on amazon for cheaper. Shipping was fast. When it arrived, I examined both my previous authentic bottle and this new bottle and realized many differences. There were a lot more ingredients in fake product. Which caused a more alcoholic smell and made it more liquidy and more bubbly. It also contains both kinds of SLS which actually dries out hair. There were also many differences from the texts written on the bottles. The fake bottle does not have any register trademark symbols, which an authentic bottle should have after &#34;Biosilk&#34; and &#34;Silk Therapy&#34;. I do NOT recommend buying this from Amazon. I recommend buying at a real salon even if it means paying more. It's worth the money. The original product is great!	2015-08-02

Diminish Fine Lines And Wrinkles. For Smoother, Younger-Looking Skin.	Beauty	5	6	6	N	N	Helps ensure brighter, more radiant skin	This is a wonderful serum that helps create a healthy glow.  I used this product together with Elique Naturals Collagen-pm Night Creme over the course of a couple of weeks, and enjoyed the way these two products work together. There is a kind of natural synergy between this anti-wrinkle serum and the hydroxy acid with vitamin E that really works well.<br /><br />I am in my 50's and I have sensitive skin, so I appreciate the all-natural ingredients that Elrique Naturals so consistently utilizes in all of their products I've tried so far. I realized that this serum works best when used together with some kind of moisturizer, and I recommend doing just that, rather than risking experiencing a drying effect which could occur if this product is used only by itself.<br /><br />Wrinkles definitely seem reduced, and my face looks brighter and feels wonderfully recharged after each night's prior application.<br />I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-02

I used to be that person who could walk out the house, forget to put on deodorant, and be okay all day. For whatever reason, my body chemistry changed and I couldn't even go 10 minutes after a fresh shower without deodorant! Absolutely nothing worked for me in this Texas heat! I tried every extra strength, clinical protection, crystal deodorant on the market. Then I searched Amazon and found Green Tidings. I was a little thrown off by the price but I was willing to pay anything to combat the shame and embarrassment of walking around with my pits clinged closed, afraid to give anyone a hug or wave hello. I tried the 1oz sample lavender first. I loved it for its protection but the scent was too strong for my liking. Ecstatic over my results, I took the plunge and ordered the 3-pack unscented! This deodorant is absolutely amazing!!! I can go all day in 105 degree temps without reapplying and most importantly without having to do the sniff test throughout the day! I will gladly pay the price to walk around confidant in knowing that no one who passes me with get a whiff of onion-scented pits!<br />-Don's Wife	2015-08-02

I have had great results in versa spa at Sun Tan City salon using this! I haven't had streaks at all. I think the price is excellent and it last a super long time. For me a bottle of this lasts all Spring and Summer. This is also an excellent price as this sells for 2x the price in the salon!

There is no need to change clippers anymore, just adjust the dial to the length you wish to trim your hair or beard and let the trimmer do the rest for you.<br /><br />If you are into manly products and like keeping your hair or beard in neat condition, then this product is a must!	2015-08-02

Only two days took7 for this product to shows results on my eyelashes!!

It didn't caused me any irritation or any discoloration on my eyelids, and I have very sensitive skin. I was reluctant to buy this product because I read some reviews of people who had developed redness on the eyelids, but it didn't happened to me. I also used on my eyebrows, because I over plucked one of my eyebrows so much that I have a bald spot on one, and last night, after 7-8 days of being using this product twice a day I'm seeing hair growing on the bald spot!

I have never had back acne until I started using the shampoo and conditioner. I thought it was due to stress, at that time I had started a new job and I was busy planning for my wedding. After 4 months I finally figured it out and decided to look up reviews on this product, I found a few that said this caused them to break out. I was out raged it caused me to break out and took me this long to figure it out. Once I stopped using these products, my back started to clear up and my face is back to normal. Now I am dealing with a few scars on my back and I have my wedding coming up soon. It is safe to say that I am very disappointed.	2015-08-02

The product kept my family from burns unlike many of these other reviewers, but we had to apply frequently. I greatly dislike the texture and consistency. It's thick, greasy and takes a lot of rubbing effort to not remain white once applied. I also did not like the smell of the lotion at all. For those reasons, I will not be purchasing this again. I can buy Alba or Kiss My Face for a similar price and natural quality and I like them a lot better.	2015-08-02

I don't know if it's just another lovely part of getting older, but according to my doctor, to find out what they are I have to go to a dermatologist and have one scraped. I was like, uh no.<br /><br />So, I have been making up my own soap, nothing fancy like some people can do, I just buy a big cheap bottle of baby body wash (from the dollar store) and transfer some to a 6oz bottle with several drops of tea tree oil and that has helped me, so far.<br /><br />I'm a beginner when it comes to essential oils, but this tea tree oils seems to be your standard strength, and a good quality.

I have only used this cream for about a week now, but I have already noticed a difference. I have tried SO MANY creams since developing rosacea a few years ago. This is the only one that I have had positive results with. Not even the sulfatecetamide prescribed by my doctor worked. As a bonus, this cream is not greasy and there is almost no scent at all. It smells a little like cream (which I like). I'm leaving the country for a while, so I immediately ordered another 4oz jar of this lovely face cream.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this cream for 5 mos now and my rosacea has really improved. I have an occasional flare up around my monthly cycle, but a zinc supplement keeps that in check for the most part. Just ordered another jar. I'm hooked.	2015-08-02

If you don't like wearing heavy, sticky lip products like lip glosses, I strongly recommend purchasing this product it's amazing. One thing that I wasn't satisfied was the color. I purchased mandarine juice but I didn't like its yellowish orange color so I use it with other lip products. But overall it was a good purchase.	2015-08-02

My grandmother used to use an English lavender soap, so the scent has emotional feelings of comfort, peace and well-being. Coincidentally or not, the same can be said of the aromatic potential of lavender oil itself. I especially like to diffuse this with either chamomile or vanilla for a really complete, comfortable and homey scent. This oil is really potent. I don't need nearly as much as I did of the one I bought at an in-person store last month. This bottle is also larger and was cheaper than the 1oz. bottle I got at the market. Be careful if you're using this in a diffuser. A little REALLY goes a long way. I would suggest using a little less than you think you should just to make sure you don't overpower the room<br /><br />They also emailed me a guide for other uses for the oil that I found really helpful to add to my repertoire of home remedies and natural products iI can make at home.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY FAIR, HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

These things do exactly what they are supposed to do - keep the toilet seat from sliding from side to side.  Only one caveat - we have one toilet which has a plastic seat with a concave underside to the seat, and I don't think the bumpers can be mounted on it.  I believe the seat underside has to be flat in order to mount these bumpers correctly.	2015-08-02

As a former makeup consultant, clients often complain of oily or dry skin.  This bar doesn't leave your skin feeling tight and dry.  It's very creamy when lathered and is practically fragrance free - which are a big plus to avoid possible further skin irritation.  I use this bar to cleanse my face whether I have makeup on or not - no cold cream needed!  The lathered bar gently washes and cleanses the skin and removes the toughest of makeups.  Sometimes, I use this as a body bar, too because it's that GOOD!	2015-08-02

I didn't have any sensitivity to the product.  As with teeth whitening systems that use peroxide this one is gentler on the gums and cheeks.  It did take a couple days for my teeth to start showing any difference but it does.  I drink a lot of Coke Zero with caffeine in it and I love fruit.  So the stain on my teeth was hard to remove.<br /><br />  This product was easy to use.  You boil some water in the microwave and place the mouth piece in the cup about 10 seconds.  After that time the tray feels soft enough to place on your teeth to mold to your teeth.  You take them out of your mouth and trim off the tab and rinse.  You place a small amount of the whitening gel from the syringe in the trays on the side of your teeth that show when you smile.  Do this on both trays.  Place them in your mouth and insert the light resting them against your trays for 15 minutes twice a day.  Remove them and rinse them.<br /><br />  You will like this product.  It works well.  This product arrived quickly and was packaged safely.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System.  As always, my words and my opinions are 100% my very own.	2015-08-02

I've applied it to my abdomen, hips, and thighs. My skin in that area felt firmer after a few hours and my skin has smoothed out substantially. My only complaint is that the directions appear to be rather vague. It doesn't tell you an approximate amount to use per area, how often to use it, and whether it should be applied before a moisturizer. This could help standardize the results people receive and prevent customers from using too much or too little of the product and not having the desired results. Or maybe I'm just too nit-picky. Although I did receive this item for a review, if things keep improving I'll purchase a few tubes for maintenance and to give to a few friends. I'll update this review in a month or so if the results appear to be long lasting.	2015-08-02

It's like boom, instant at-home spa! This one is made from the healing mud of the dead sea, which has a higher concentration of salts and minerals to promote healing and all sorts of skin benefits. What I love about it is how fabulous my skin looks and feels after using it. My pores are visibly smaller and my skin is softer to the touch and feels tightened and tingly. It really only takes a little, even if you coat it on thickly. Just be sure to rinse thoroughly, the mud likes to hide in the small creases in your face such as beside your nose. This would be a sweet gift for any lady - or guy!-  in your life, from teen to grandma, who wants gorgeous skin.<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.	2015-08-02

I've never had a wig be as small with the wig cap as this one. With that being said, it fits rather 'ok' not great. I have to say with extended wear it doesn't itch like some do and it brushes out very easily! It is not super long and the bangs are about the normal length of real natural bangs. So there isn't a need for cutting or trimming. It would look 100% natural (if you ask me) if it wasn't the color it is. I got the red and it's like CHERRY red. Very bright and shiny. I love the feel of the hair and I love that the wig cap isn't irritating so I am some what pleased with the item. It was shipped fast and I'm planning on using it but with the color and shine it can't be a day-to-day use. Unfortunately.	2015-08-02

I really like the design and that you don't have to heat the wax in a warmer or microwave. You aren't going to burn yourself with these strips as they don't require heating, only rubbing the strips in your hands to warm them. No actual heat source required. This pack comes with 24 strips, 12 (2 strips stuck together) and 2 wax cleansing cloths. Its best to let your hair grow a little to achieve the best results. They recommend the hair length to be at least 1/4 of an inch. These strips have a mild smell to them, but the smell does go away fairly quickly. The strips themselves work pretty well. I followed the directions and warmed the strips between my hands and then pulled them apart. I place both strips on my leg and rubbed several times in the direction of the hair growth. When it was time to pull the strips off, I was a little scared. I held the skin taut an and then ripped the strip off quickly. I'm not gonna lie, I screamed! It hurt but the pain went away fairly quickly. When I looked at the wax strip it had quite a bit of hair on it, My leg also looked pretty good. It did leave some hairs behind but not many. I continued to scream after each and every strip I ripped off and when I finished, my legs felt good. There were a couple spots I felt I needed to follow up with a razor to get remaining hairs but it really wasn't a lot. So far its been 3 days since I waxed using these strips and my legs still feel pretty good. I'm not sure if the hair will be gone for 8 weeks, or even a week for that matter but the longer the hair stays away the more likely I will be to purchase again. Overall so far so good. I purchase this product during a promotion at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

I have to optimize all the variables in my shave to get a comfortable BBS shave. Even so I get irritation issues too often. My skin tells me how I have done very clearly each and every shave.  At first I got several poor shaves with this. I gave it a 1 star review and now am revising it out of fairness due to the latest results. The trick was to maximize the slickness with a uniform addition of water, using a small brush (my fingers did not do a good and uniform job of mixing water into the face bound cream).  Now, I get good shaves this way, although not quite up to the level I get with the majority of tallow based soap/cream products available. It seems to be in the range with the good quality vegan (tallow/animal free) products out there. Not bad at all; but, not &#34;Astonishingly&#34; great either. It is weird, shaving with such a low visibility and thin product. There is no so called foam cushion effect with this.  An extra star off (3 to 2) for the over hyped advertisement. This product should work real well for most shavers as long as the hydrating issue is well done and they adapt to the lack of foam..	2015-08-02

I swabbed it on the leaves of a lemon tree infested with mealy bugs. My tree is &#34;feeling&#34; a lot better and I am not seeing the bugs anymore. I am hoping that the problem has been dealt with sufficiently, but if the bugs return I know now how to thwart them. After reading more about Neem oil I found that it has a multiplicity of uses related to human health. It is being used for cancerous tumors in India and is purported to work to stop skin cancer growths too so there could be a lot more to Neem oil than use as  just a bug killer.	2015-08-02

The only other issue is that the trimmer is difficult to open. Other than these two issues, the razor holds a charge for up to two weeks, is easy to use, and does not irritate my skin.

I am in my 60s and my hair has become thinner but this product works so well to add fullness and body!<br /><br />  I mainly spray it on the top/back part of my head, wait for it to dry (dries very quickly!), comb it through, style as usual and you cannot see any scalp showing though!  I sometimes use it all over my head if I want a particularly full and long-lasting hair style!<br /><br /> It is invisible and has no lasting odor. I use it every other day and you cannot tell that I've skipped a shampoo!  Great product for anyone at any age who has fine, limp, and/or thinning hair to add more body and the impression of thickness!  Works very well for &#34;bed-head&#34;, also.<br /><br /> I love this product and recommend it highly!	2015-08-02

I have light skin and I use one coat if spray just to get rid of the stark white skin.  The trick is to rub in a light oil (I use Avon skin so soft spray) before spraying on legs.  This will smooth away the rough edges and will make the spray go on even.  Don't overdo.	2015-08-02

While that may not be enough time to see great results, I can say that the product goes on feeling very silky--a feeling that is still there the next morning. For a very dry face like mine, waking up soft and silky is very preferable to waking up tight and dry. I think I will like this product even more the longer I use it. Also, the little pods the product comes in are cute, easy to use, and ensure you are using the correct amount of product. They would also be handy when traveling because they would cut down on the number of bottles I would have to pack.<br /><br />The reason I gave this product 4 stars rather than 5 is not really a reflection on the product itself but on the seller. I looked it up online to be sure, but as soon as I squirted the first bit of product out of the little pod, I had a feeling I hadn't received a fresh product. While the picture of the product I found showed the serum to be a light beige-ish color, the product I received squirted out as a dijon mustard sort or color. It even had some swirls of brown as I squirted out the last of the pod. I was actually afraid to use the product at first, but since I received the product in exchange for an honest review, I took the chance and used it. Luckily, I've had no adverse affects from using the product as of yet. I do realize that some skin care products have longer shelf-lives than consumers realize, but discoloration is not a good sign and I was disappointed that I received the product in that condition. Had I paid the full price for the product, I would have been very upset and asked for a refund.<br /><br />Elizabeth Arden is a name I trust my skin to, but I'm not sure I feel as trusting of this seller. The likelihood of me ordering from this seller again is not very high, unless it is a product that doesn't expire.	2015-08-02

I purchased this cream hoping that it would be a good addition to my nightly routine, but it has been just the opposite. Many reviews online said it was great, however those must have been about the older formula. I have acne prone skin and two days after starting to use this I have one of the worst breakouts I have ever had, I never get acne on my forehead but I have about 30 spots right now, and they are so painful. If you have acne prone skin do not use this product!!!! I'm not sure if its the fragrance, but this has ruined my skin just as I was getting it back to normal. Initially I loved it, it was smooth and silky and really made my skin feel amazing after using my normal acne routine,  but ultimately I will be throwing this away. Its frustrating to not be able to use adult skincare products on adult skin, now I'll have to wait 2 weeks for my face to clear up. I think the only people safe to use this product are people who have never had a zit in their entire life, and even then I'd be weary to recommend it.	2015-08-02

I did not purchase on Amazon because I did not want to wait for delivery. My face has seemed uneven in tone lately, blotchy, and was breaking out. The skin was getting dry and I had picked at it and caused scabs. I do not get severe acne but from time to time my face will get pimples and clogged pours. I read all of the wonderful reviews so I figured I didn't have much to lose.<br /><br />I used organic apple cider vinegar with it and left it on my face for 20 minutes. It was a bit tricky to get off because you don't want to clog your drains with the mask. With warm water and paper towels it did come off in time.<br /><br />After I removed the mask I took a shower to wash any left over mask off. My skin was red after removing the mask but this disappeared after several minutes.<br /><br />After my shower I noticed an immediate difference in my skin. The blotchiness disappeared. My skin felt tighter and more clean and the pores appeared less visible. The scab I had on my face became so small as the mask removed all of the dead dry skin around it. I truly saw a difference after one application. I cannot wait to use this again! Definitely recommend.	2015-08-02

What can I say?  It is a dead skin slougher!  Looks like a cheese grater, very simple to use, and can make your feet sore if you do too much at one time.  It has a large surface area with a long sturdy handle so it is not too difficult to reach your feet if you aren't very flexible. You get two in the package in case you need one in every bathroom, don't want to share with your spouse or think you may lose it and can't wait to buy another.  In all seriousness, it does a great job keeping the dry skin at bay between pedicures.  The instructions recommend using it on dry feet, although I personally have found that it is more effective right when I first get out of the shower.  I also tend to be too vigorous when I use it dry so try it both ways to see what works best for you.	2015-08-02

My roommate and I both have slightly different Venus razors and these razor cartridges fit both of them perfectly.<br /><br />The built in moisture ribbon isn't a substitute for shaving cream so you still need some type lubricant in my opinion, but it definitely contributes to a smoother shave. However, I think the key to these cartridges is the 5 blades. MY LEGS FEEL LIKE DOLPHINS AND MY ARM PITS HAVE NO INGROWN HAIRS!!! Sold. Once you start using 5 blades it's so hard to go back. I used a Gillette 3-blade razor when I was traveling last week and I wanted to shoot myself. Okay not really but I did finish my shower in a bad mood. It took forever compared to these ones! Seriously, upgrade and you'll thank yourself and each one of the 5 blades.<br /><br />Also this pack is a great price for how long these last. Even though they are a little more than Gillette's 3- and 4-blade razor cartridges, they last noticeably longer. By the way, I don't really do this anymore because these blades last awhile, but if you're on a tight budget and really need your blades to last, you can keep a small cup of mineral/baby oil in your shower and soak your razor in it in between shaves. It keeps the blades sharp (mostly by staving off rust), but the only downside is it can start to dissolve the moisture strip.<br /><br />Anyway, very happy with these! I'll definitely purchase again.	2015-08-02

This smells like actual lavender flowers, which I love, and not some artificial lavender scent.  It cleans effectively without that stripped feeling, and I have very hard water so there's no residue after rinsing off.  I use this to wash delicates and it works well for that.  Lavender is an antimicrobial, so I'm sure that's what helps get the BO out of a sweaty bra or a silk shirt.  Considering I use this for many things, it's lasting a long time, so it's worth buying even when it's not on sale (sometimes WFs has this brand on sale for $8).  It leaked a little bit in shipping, but was thankfully wrapped up in plastic, so it did not destroy the books that were shipped with it.  But that's something to be aware of when purchasing.  You might not be as lucky as I was.	2015-08-02

First, they all feel cushiony to the touch - it's hard to explain except to say that it was very soft and had a nearly imperceptible give to it when swatched with finger tips. I've been using these products since I received them and have been very pleased with the way they look.<br /><br />Tone-wise they are all a bit similar, but behave differently. The highlighter is so subtle it's nearly invisible on, but gives just a nice hint of light to the top of the cheekbone. I used the blush on the apples of my cheeks  - I have to say, though subtle, it has buildable color, but is very pink, so I used it just enough to give a lightly healthy glow. The bronzer is a little more intense color-wise. It's very easy to apply too much because it is a soft product. My hard panned powder bronzers are a little easier to control;. With practice, though, I've found all three products work very well together.	2015-08-02

I just used this product for the first time on my day 3 hair and I'm pretty impressed. I was worried about the negative reviews this product had but i feel those people are either trying to use to much of it at once or are generally misusing this product. I have thick, long, S'wavy hair which i only like to wash once a week because I have dyed red hair. I get major frizz problems and shapelessness because my hair gets so dry after about 4 days of wearing it down. I just tried this and I noticed the moisture lock pretty fast! my frizz has reduced significantly and some shape bounced back and though the smell of this product out of the bottle is a bit to strong, once you put it in your hair (if you use it appropriately) the smell isn't nearly as bad.. i actually like it! I used about 6 spritz of it on my hand and gently worked it through my dry areas. The product IS a little sticky and I noticed people complaining about that but if your hair is dry and actually needs this product, you wont feel it on your hair. It will feel hydrated, bouncy and happy!	2015-08-02

I used to buy expensive eye primer. but not anymore because this stuff is amazing.  It is a bit &#34;tackier&#34; than Urban Decay and NARS brand eye primer, so blending on it bare is more difficult.  Still, for the price, it is pretty amazing.  It dries more clear than UD's primer and works in pretty well. My only advice (considering how much more tacky this primer is than UD) is to apply a neutral shadow to help blending.  Despite oily lids, my eyeshadow lasts over 8 hours.	2015-08-02

Additionally, it doesn't leave your lips feeling sticky and gross.This feature eliminates the issue of your lips being stuck together; as this occurs frequently with other glosses I've tried. Reapplication isn't necessary with this gloss, because it remains in tact for quite a while. The only time in which you would have to reapply would be after having a meal, but that goes for pretty much any type of lip wear in general. While the product is relatively lighter than the image above, it was still pretty close to it.	2015-08-02

While I haven't purchased the sunscreen in the new design of packaging (maybe a new formulation?) we have used their sunscreen (the blue tube, blue bottle spray and white stick) for years on our children with no complaints. Does it stay white on your skin? Yes! I would rather my kid look like a ghost than be slathered in chemicals. Is it greasy? Yes, not terribly but yes. Again, a trade off to loose the chemical laden products that I used to use. The spray we use by honest company is not greasy (but it's even whiter). But I can say with certaintity that my children have never been sunburned while using this product. I hope there wasn't a re formulation of the product that's causing all these bad reviews!

Like someone let a bottle of Windex ferment on a hot beach for a few weeks	Short answer: It smells awful. Do not buy it.<br /><br />Long answer: Colognes are personal. They interact with your personal body chemistry and will smell differently for different people and at different times. Where you spray it (side of neck, chest, on clothes, on skin), how much you put on (one spray or 3), when you put it on (after a shower in the morning, after working out, before going out at night). All of these factors will influence how it smells. Not to mention the chance you receive a knock off as opposed to the real product.<br /><br />So, that being said, Nautica Voyage for men did not smell good on me. It did not smell ok on me. It smelled awful. Like someone let a bottle of Windex ferment on a hot beach for a few weeks. Maybe it was me. Maybe it was one of those scents that do not work well with me. Maybe. All I know is that it was unusable. I tried. Really I did. I used it at different times, on different parts of my body and with varying amounts. Nothing helped. It still smelled like gasoline with chemical &#34;beach smell&#34; added in.<br /><br />I ended up contacting the Amazon support center and explaining the situation. They were awesome. Refunded my order and sent me another one (I explained that it may have been a knockoff). However, it smelled the same, which it to say like garbage. I wish it were somewhat tolerable since the price is so great. I really could use a nice, causal, summer cologne. Well, live and learn.	2015-08-02

This was my first time trying a clinical strength deodorant and I am absolutely hooked! I live in Phoenix, which as you probably know, gets to be pretty toasty in the summers. I had previously been using a &#34;regular&#34; deodorant and found myself applying it liberally in the mornings, and then re-applying in the afternoons. I decided to try Secret  Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant and was instantly amazed by how much more effective it is compared to my old brand. I apply it once in the morning after showering, and I'm fresh all day long. No &#34;sticky pit&#34; feeling, no funk. It even holds up through my hour-long kickboxing class. I'm officially a convert! I received a free sample that I suspect will last me quite a while, but I will absolutely be buying more when it runs out!	2015-08-02

It does provide good coverage, it does keep my face from being shiny even during the hot summer days. It does work pretty nicely, indeed.<br />But it's not my favourite.<br />I know that to be able to do the before mentioned things it has to be of a thick consistency, but that does also mean that it's not the easiest product to apply and you definitely can 'feel' it on your skin during the day. The packaging also doesn't help much. The product is too thick to actually flow out of the bottle and you need a little spatula to take it out which means being a little more messier and uncomfortable than usual.<br />Yet it does what it promises. So if you want good coverage, good lasting times and a pretty nice matte finish at a very affordable price this is probably the product for you!	2015-08-02

My only complaint would be that they take a while to dry, even in a well ventilated area, but that's not specific to just this brand.

These are the pins I've always searched for.  I have very thick long hip length hair that is coarse.  I've always preferred wearing my hair up in buns, especially at work.  While I was in the military, this hairstyle was required.  I've always had an extremely hard time finding pins that could keep my hair up and in place, especially during a lot of movement, as I was expected to run and do physical activities with my hair up.  I've went through so many pins over the years that only lasted a few weeks, if not days.  They'd bend while putting them in, or come out the bun distorted.  Some would even pop out on their own during the day.  Most could not hold my hair up, or in place.  I came across these pins during a search for hair accessories and didn't try them out because I was convinced I needed black hairpins to match my hair color.  I finally decided to purchase these after coming home from work the other day to find my bun out of place and a few pins missing from my hair.  I normally would use 10-12 of the Goody or Scunci brand hairpins and they would warp within the first couple of uses.  With these pins, I use 10, but think I could use as few as 8 if I wanted.  They slide in smoothly and hold extremely well.  My bun feels so secure during the day; there's absolutely no movement or slippage.  When I take them out at the end of the day, they come out looking the exact way as they were put in.  There's no warping or bending of the metal.  Because they slide in so well, they are completely hidden once put into place, so the fact that these are silver in color is of no consequence.  I absolutely love these hairpins!  My only regret is not getting them sooner, or when I was in the military, because these could've saved me so much time!  I highly recommend these if you have thick, long, coarse, or dark hair.  These are excellently made and will last a very long time.	2015-08-02

I would normally use a product longer than 2 weeks before writing a review but this Argan Oil is so amazing I couldn't wait. I did purchase this product at a reduced price to intice ratings but I will honestly say than when I finish this bottle I will GLADLY pay full price again! I have told all my firneds about it! My hair has become so soft and shiny in the last 2 weeks my fiance has commented unpromted on how great it looks, I have even had strangers in the store comment on how shiny it is. This has never happened to me before, my hair has always been pretty plain dirty blond. I have never dyed it but it has alot of sun and ponytail/bun style damage. I have noticed a big difference in its strength and resistance to hair tie crinkles since using this product. I would normally never use a oil based product in my hair but just a few drops smoothed through wet hair does the trick. This product has been a true beauty miracle! I can't wait to see how my hair looks after I have used it longer. Truly recommend it!	2015-08-02

Receive A Set Of FREE False Eyelashes with Every Purchase ! (Eyelash Glue Not Included)	Beauty	5	4	4	N	N	So far so good	This was purchased by a friend for me.<br />I was skeptical when we were first placing the order. But I thought why not? So it arrived last week and I have been using it nightly before bed (as the instructions say). I haven't had any negative side effects so far. This is why I am always leery of ordering eye products because they go on your eyes. But this doesn't burn or anything. It goes on wet and clear. I wait for it to dry some before laying down, as I don't want it to get wiped off.<br />So far I haven't noticed a difference but it has only been a week and the box clearly states three weeks.<br />So I will update my review in a couple weeks to let you know the results. But so far currently I am pleased with this product.	2015-08-02

But only applying to your lips you don't need more than a finger tip amount each time. So a little goes a very long way.

I am 40+ and typically have dry skin but monthly will have a blemish deep under the skin or a small red spot. If I apply this product at night and again in the morning prior to work, this will help diminish the blemish (or bring to the surface). The product works a little better than a competitor product, Burt's Bees blemish roller. I will order this again but warn consumers to cleanse your face prior to rolling on to skin as bacteria, dead skin cells, dirt, makeup, etc, will collect inside the bottle from rolling. I found the competitor product to collect debris within a couple uses verses Skin By Ann Webb product (formula of skin By Ann Webb is different).	2015-08-02

I had some pretty painful abrasions on my face for about three days after my first use. If there would have been an instructional video I probably would have avoided that. That being said, the machines does seem to have very good suction and probably works if you do it correctly and do not over do it or you will suffer from abrasions. I am going to try it again in seven days. I didn't notice a healthy glow through the abrasions.my face actually looked horrible for three days. I reviewed every machine that was affordable and the Kendal is supposed to be the best. We will see.	2015-08-02

I did not purchase the product from Amazon, and so am not knocking the company (my favorite site) or the seller. But, I felt strongly that anyone should know what happened to me. I'm hoping that I am a rare case. My decision to stop using relaxers was made because over the past 6 months I've been experiencing extreme hair thinning. I used this item 2 days ago in the shower, leaving it in for about 10 minutes while I showered. I experienced SO much hair fall, it was unbelievable and very stressful. I literally was pulling handfuls of strands of hair out. This is Day 2, and I'm still losing hair like crazy. Literally pulling it out. Hoping this will stop. It's  very stressful. I've never had anything like this happen before. It was also very drying for my hair and even contributed to knotting. I'll update if the hair fall stops.	2015-08-02

I will start it up - put it into my mouth and it just dies - so my mouth doesn't get clean that night - if there was some kind of warning - I could re-charge it before it gets to that point.<br />I guess I have to recommend it - since my hygenist recommended it to me.	2015-08-02

I can't speak to it's ingredients being all-natural, but I can certainly affirm it's effectiveness in bringing soft, silkiness to hair. I am in a transition stage, going &#34;no-poo&#34;, and my hair has been very dry and tangly. Since I began using this product a few days ago, my hair instantly became healthy feeling again.<br /><br />I also want to make a point to laud its LOVELY SCENT. In fact, as I was sitting here at my computer writing and working, I kept sniffing my hair with joy, until I decided I would go ahead and give it a great review on Amazon. When I was looking to make the purchase, I had hoped someone would try to describe the smell, but I didn't find it. I shall attempt to describe it now: earthy, warm, like sweet toasted coconut on a banana cream pie. It doesn't smell anything like a tanning lotion as my description might sound, but more like warm vanilla cookies baking in the fall. Whatever it is, it smells great, and it's relaxing and subtle enough not to be overwhelming at all.<br /><br />I am now going to purchase the 3-pack and make this a daily part of my hair care.	2015-08-02

I really liked how I could use them ( still have yet to use all ) and they did pretty good of showing up on my dark brown hair. Though they showed best when it was wet. The only downside is, it really killed the ends of my hair! I had never used hair chalk before, this was a first time for me, but I was not expecting them to be so drying!	2015-08-02

I just got home from vacation and my lips were very neglected from being  in the sun and not drinking enough water.  I opened the pack and noticed there weren't any instructions of how to prep prior to using or how often to use.  I wasn't sure if i were to stir prior to applying, so i didn't the first time. It made a mess, but it did get rid of dry skin on my lips. I chose to use every morning. The second day I stired prior to using. This made more of a mess. The oils got on outside of jar and i almost dropped whole containe,but continued to smooth my lips.  It tasted sweet, but not sure I'd say chocolate. Almost a maple syrup smell/taste.  I can't wait to see how this continues to work. I received this at a promotional price in return for my unbiased opinion but I feel like not only is the lip scrub functional, it taste yummy too.	2015-08-02

This salon cape is a nicer cape then the ones I have purchased in the past. It fits very comfortably around the neck and doesn't irritate your skin or chock you. It is made with nice fabric which I am in love with and it has buttons that snap together in the back that do not show. When cutting hair, the hair just slips right off the fabric onto the floor. It is by far a better cape then going to a beauty store and getting one. Very happy with this purchase and I recommend this cape to all the hair dressers out there.

I'm highly impressed with them. These are perfect for the summer time. I haven't really found anything wrong with these Temporary Tattoos. Well at least nothing that sticks out to me. The colors are very shiny after you put them on. My favorite out of the 8 sheets were the sun and moon one.<br /><br />Applying them is as easy as 1 2 3. It's just like putting on those temporary tattoos you used to get when you were a child. I find that the tattoos last a lot longer when you clean your skin first before applying the tattoo. They usually last for about a week or so.<br /><br />How to apply:<br />1. Clean the area of the skin well.<br />2. Find the tattoo you want. Cut it out and peel off the plastic protector sheet.<br />3. Place the tattoo facing down and in the position you want.<br />4. Place a damp, warm rag or sponge on top of the tattoo and firmly hold it for about 30 seconds.<br />5. Remove the rag or sponge and slowly and gently remove the wet paper away from your skin.<br />6. Let the tattoo dry for about 2-3 minutes before touching it.<br />7. Now go out and show off your new tattoo!!<br /><br />To remove:<br />Taking them off is very easy too. Just use a little bit of baby oil and rub gently and viola! The tattoos come off.<br /><br />My daughter, little cousins, brother and nephew was ecstatic to see that I got these. My daughter already has put claim on some of the tattoos. And my little brother and nephew took more of the boy looking ones and used those. They absolutely love these tattoos.<br /><br />Overall, I thought these are some fun, awesome, eye-catching tattoos. They are shiny and you're sure to stand out in the crowd. I'd recommend these for sure.<br /><br />**I received this product free or deeply discounted in exchange for my honest opinion.

I generally uses Pantene's curl gel but after seeing a review of Miss Jessie's I gave it a go and I'm totally in love.  Pantene tends to leave a bit of crunch in the curl if I'm not obsessive about towel drying the curls.  When I first tried Miss Jessie's I was exhausted so I just slapped some in my wet hair and went straight to bed. I woke up with absolutely perfect curls, with no crunch! Thinking this had to be a fluke I tried the product again and went through the whole towel dry rigmarole and was even happier with the way they came out. Loads of volume, perfect big spirals.  There was some leftover frizz from the friction of towel drying but a bit of B&B invisible oil fixed that.  This is really an amazing product. It doesn't weigh my curls down at all, it's scentless, it doesn't leave a residue or cake the curls together creating Medusa-like crunchy curls.  I just wound up with soft shiny spirals. So happy with this product, and at such a low price I'm totally going to stock up!	2015-08-02

I am so glad I tried Nexxus Deep Conditioner. It leaves my difficult hair soft but manageable.  I have fine gray hair that is difficult to style.  Ive been a fan of Nexxus products for a long time so I wasn't surprised that I liked this conditioner.  I like too use it on a day when I'm going to be home most of the day.  I shampoo and towel dry my hair before putting about a tablespoon of it in my hair.  I like to leave it for several hours even though it's probably not necessary.  After a warm water rinse out I blow dry and style my hair.  It's wonderful to have found this great product.	2015-08-02

This Pen works well and does what it sais it will do, they are easy to use; I just use some gause in the botton of my mouth for absorbtion and petroleum jelly on the lips for sensitive people, but it really does not bother you at all and you just leave the product on your teeth when finished.  The pen is lacking product and that is why they are so inexpensive I presume, it takes about 70 clicks of the dial before any product even starts to come out. I don't know how well the little uv light works if you decide to buy one for 2.00, but why not get one for any extra help with the process. Overall, I will buy another again due the time saving factor to others because of its high concentration; I don't have to leave the product on or undisturbed for more than about 10 to 15 minutes to get the benefits. I noticed results within just 2 days and gained about 4 to 6 shades whiter.	2015-08-02

I recieved this free for review. I have sensitive skin so I cant use a lot of things on my skin. But this soap is gentle that it doesn't break my skin out but harsh on my black heads and breakouts which I love. I use a charcoal face wash and now I'm glad I can use charcoal on the rest of my body now. The soap smell is really strong in my opinion when I first got it. The soap smells like those lemon girls scoot cookies. But what I like is that even though the smell is strong on the soap it's not as strong when it's on your body. Which is excellent for me because I can't take strong perfume smells. This soap is great it makes your body feel really clean.	2015-08-02

I used it in my diffuser right away. It sure doesn't smell like carrots to me! That's probably good. I detected a hint of cinnamon & overall an earthy musky smell. It probably smells different to others because I had a bout with Bells Palsy that changed/killed off a lot of my taste & smell. I am going to try it in my bath & on my face next.

My skin broke out all over my legs with a red rash that itched terribly. I don't know if I'm allergic to something in it or what. I've used other cheaper bath bombs and had no problems. Does lush add clay to their bombs? It plugged my drain. I had to use drain-o and use a snake. There was some gray jell type stuff that looked like clay in some areas out of my drain. I will never order this product and asked my BF to not buy this product again. He tried his best to do something nice for me.	2015-08-02

I couldn't find any of my local stores so I turned Amazon and voilà there it was, ranging  in price from approximately five dollars a bottle up to $20-$30 a bottle. I'm fairly frugal so I went low-end and bought the simple water and after using it for a month I am very pleased with it. I simply saturate some flat cotton  pads with the micellar water and rub the pads across my face, and all my make up is removed. I don't wear a ton of make up, but I do wear bareMinerals powder foundation, and Christian Dior mascara. Both products came off very easily with the micellar water. It feels like tapwater; there's no fragrance to it and it doesn't foam up which took some getting used to, but it gets my face 90% clean, and I use it which is the best part of all. I'm one of those lazy gals that will sleep in my make up more often than not, but this stuff is so easy and effective that it was easy to work into my routine. Finding it in a three pack made it easy for me to stock up; if only it were available on Subscribe  and Save - then it would be perfect. Give it a try, you won't be sorry you did.	2015-08-02

Beauty	5	3	3	N	N	Super Sun protection without any harsh chemicals!!	We are lucky enough to have our own pool at home. But owning a pool also comes the flow of several kids in and out of your pool daily! I also have a 12 month and and have an in home daycare. So sunscreen is a must around my house and we use large amounts of it! I am always cautious of the brands I choose, and the SPF for my children, especially my infant. I started using Tender Sprout Organic Sunblock this weekend and I am very please with how affective the product is. In the past I have used products and they caused my babies eyes to become read, runny, and irritated. Which in turn causes him to be super grouchy and uncomfortable. So I would try to apply less in those sensitive areas to only have him burn. With the Tender Sprouts Organic sunscreen i am able to apply it generously to his face and ear area, and he has no bad effects from it! It hasn't burnt his eyes, or left him with irritated in any area. It also kept him from being sunburnt, which to me is the best part! He was in the water for several hours, and I didn't have to reapply it any and it protected him all day. I feel so good about<br />using the Tender Sprouts Organic sunscreen because I know there are no harsh chemicals in it, and it protects my children from the harmful rays of sun. I love the fact that this product provides chemical free, fragrance free protection for my child and I will be using more of this product in the future, because it's proven to be a company I can trust! I received this product at a discount price in exchange fore my honest, unbiased review. The price has nothing to do with my opinion of the product.	2015-08-02

Before buying this Jojoba Oil I had heard all of the benefits of using it. The main reason I decided to give it a try was for my poor hair! My hair is very thin and very greasy. Because my hair becomes greasy very quickly and easily after washing it I have to sacrafice conditioner as it tends to leave my hair even more greasy. Not being able to use conditioner leaves my hair very dry and to make matters worse I straighten it close to 6 times a week and my scalp because very itch due to the dryness.<br /><br />The first thing I did once I ripped open my jojoba oil was wash my hair then apply this to my scalp and working my way down to my roots. I was so amazed at how well my hair reacted to the jojoba oil. I didn't expect it to do anything other than make my hair more oily but surprisingly it calmed my itchy scalp, moisturized my dry strands and didn't leave my hair oily like conditioner!<br /><br />I also noticed that jojoba could be used to help with razor burn and since I already had it I figured why not. Now I get razor burn each time I shave, I know lucky me. I have tried tea tree oil with no success and again I really didn't expect the jojoba oil to do much. I did have to apply it a few times over the course of the hour before swimming but it really helped to reduce the razor burn. Even if it didn't help with the razor but my skin sure loved the smooth feeling it left! Such a great multi use oil! *I received this product free/discounted in exchange for my review. My reviews are completely honest and 100% my own.*	2015-08-02

I carefully opened one over the sink and only used maybe a third of the contents (still had leftover dye) and taped the other half of the capsule for later use. My only issue was that it dyed my eyebrows much darker than I wanted. I have dark blonde hair and having nearly black eyebrows looks a bit strange to me! Next time I will do one eyebrow at a time and quickly remove the dye after 30 seconds or so. If I want it darker, I'll repeat. There's plenty of dye after all...	2015-08-02

Updated review for Amazon purchase of this lotion to caution new purchasers. I reordered same item 3 different times hoping to get a bottle that pumped white lotion and was fragrance-free. This lotion is great, but make sure it's not a yellowish color. I bought one that had a bad odor and the lotion itself came out of the pump a discolored yellow. Wrote Amazon to inform of bad batch and need for quality assurance, but no reply. If you've used this lotion before, you know it's supposed to be white and has no fragrance. I originally tried to be fair and gave it 4 stars for its potential even though I had to return. I then ordered two more; these also being discolored and smelled yucky. After the inconvenience of returning more bottles that were bad, I decided to knock review to 1 star to warn customers. If you purchase at local stores, the lotion is white and is free of odor. It is a good product so hopefully Amazon will rectify problem.	2015-08-02

Beauty is in your eyes and when they look tired and darkness around them you look older than you really are and this Eye Gel helps that area with time.

You will see the results start in three weeks and then you notice how good the eyes are looking after applying your make, no puffiness for me at all. The ANAITI'S EYE GEL does work. I would like to invite you to follow my blog for the month of August 2015 and I will show even more how my eyes are changing.

It does what it claimed to do, but as soon as you make any kind of facial movement, it stops working. I've also found that you can't use liquid foundation with it because it stops working. If you put it on over moisturizer it doesn't work at all.  It also leaves a film under your eyes after a few hours.  All in all, this product would be good for a man who doesn't want to wear makeup or a women who doesn't want to wear make up and enjoys resting b***h face all day, every day.	2015-08-02

It's a little difficult to get used to at first and there is a lot of trouble shooting at the beginning. When I very first tried it I thought it was broken because only air would come out. But I persevered and ended up with a flawless face. I have only used it 3 times so far but I already have the hang of it and it looks amazing, everyone noticed a change in my face. For those that may say it broke after one or two uses, I suggest reading through the trouble shooting page in the included packet, because many of your issues are actually very simple fixes. The one thing I do warn is that this machine is exceptionally fragile and WILL NOT WORK if the needle is bent in the slightest during cleaning. So BE CAREFUL. But besides that detail the machine is wonderful and I absolutely love the results. I think everyone who is considering should go out and get one.	2015-08-02

The results were noticeable after about 30 days (using as directed morning and night). I have seen a slight reduction in the vertical lines between my eyebrows and the &#34;crows feet&#34; at the corners of my eyes as well as an overall improvement in the texture of the my skin.  Please note:  I have very realistic expectations.  I am 55 years old and I do not want or expect my skin to look like I am 40. The consistency is different from other serums as it is liquid and not creamy.  That is a plus for me because when followed (as directed) by eye cream and a moisturizer, other serums cause too much oiliness.  The bottom line:  this a an excellent product and a GREAT value if you have realistic expectations about what to expect from any beauty treatment.	2015-08-02

I have quite a few HD powders.  I have rosacea skin, so it's extremely sensitive.  I was really hoping to fall in love with the It Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores HD Micro Finishing Loose Powder and I am on the fence.  It does blur the pores, it does a real nice job finishing.  I love the color of it.  It's the scent that bothers me and I think bothers my face.  The pot is a good size, but be careful as the product does tend to fly off easily as it is very light in texture.  My only complaint is the scent.  If it did not have the scent it would be almost equal to my favorite HD powder.  I do recommend it highly if you do not have rosacea skin or are bothered by scented products.	2015-08-02

The rotary shavers give great coverage, but the shave is not as close.  I find that the Remington foil shaver does give a good close shave with pretty good coverage too.  It has a trimmer, which is useful.  It has one negative. It can not be run while it is plugged in and charging. So, it has to be kept charged.<br /><br />P.S. After 18 months of satisfactory use, February 2017, I have found that the battery of the razor holds just enough charge for one shave. I think that the battery should do better than that.	2015-08-02

But Wash Your Face Afterward!	I love this tanning lotion! It smells great and has natural bronzers but doesn't look streaky. The color of the lotion itself is brown. It has a slight shimmer too, which I love. I feel like I use more of this than of other tanning lotions...I feel like it soaks in pretty well and doesn't sit on your skin. One small issue I had with this lotion is that it causes blemishes on my face if I don't wash it off right after tanning. Sometimes I go tanning over my lunch and I'd usually forget to wash my face until before bed many hours later. I simply bought a travel size face wash that I keep in my purse now...problem solved. My last tanning lotion with bronzer would leave streaks on my clothes but this one does not. I'd highly recommend this lotion...and here on Amazon it is about half the price that my tanning salon wants me to pay!	2015-08-02

It is part of Almay's green eye products but I haven't been able to find it in stores lately at all. Thus the reason for my online purchase. It was cheaper online than in stores but shipping wasn't free so it was about the same with that included. The color is really pretty...it's like a purplish-red which sounds strange but it looks really great on, especially if you use the eyeliner and shadows for green eyes along with it. I've actually had other women ask me about it after seeing it on. Highly recommended. I use BareMinerals for foundation but everything else is Almay. I have sensitive skin and their products have never caused any irritation.	2015-08-02

I like that this is natural and free of harmful chemicals. I find I have to use very little, only 4-5 drops. If I apply it to one part of my hair, that part will look greasy later. I find it looks better if I add a little water and then rub it in. It is really effective at controlling frizz and keeping my hair smoother.	2015-08-02

I have been using over-the-counter Retinal  products for many years. Six months ago I started using Retriderm Serum Plus .75%. At first I was afraid my skin would peel and scabby by starting off with .75% strength but I had no problem with this level, possibly because of years of using retinal creams and serums of a milder strength? My skin looks clear, bright and has a youthful glow. I am in my 60's (on the far side) but recently during a convention several people told me my complexion was that of a 40 year old.<br /><br />This product works very well and very quickly - if you have sensitive skin, you may want to start out at the lower level: .5% as recommended by dermatologists; however, I used this product every 3 days for the first two weeks then switched to every other day with absolutely no peeling.<br /><br />I am now ready to purchase the 1% Retriderm Serum Max. I will review it in 6 weeks and am certain if the results are the same for .75% I will give it 5 stars as well.	2015-08-02

Okay, not too many things you'll hear me say this about, what with me being a rationalist and all, but this stuff is MAGIC!<br /><br />I almost didn't write this review, because I'm only going to repeat what so many others have said, but turns out, I am so amazed I can't stifle myself, so here goes:<br /><br />Among other charmingnesses that I've noticed since ('scuse me for getting personal here, but) menopause arrived, is that my skin is going wacko. The relevant example here is that after years of accepting smooth skin as only natural, all of a sudden my forearms turned into something akin to those spiky things put up to discourage drivers from escaping police during chases, or driving the wrong way out of parking garages.<br /><br />I don't know why, out of all the changes, this is the one that bugged me, but it did-- enough to look online to try to figure out what was up with it. I succeeded, and discovered it's something called keratosis pilosis, or KP for short (why something so unendearing earns a nickname is beyond me; I'd prefer to call it yukskin, but that's just me, I guess).<br /><br />The reason I'm going into such detail is so that if any of you out there have the same thing and are wondering if this might succeed in returning your skin to its former state, you'll know that my experience might be relevant, and the answer is a great big glorious YES!<br /><br />I could feel a change from-- get this-- the first application.<br /><br />Mind you, it didn't make the bumps vanish at that point...but it did make them, for lack of a better description, less spiky.<br /><br />It seemed to me that, day by day, they were gradually and consistently improving, but I didn't trust this impression, chalking it up to wishful thinking...or maybe to having been brainwashed by having read the other reviews here.<br /><br />Well, it's been three weeks, and there's no longer any arguing with the results: although my skin is not as it was pre-menopause, in that there are still bumps, they are much smaller, and there is zero spikiness (meaning, the bumps are now neither hard nor sharp).<br /><br />And even this is not totally accurate, because-- how odd is this?-- it's actually only my right arm that still has any bumps at all. My left really is just smooth, which I'm hoping might be a harbinger of things to come for the laggard arm.<br /><br />Since I am continuing, still, after three weeks, to see improvement as I daily apply this stuff, my guess would be that eventually both arms will be as they were in their days of glory (okay, after all this, I have to admit, I don't really care all that much about the state of my arms, and probably wouldn't have even noticed it but for the fact that I evidently have a habit of rubbing my arms while driving and stopped at lights, for want, I guess, of anything more edifying to do (I refuse to be one of those people who uses their phone or tablet behind the wheel, don't get me started), and was, one day, suddenly shocked to discover this whole armSpikes thing out of nowhere).<br /><br />So, while I obviously can't guarantee that anyone else will have the same happy experience I've had with this product, I would certainly say it's worth giving it a shot if you, like me, grew tired of risking hand injury while rubbing your arm (or whatever), because I swear, it worked like magic for me.<br /><br />Further affiant sayeth naught.	2015-08-02

Trying new cleansers was always so nerve wracking for me because I would wake up with either redness or breakouts. This cleanser has become my lifeline for about two years.

As a three time melanoma survivor,  I was happy to receive this sunscreen as a product review.  I also have four tween age daughters (ages 9, 10, 11 and 13) who are very active and we go through a great deal of sunscreen in our house.  I have taken my time to really put this sunscreen to the test and I love it and highly recommend it!  This is what I found:<br />Pros: Is it effective? YES! I put this lotion to the test in various situations.  At the pool, beach, gardening, boating, zoo trip, etc.  It was effective in every situation, even if not reapplied after a few hours.  (I always reapply but getting Tweens to do so is not easy.)<br />Is it easy to apply? Absolutely!  I tend to use spray sunscreen because of how quick and easy they are to use with a busy schedule and multiple children.  Many lotions tend to be thick and hard to apply.  NOT this sunscreen.  It has a great consistency, not too thick or thin and rubs in with ease!  My busy kids were even able to apply it without help! And a bonus is that it has a nice, very light scent.<br />Is it good for sensitive skin? YES!  This was a major pro for us.  Two of my daughters have extremely sensitive skin and easily have rashes/breakouts from other sunscreens. Both girls had no problems at all with this lotion.  In fact, it is now their lotion of choice and the only one they want to use!<br /><br />Cons-The only con I have is the price.  This is priced higher than the sunscreen we tend to buy at the drugstore.  I was skeptical that I would actually rebuy after my review bottle was gone.  However, I discovered that this tube lasts MUCH longer than our normal sunscreen.  I was surprised at the number of applications we got out of one tube.  I will definitely be buying more in our future.  It has become over favorite sunscreen!	2015-08-02

I have dry skin and have at time developed eczema, but I bought this lotion in hopes of improving the KP, keratosis pilaris, on my arms.  After 1.5 months of daily use, I have seen no improvement in my KP.  Yes, it is a lotion, but not any better than the many many lotions I've tried and certainly not better than the ones I make myself.<br />The good: their a faint smell, that dissipates quickly (not at all a problem), and while it's heavy, I have found it absorbs well without being sticky (even in the midst of a humid summer).  It is a good lotion.<br />The mediocre:  as stated, this a good lotion, but I don't think it's worth the price tag.  It didn't have any noticeable effect on my KP, and it's unlikely I'd buy it again.	2015-08-02

It did a great job of cleaning and didn't smell too manly.<br />I found it did seem to add a little volume too.  Can't really say whether the caffeine makes a difference or not, but it did perform well.<br /><br />I do have some scented shampoos and conditioners on the shelf that I know my husband will not use.  Once those are used up, I'll steer clear of buying body care products whose scent is too feminine or too masculine.  It's better to have products on hand that can be used by both of us.<br />Even though this product is marketed for men, the light, musky scent that doesn't linger makes it something that can be used by both of us.<br /><br />The four stars instead of five is because I really prefer to reduce the number of bottles needed in the shower and usually purchase 3 in 1 products.  Since this is only shampoo, someone with longer hair will still need to apply a conditioner for detangling.	2015-08-02

I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging, with the silver base and the clear cap, I was able to see the color of the lipstick immediately.  When I applied the product, it went on smoothly and evenly.  I did not need to apply a balm or primer before using this lipstick.  The color was a bit too pink for my complexion, but I would try another shade in the line.  Overall, I thought the product lasted well throughout the day.  It did need to be reapplied after eating or drinking but it didn't wear off unevenly and leave the dreaded &#34;lip liner&#34; look.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a long-wearing, moisturizing product.	2015-08-02

This is a very nice cold cream type cleanser that removes makeup and gently exfoliates. Just keep it out of your eyes as it won't be too pleasant if you get this in there. I'm not a fan of topical AHA as it usually reddens my skin or burns, but this doesn't seem to affect it that way at all.

Though I admit I often forget this step, I know it's super important to use some type of setting powder (or spray) whenever you use liquid or cream foundation to help keep it in place and stave off oily shine. When I recently ran out of the bareminerals mineral veil I've always used in the past, a friend recommended this stuff from Maybelline, and WOW! I seriously have no reason to go back to bareminerals. This stuff from Maybelline works just the same, is 1/3rd the price, and comes in a bigger container.<br /><br />A few things I want to note:<br />1) this comes with an application puff that fits inside the container. While this is nice to have, I get much more even results using a brush. I just feel like a brush is better at spreading a thin layer of this stuff evenly without disturbing your not-quite-dry liquid or cream foundation underneath. The easiest way to do this is to just tap some of the product into the blue cap, swirl it with the brush, and apply.<br />2) This has very little color to it (which is what most people want in a setting powder, but just in case..). Even though it looks like any powder foundation when it's in the container, it's very, very fine so it's not going to cover your imperfections like a foundation would. However, it can definitely be used by itself if you have particularly oily skin and just want to keep the shine at bay. And on that note, if you're using this as a setting powder over your liquid or cream foundation, you don't have to worry too much about this being an exact color match since it's almost translucent when using a very thin layer.	2015-08-02

Reapplying every two hours is not sufficient. I reapplied every 45 minutes and neither myself nor my daughter got burned in Hawaii. However, I found this excessively sticky and difficult to remove, and if playing in sand, the sand became impossible to get off. It was as bad as Blue Lizard.  I went back to Neutrogena and found it much easier to apply, remove, and I didn't have to reapply every 45 minutes. I wouldn't get this again.	2015-08-02

This means not moving, not sweating, not showering, treating the area where the patch is adhered with &#34;kid gloves&#34;: once that patch falls off, you're in for a few days of worse pain and, if it can get even better, sudden withdrawal from the strongest opioid available on the market! Smith And Nephew Flexifix solved that problem! I apply the patch and apply a piece of the Flexifix that is larger along all four sides (rounding the corners to avoid catching clothing), and I've never lost a patch since I've switched from Tegaderm. It's much easier to work with, as well. Give it a try! It is SO much simpler. A bonus for those with diabetes: it holds the constant glucose monitors with no bother at all either!	2015-08-02

Its possible that no difference is a good thing because at least the hair is not getting thinner.  If the hair would grow in more, it would get five stars.

My husband’s feeling, and I agree, is that this is basically a body wash that you can kind of use as a shampoo and conditioner. It’s not the best hair care product, but it works fine. It’s better for short hair. If you have longer hair, it’s best to use an actual shampoo.	2015-08-02

Why? Because the bristles become way too soft and ineffective after only a few weeks of use. They might look fine, but my teeth aren't clean after brushing. My thought was that those who aren't as aware of how their teeth should feel might not realize that they aren't performing adequate hygiene. And some reviews here seem to reflect this. Luckily, there were quite a few brushes in the package I purchased so each brush gets its few weeks then is tossed in the trash. Also, the outer bristles are too long and the flatter middle bristles don't quite contact the flatter tooth surfaces. In order cleanse all surfaces it's sometimes necessary to push down harder on the longer bristles which could create damage to the sulcus (shallow &#34;collar&#34; around the tooth) in time.	2015-08-02

I spend more time reading the negative reviews for a product than the positive reviews as I wonder how many of the positive  are legit reviews. (question all reviews to some extent)<br />Everything I read about this sounded like what I was looking for.  I am NOT disappointed.  Instructions are clearly explained and simple.  I added my favorite oils, plugged it in, and the vapors came out within 30 seconds and the smell filled the large room.  It runs easily for over 5 hours before more water needs to be added.<br />Bought 2 additional InstaNatural diffusers for our bedroom and for husbands office.  We just plug it in and it sends out the vapors and oils instantly.<br />If I had any critique of a less than A+ rating it would be that I wish it ran for 8-10 hours.  (Larger water  reservoir).  Perhaps they will make a larger version in the future.  :-).  If so I would be the first to purchase this.<br />  Also, automatically shuts off when water  reservoir is empty.  Just another thing I love about this product!!!	2015-08-02

The texture is pretty gross--heavy and greasy and it separated after two weeks so I almost didn't feel bad tossing it. A waste of money.	2015-08-02

The case is nice and sturdy. The brush attachment is soft and gentle, yet effective. The massage attachment (one with 4 rolling balls) felt very nice when used with my nourishing mask. Although the balls are hard plastic, they were surprisingly gentle. I have not yet tried the other two attachments, but I have inspected them and they look to be as sturdy and well made as the other two attachments.  The motorized handle is lightweight yet solid.  It has worked well so far and shows no signs of quitting any time soon.  While on high, it's quite a little work horse!  My skin feels completely exfoliated and new, however if I'm not careful and stop soon enough, I can go too far and cause agitation. So it is certainly capable in high speed. In low speed it is gentle, yet effective in keeping pore clogging dead skin cells and gunk in check.  I will be honest, in low, it doesn't take much pressure to slow/bog it down. Personally, I'm not deterred by this. It serves as a reminder not to be too rough on my delicate skin. Plus, what else would you expect from a device that only requires 2 small batteries and costs less than $30??  Regardless, it certainly gets the job done in my opinion and I have no delusions of it working for years and years. If I get 4 to 6 months use out of this thing, I got my money's worth.  I am satisfied with my purchase and I got exactly what I was looking for in a product. For the price I paid, I feel I got a good deal too.  I've been using this for about two weeks and the batteries are still going strong with daily use.  If my opinion changes,  I will update this review.	2015-08-02

This blush, Rosy Outlook, was what she used on my cheeks and it looked so great.  A light peachy pink shade that is really perfect for my pale skin.  It goes on light but is totally buildable.  It is a little expensive but worth it in my opinion to find that perfect blush shade.	2015-08-02

Approved Snorkeling and Scuba Diving Sunscreen!	Beauty	1	1	2	N	Y	Limited Use - Not Very Effective Outside of Water	I bought this product to go snorkeling in Cancun.  It did seem to adhere to the skin pretty well.  I even had trouble scrubbing it off my skin afterwards, in the shower.  However outside of the water the product seemed useless, unless you want to walk around looking like a ghost.  It seems it only blocks the sun if you apply it and leave it as a thick white paste.  (I called it my &#34;geisha&#34; sunscreen.)  I rubbed it a bit on my skin to avoid the ghost appearance, and my skin burned after walking around for a while.  Then when you start to sweat, it would drip and run, and leave pink trails on your arms and legs.<br /><br />So, perhaps it is good for the coral in the water.  But bring another sunscreen when you are out of the water.	2015-08-02

If I scratch my arm, I will have nail marks from where I scratch. Because of this, shaving my legs often is an issue because they get very irritated. On top of that, I have a type of eczema that also makes it difficult.<br /><br />I purchased the intuition razor previously and was still having issues. I came across the sensitive refills and decided that I really needed to try these as it could be my solution and I am SO happy I did.<br /><br />Ever since using these refills, I am able to shave as often as I would like without having any adverse reactions. My legs are smooth and soft again.<br /><br />My only downfall is that I feel like the bottom half of the razor always goes quicker than the top which makes me feel like I am wasting half of the razor towards the end. However, that is not nearly enough for me ton stray away from using these. Any one with sensitive skin should definitely look into these.	2015-08-02

It's a good product because it makes your hair much softer and shiner.  I've been having trouble with frizzy hair lately and this has been helping a little bit with that.  While I do recommend it, I just wish it was a bit stronger in the frizz protect part because the weather, where I live, is a mix of crazy: humidity goes from high to low; heat is very high (during Mid-Spring through Mid-Fall); and makes it seem like I never comb my hair.  I might try something else, not sure yet. Still deciding.  But not too bad overall!	2015-08-02

It did improve my wrinkles but after a while, there was no more improvement. So I saw this product having a whooping 2.5% retinol and decided to try it. It  was not magic thus did not work overnight, but after 2 months, I can tell it has improved my facial wrinkles. Especially, the wrinkles around my eyes have reduced about 50%. This is very encouraging, considering eye skin is the most delicate and prone to wrinkles part on your face. I hope it will continue to improve my skin as I keep using it.	2015-08-02

Knowing what you apply to the skin for little or no problems is important, it leaves nothing behind but after applying you will notice your skin after a few applications how soft the skin is and firmer as well.

The top coat does dry in 43 seconds as described and the base coat is of equal quality.  You can't beat the price and I would say this brand out-shines the more expensive products.  And the polish applicator is a bit wider and glides across your nails smoothly.  Definitely a keeper.	2015-08-02

Ultra Moisture Magnet Serum 50X Hyaluronic Acid has a unique non-equilibrium gel structure with gel domains that bounds the water tightly. The formula creates a film on the layer of the skin and transports this water over time. The 50X Strength of the Hyaluronic Acid makes it more potent and provides maximum water binding capacity.<br /><br />One single application of this HA makes the skin look a lot younger, radiant and even-toned. Using this moisturizer/serum the skin would be dramatically plumped and lifted with incredible moisture.<br />This Serum is GENTLE, EFFECTIVE & SAFE for all skin types; including those with sensitive skin.<br /><br />Vegan, Paraben-free, oil-free, no dyes, no fragrances or fillers, Oily Skin remedy<br />- Rejuvenates the look of dull skin for a smoother, more even skin tone<br />- Helps in fighting with the dryness /redness on face with professional hydration<br />- Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles<br />- Fights with the dark circles under the eyes and the eye puffiness<br /><br />50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can hold 4,000 to 5,000 times its own weight in water. As it binds water to it, the individual molecules expand. This inflation of the Serum on a molecular level helps to plump the skin. It hydrates the skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and gives you a healthy, plump, smooth and glowing appearance. The amazing plumping abilities of 50 x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can be demonstrated with a dried apricot. After a few hours' immersions in a beaker of the ingredient, a dried apricot will hydrate and plump back to its original shape and my wife totally swears by this product,<br />wrinkle removing and prevention that is too Frankenstein like for me but what ever it takes for the bride to keep from looking like broom Hilda I good with it.	2015-08-02

I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I'm 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It's generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.<br /><br />Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin.<br /><br />This serum is great, and I've noticed a drastic improvement in my skin since I started using it, but sometimes it does cause minor irritations like blotching, minor itching and a little dryness. I only use it at night because of this and I always follow up with the night cream. If you have sensitive skin like I do, I do not recommend using this serum more than once a day.  I can say however, that there is a noticeable difference in my skins condition and appearance and I feel I look healthier than I ever have.<br /><br />I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I've never felt better about my own face and it's because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.<br /><br />There's something about this line that just works for me and I'm so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it's a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it's completely worth it.	2015-08-02

LARGE Size Facial Moisturizer For Youthful Radiant Skin | Enriched with Green Tea, Vitamin E & B5	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Works well with noticeable reduction in fine lines	Who ever said getting old was the &#34; GOLDEN YEARS&#34; just lied to us to make us feel better about the inevitable. You get dry skin, wrinkles, loss of tissue volume around the mouth and eyes, and loss of elasticity in the skin. I'm way too young for that however it is a reality.<br />I had the opportunity to try Ove's &#34;Beauty Anti-Aging Face Cream&#34; and I immediately recognized a change. The cream glides on your skin and feels light, refreshing, that does not leave a greasy feeling. It absorbs quickly and a small bit goes a long way. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn't burn, itch, or cause any redness on my face. The results are quite noticeable and from the first use I could feel my skin was softer and had more moisture. Since I use this every day I have seen a reduction in wrinkles. I received a discount on this product in exchange I am giving my honest feedback of this product. You won't be disappointed!	2015-08-02

I was given the opportunity to purchase the Iris in Paris Professional False Eyelashes set at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review so I took it.  The eyelash set is made of plastic and has a bit of sheen to it.  Looking at the lashes there is a distinct pattern as to how they were manufactured; two long lashes followed by about seven shorter lashes then two long lashes then about seven short.  That pattern continues for the entire lash.  I would have preferred a more random look to the lashes.  To apply the lashes you will need to peel them off the plastic based.  The application glue is included in the set and glue is applied to the back brim of the lashes using the wand included in the glue.  The glue should set for about 30 seconds and start to get tacky before you try to apply the lashes.  I had an incredibly difficult time getting the lashes to adhere to my eyelids.  The glue went from wet to dry and never really got tacky.  I was able to get the middle to stay attached; however both ends wouldn’t stay on.  For as well as I was able to wear them they felt good, I could tell they were there, but they weren’t bothering me. Outside of my application issues, which very well could be user error, I like the lashes.	2015-08-02

(Blend of: Lemon, Clove Bud, Cinnamon Bark, Eucalyptus, and Rosemary)	Beauty	4	0	0	N	Y	Smells Great.	I have used many different EO oil companies. This was my first time trying Plant Therapy. It was recommended to me by my sister in laws. Other companies have a similar blend called &#34;Thieves&#34; or &#34;Four Thieves&#34; which is meant for immunity. The particular blend smelled great. I loved using it in my diffuser. I also put it on the bottom of my feet at night to build immunity. I will say though, while using this product over the duration of the winter months I did get the stomach flu multiple times. I cannot say for sure that this oil is less potent/ effective as other companies, but I can say it has left me skeptical. I will be using a different brand this winter to see if I stay healthier.	2015-08-02

I've been wanting it for months now but had super long curly hair that just wouldn't work with this. I recently cut my hair to a way shorter more trendy style and immediately went to the store to get this product. When I got home I curled my hair a &#34;generously&#34; applied this stuff as the bottle recommends. My hair looked great! But there are a couple cons that make me never want this product again: makes your hair utterly dry if used on dry hair (which the bottle says you can but didn't include the fact that it would suck every drop of moisture out of your locks) and it smells like play dough. A lot of people say this smells like &#34; the beach &#34; but not to me, if you have a sensitive nose then I recommend to go for a different product. This will leave your hair smelling like new can of play dough for at least an hour. From what I've read, this stuff works better on straight thin hair, so curly thick haired people, this isn't for you!	2015-08-02

When I first put it on, it was the goopy gel feeling that I knew and hated. I have to say that once it dried, you didn't feel any unpleasant wetness like most gel deodorants. As usual though, the product is a mess when applying - pushing gel through those tiny holes always end up with deodorant all over the place. It would be a much better product if it was dispensed as a gel solid, like Axe deodorant. The first say I wore  Secret Outlast® Clear Gel, it did a pretty good job of keeping me dry (even in 90 degree heat). That being said, it does not offer 48 hour protection like the advertising boasts (not that I think any deodorant really can) because I was a sweaty Betty by the next morning. Also, it still left white streaks on my shirt so I will not be converting in the future.	2015-08-02

I don't know about that but I use this for my hair and skin and it smells great and not perfume-y.

I took this with me on vacation because it has many eyeshadow colors and nice cheek colors that are blendable.  With the right eyeshadow base/primer, the product stays on pretty much all day, even in the hot sun in Aruba.  The only negative I would say is, it only comes with one applicator.  This was easily remedied by purchasing a travel set of cosmetic brushes.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and the price.  Works good for brown and blue eyes.  Arrived on time and packaging was great.	2015-08-02

Once I discovered it, I can't live without it!  I have good but dry skin, and exfoliating with this gel on my face, chin and neck about once a week keeps me youthful and keeps the wrinkles away!  My skin feels so smooth and clean after using, and looks natural and flawless after I apply some moisturizer and Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation (which is a very light foundation).  Warning...you will be tempted but do not use it too often, or you will see flakes on your skin, and your skin may get more sensitive.  It is meant for maintainence only by getting rid of the top layer of dead skin.  Buy on Amazon and don't buy at the mall booths....way overpriced there.	2015-08-02

So I bought this and  Forest.  I don't necessarily like the smell of this one because, it's not bad... but it's not good either.  I only really use this specific one when I've used up Forest and am waiting on more in the mail.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm not necessarily a fan of the smell that I will smell it all throughout the entire day.  Something I've noticed however, is that the scent fades over time from the first application. So the first time you use this it will have a strong smell and about halfway through the tube it's a lot more faint but still detectable.  I'm not sure if I'm the only one that's had that though.  Forest - I love this smell so much, I'm on my second tube of deodorant.  To me it smells like pine or cedar, very strong initially then tapers off as time goes on.	2015-08-02

I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I'm 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It's generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.<br /><br />Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin.<br /><br />This toner has been great in balancing out my skins blotches and discolorations and works as a great prep for makeup application in the morning. It also feels just so refreshing to apply after cleansing too. It doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or stripped either which is a bonus.<br /><br />I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I've never felt better about my own face and it's because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.<br /><br />There's something about this line that just works for me and I'm so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it's a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it's completely worth it.	2015-08-02

Dior is always luxurious and never disappointing, but then I'm personally a Dior/Chanel/Burberry girl. I have sensitive skin and my lips get dry easily, so I can never use drugstore make-up. This lipstick doesn't cause any irritation or drying, I apply a lip balm over it, but it's not necessary as this is slightly moisturizing. The lipstick has a mild scent, it's not offensive, but it's not scent-free. Color is very natural and great for a casual-I'm-not-really-wearing-make-up look.<br /><br />I received it in a pouch, not a box. The product is nice, but I'm a little surprised that the lipstick case looks scuffed up. The lipstick tube itself looks new and unused, but there are noticeable blemishes on the box including a crack on the front and a dent on the side and general scratches. This is how my lipstick should look after rolling around in my makeup bag for several months, which is a little disappointing - part of the Dior allure is the luxe feel of a brand new item. This is not a tester. Bottom line, if you wanted this lipstick for less than Dior ($5 less) get this, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this at a discount for my honest review. For the discounted price, it was worth it and I would buy it again. At full price, probably not.	2015-08-02

I bought this to be used as a face wash for my entire family ages 11, 15, 18 & 36. Within 2 days I noticed a significant difference in my teenager's skin. We have incredibly sensitive skin yet none of us had any type of reaction to this soap. My skin feels soft & clean after using, never dry or tight & although it says exfoliating in the description there isn't an actual exfoliating feel, nothing gritty or course. We use about a dime size amount and that's plenty so this should last a long time.	2015-08-02

Cons: Simply does not work well with the attachments!  Using #1 attachment, it hardly trimmed the hair at all! So unless you only want to use it to without an attachment this isn't going to work! The other major issue I have it that it is is too small! Takes way too long to trim my beard before shaving. Going to go back to using my reguar Wahl hair clippers for my face and body! And finally as everyone else has mentioned, it is super LOUD! Seriously, this will could wake up a hibernating bear! Holy guacamole. Ended up returning. As a sidenote, the Wahl personal groomer than comes as a bonus with some Wahl hair clippers works much  better than this. Happy grooming!	2015-08-02

OK, right off the bat some of you will say, &#34;You can't review packaging in a product review!&#34;.  I call, wrong.  If a product appears to be badly inspected or shipped from the factory, I'm calling it out.  That is the case here.  I find no fault with the product at all.  The shower gel was very nice, nicely scented and as far as shower gels go, did not leave a slimy feeling film on me like some do.  The antiperspirant works as advertised and has a pretty good odor.  The Axe body spray smells nice, as  you would expect it to, being Axe.  My gripe is that the shower gel popped it's cap and leaked everywhere during shipping.  I have had many of these type products shipped to me and this is the only one that has done that.  They may need to put a tab or something on their product to prevent this.  Otherwise, I recommend this kit to those who like the Axe product line.	2015-08-02

Beauty	5	5	5	N	N	Frankly, I would pay more!	Before I purchased this mascara, I checked it out with my eye surgeon - I have chronic dry eye syndrome and chronic Iritis, an inflammation of the iris. She doesn't advise daily eye makeup for me, but after I gave her the specs on this product ( mineral formula, vegan and non waterproof ) she gave me the go-ahead for occasional use. Yipee! Special occasions just became more special! The product packaging is beautiful, and looks like a very high end, very expensive department store mascara. It applies very smoothly, with no clumping or flaking. The color is very black, which I love, and really makes even the tiniest lashes really pop. I experienced zero irritation with this mascara, and it washed off easily and cleanly with mild soap and water. Several reviewers thought that it was a little expensive, but I thought it was well priced. Frankly, I would pay more just for the ability to wear mascara again! I purchased this awesome mascara at a discounted price for an honest review.	2015-08-02

My daughter loves the lip gloss, which is shiny and smells great.  The nail polish is not very durable and easily chips and peels.  The nail file is good sized and works as expected.  I bought this in store for $2.99 on clearance and was hoping to find another set to give to my niece.  I would have been angry if I purchased for the Amazon asking price of $14, which is well over even the suggested retail price.  Nothing makes me more disgusted than sellers who buy up clearance items and then try and gouge unsuspecting consumers on Amazon and eBay.	2015-08-02

I did not expect this to be a professional gun and had little hopes for it. That being said I DID rate it 4 stars. Mainly because this was the best option I found on Amazon. I generally recommend it.<br /><br />Problems: First, don't use the inks. I bought two six ounce bottles of GOOD ink for 14 bucks, they're worth the invest if you hope the tattoos you're giving are any good. Second, there are no instructions as to how you should go about setting up the gun. I'm pretty sure most of these parts are unnecessary, or extra, and I have no idea what to do with all these damn rubber bands. I suppose I'll figure it out when the thing starts falling apart. There's also no return address, which I find particularly shady. And there are only 5 needles.<br /><br />Despite all the issues, it came within three days of me ordering it, and I'm still waiting on the ink. If anyone knows how to put this thing together, please contact me.	2015-08-02

I have tried many different shampoos on her scalp to help relieve her itching and stop the flaking and nothing really seems to do much. I went into trying this shampoo with a bit of skepticism because of the lackluster results I have received from other products claiming to help eczema. This is a bit thicker than other shampoos which is great because you have less of a chance of spilling it and wasting it while trying to get it from your hands to your head,it has a light fragrance but nothing heavy at all. I brushed my daughters hair out after using it the first time and was very happy to see less flakiness,after each time using it,her hair and scalp are looking a little better,I only put 4 stars because I will be using this for awhile and once we are finished with it,I will rectify my review as needed. I received this item at a discounter price in exchange for my honest opinion and review.	2015-08-02

Usually I am thrilled with the items I purchase on Amazon.com but this time is a total bust!  I was pleasantly surprised when the curling iron had a 1.25 inch barrel as that is perfect for my hairdo.  I was also thrilled the first time I used this device as it curled beautifully and quickly.<br /><br />I have been disgusted ever since.  First of all, the device came with no warranty and no English instructions.  Everything is written in an Asian language which I cannot understand.  Secondly, after using the curling iron for almost a week, it suddenly did not work.  It would not heat at all.  I tried it in nearly every outlet in out house to no avail.

I now know what the fuss is about.  This strengthens your hair and gives it shine. I still need a leave in conditioner to moisturize my hair after using this conditioner. It is not the case with other products like deva curl. This is not an issue but I have 4A/4B hair that does not like too much product so I sometimes skip leave ins. However, I give this 5 stars for its hair strengthening , shine and scent powers. I use this once or twice a month or right before getting a protective style. Very good product for weak and fragile hair.	2015-08-02

The irony of this for me is I was super excited to try this product.  I received a coupon so I was getting it at a reduced rate and was excited to try a  '50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid' product, it has been awhile since I used anything with  HA and I thought it was going to be a nice addition to the glycolic acid and rosehip oil face treatments I'm currently using to lessen the brown spots/melasma. My review will not be favorable but it will be truthful.<br /><br />This product smells terrible.  I know smells are subjective but I do see other reviews of this product that mention the smell and all I can say is they are understating the problem.<br /><br />NOTE: the packaging for this container is pretty 'home kitchen' looking.  They use a clear back plastic label on the bottle that isn't centered evenly on the bottle and the plain white box for the product  also has a clear/black printed sticker for identification.  This product is just not very professional and the texture of the product, while it does have a gel-like that is to be expected of HA, it is also watery at the same time and slides right off the back of your hand.<br /><br />I do like the design of the container and I didn't feel any adverse skin issues after the 3 times that I did use it so I'm giving it 2 stars but the smell is enough to keep me from using it again so if it does perform well, I'll never know.	2015-08-02

This was purchased to use on my neck/chest and arms.  I tend to use different types of creams and lotions because my skin is different all over.<br />I received this at a reduced rate with coupon but my review in no way reflects that I purchased this at a sale price.<br />This is a generous 8 oz container. The cream is smooth and sinks easily into the skin with relative ease, no heavy buffing in.  I use rosehip oil on my hands because they are drier, the oil is too oily for my arms/chest/neck but this cream is perfect for arms/elbows and the main use for me which is the d&eacute;colletage area. This cream sinks into the skin nicely, has no heavy fragrances that I've noticed, moisturizes nicely without leaving a greasy feeling.<br />Using this after a shower gives me optimal moisturizing.	2015-08-02

Let me start this review by saying that I'm very picky about toothpaste.  For some reason, most brands of toothpaste give me a sore throat when I lay down after brushing my teeth.

It may look like a regular, boring manual toothbrush. It's so much more than that, though! The bristles are completely different from standard toothbrushes. They're much, much softer and very densely packed. It feels almost like a buffer, making it much more comfortable and safer to brush a little harder and to brush your gums. The slightly curved handle and shorter head also make it easier to maneuver all around your very back molars. Each toothbrush also comes with a clear cap. My teeth feel much cleaner all day long, even compared to using a $100+ Sonicare!	2015-08-02

Well, I was expecting more since there were so many great reviews, but I'm disappointed. I realize they were under $10, and I guess for that price they are good brushes, but I found them way to stiff and difficult for blending. There was some shedding, but my biggest problem was with random long strands that need to be cut/trimmed. It made application weird with longer strands, especially with the first 2 brushes. Just not what I was hoping for. For the price I guess they are decent, though. I have since bought another set of brushes from Amazon that I am more than happy with, though.	2015-08-02

My first No No worked beatifully on my legs and upper lip. It took just a few weeks to stop hair growth for several months, but when I returned to use my No No had stopped working.  I bought a second one that never worked after a few weeks and never removed hair as well as the first.  So I resumed use of a depilatory for a year before ordering yet a third No No hoping the issues had been resolved.  To say I was disappointed is all that is necessary<br />The product is VERY inconsistent and unreliable --even after a recharge. If you are lucky enough to get one that works, you will have great results but will be disappointed when it no longer works when hair .  eventually returns.

I am beyond happy with this product! I recently lost a very close friend and the stress and shock of it has caused my hair to break and fall out. I have fine and thin hair to begin with. So I was desperate to find something that would help. I have been using this for about a week now, and I couldn't be happier! My hair is like silk. And I have noticed a lot less hair in the drain and brush. That means more hair on my head, yay!<br /><br />This product is very creamy, and a little goes a long way. Which is great considering the price. But this product has saved my hair, making it's value way higher then what I paid. I will definitely be using this product from now on. Not to mention, this is one of the best prices I have found for this shampoo. I also saw a couple of reviews saying that this isn't the real product. As soon as I got it (and the conditioner) I took it to my stylist. She has used the product many, many times. She is very familiar with what it's supposed to look like, smell like, and feel like. She confirmed that this and the conditioner I bought ( Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti-Usure Conditioner, 6.8 oz Sold by: Beauty Aid Essentials) were the genuine product. I believe this seller is trust worthy, and I will continue to get these products from them! Thanks so much! :)	2015-08-02

Imagine you order a gallon of whole milk in a glass bottle, but you receive 3/4 of a gallon of fat-free milk in a plastic container. This is exactly how this listing works - it's more of a lottery. When I ordered this item, the image on the listing was of the new formula (twisting metal lid with brown label) but I received the old formula in a black plastic container. The ingredients are different between the two. Why does Amazon allow selling two technically different items on the same listing??	2015-08-02

Six months ago I reviewed the Virilem Fingernail clipper, and I couldn’t hide my enthusiasm:<br /><br />“Nail clippers? Really? My immediate reaction when approached to review this product was a huh-moment. One would be hard pressed to find a junk drawer in America that doesn’t hold at least one dime store nail clipper. So I didn’t think there was anything a manufacturer could do to improve upon something so basic in male grooming. Wrong! These aren’t the same cute little chrome clippers; they’re turbo-charged. I’m talking strong, durable stainless steel, and precision sharp at the business end.<br /><br />As a single guy, a million years ago, I learned that first impressions go a long way when meeting women. They are very detail oriented, and a man’s fingernails are a visual calling card that can be more impressive than a platinum bankcard. Virilem Nail Clippers are well made and very sharp - sharp enough to also do a great job on toenails. But clear the room, because those thick toenail clippings can be semi-dangerous projected missiles.<br /><br />While this device looks like most other nail clippers, once you hold it in your hand, the difference is clear. It has the feel of a real tool. Virilem has designed and manufactured a high quality clipper that precisely cuts nails. But there’s more! The rounded edge of the clipper’s lever is perfect for pushing back cuticles to facilitate uniform nail growth. So it’s a complete nail grooming station in one little device. A lifetime or 30-day money back guarantee tells me that Virilem Nail Clippers For Men has set a new gold standard for the well-groomed male.”<br /><br />Virilem has done it again! With the packaging a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper, Virilem now offers a complete nail grooming solution. There are growing concerns about the sanitary conditions of some local nail salons. So I opted to do my own nails. This quality set simplifies the task for trimming both my fingernails and toenails. Highly recommended! A sample product was provided for this unbiased review.toenails. Highly recommended! A sample product was provided for this unbiased review.	2015-08-02

I'm not sure about lightening but they make your skin glow and clearer. For someone like me who deals with adult acne I was surprised that my face has never been clearer.

I have very fair skin and this color is perfect for wintertime when I have no tan. It helps me cover up freckles and possible rosacea on my lower left cheek. This foundation doesn't get cakey and thick but it also stays on all day without an issue. I like that it doesn't make me look washed out either. I am very fair-skinned in the winter but this foundation still allows a rosy glow. And I love BareMinerals because I have sensitive skin and it never irritates me. I can also sleep in this and it doesn't cause a lot of blemishes or anything like most makeup.	2015-08-02

I have also seen some growth length wise and my hair does look heather.  Progress is slow but steady, I will continue using.

I have to admit I didn't have high expectations.  If you're looking for a miracle wrinkle buster, this is not it.  However, I've been using this on my face, neck, and chest for about two weeks and I'm seeing positive change!  I'm very fair and subject to autoimmune rashes on my face.  Also, I have a very pronounced T-Zone where my face is oily on/around my nose, up and across my forehead, but dry everywhere else.<br /><br />My skin is smoother and this serum is evening out my skin tone.  My face is definitely firmer. My T-Zone is noticeably less oily and my dry zone is noticeably less dry.  I love that I can rub it on my eyelids and it doesn't sting or otherwise affect my eyes, which are very sensitive. It will take a long time for me to know for sure if this protects me from the environmental impacts that age our skin.  However, I like it enough that I plan to keep using it.<br /><br />I suggest you Google Hyaluronic Acid and read about it's uses. Apparently it is medically a good and positive substance, and I couldn't find any negative side affects. There is interesting information out there.  It is used in eye surgery and to treat arthritis among other things.<br /><br />Please let me know if you found this review helpful.  Please ask if you have questions.  Thanks!	2015-08-02

Fantastic Customer Service!	Update of my update 8-28-15: I contacted the seller directly about the light malfunction (and possible manufacturing issue) mine was having and received a swift response, apology of the issue, thanked me for my detailed pictures and would like to send me a replacement at no charge!   I just received it today and cant wait to put it to use!  Update 8-18-2015: Sadly I must decrease my rating in half as my mirror light has already met its demise.  First it just wouldn't light at all, then they stayed on constantly at about 1/10 power.  Thinking that possibly it had been accidentally left on all day, I changed out the batteries with no change.  Then I noticed the entire window housing the led's was full of water.  Upon taking a closer look I see that the portion of the housing for this light assembly that faces up was not sealed at all but the bottom side that water could have attempted to get out was sealed up tight.  Perhaps mine was a manufacturing defect?  The batteries seem sealed up very well....  For me, this light feature is worth half the value to me and without it, this is just another fog free mirror and definitely not worthy of the listed price.  Original Review: For years now I have been shaving in the shower.  It's better for your skin and mitigates the issue of nicks.  I shave my whole head several times a week so that's a whole lot of shave time going on.  I have gone through a few other types of shower mirrors in the past.  I always end up having to use fog-x, soap or routinely rinse it to keep it from fogging up on me.  This mirror solves that issue by the refillable reservoir that keeps it at the temperature of the water hence no fog.  I also like to keep just a low light on while showering but sometimes miss a patch or two and have to touch up areas after my shower.  The added led lighting is a great addition.  They touch sensor switch worked very well whether my hands were dry, wet, or even had shaving cream on them.  Just don't look down into the lights as they are pretty bright.  It would be nice if there were 2-3 levels of lights but they do work well.  I do like that it comes with 3 ways to attach it included.  The included squeegee is a nice addition (also with the built in storage for it). It would be nice at the standard price point for them to include the required batteries.  I have agreed to write this review in exchange for a discounted product.  This has not influenced my review or rating in any way.  So far this is a great product!	2015-08-02

I've used natural sponges off and on for years. &#34;Off and On&#34; because finding them at a reasonable price has been difficult. This product is the best sponge I have ever used and the price for the size is good. We use them instead of wash cloths on faces and bodies. After use, our sponges sit on little stainless steel risers (sold as a soap stand from another source), so they dry quickly and stay clean. Our grandchildren think they are fun to use, our house guests get their own to take home with them, and our family knows their own by its unique shape. These last a long time, have a soft feel, and it is one less item that goes into the washer and dryer--plus everyone keeps up with their own sponge instead of going through a stack of wash cloths in a week.	2015-08-02

Absolutely LOVE this cream!  Really one of the best out there, and I always have a jar on hand.  I love the fact is is a natural product without animal testing too.  I live in California where it is often dry, and if I see my skin is getting overly dry, I apply before bed to give it a boost of moisture and vitamin E.  Not only do I use it on my face, it works great for my feet, heels, hands and any body part that needs extra moisture.  When I use it on my face overnight, I wake up and my skin is so soft and smooth in the morning.  All I have to do is rinse my face with water.  Great product and reasonably priced.  Reason I only use at night is because it is a very thick consistency.	2015-08-02

I left it on for about 8 minutes and it toned most of the ugly golden tones out of my color treated blond hair.  It's a very dark purple so it's a bit off-putting at first.  But it spreads easily through the hair and I was able to work up a nice lather.  It also left my hair clean, which isn't always the case with toning shampoos.  And it didn't leave my hair dry and tangled, although I did follow it with a Pureology conditioner (really good btw) that is very hydrating.  I think I probably could have left it on for a longer period of time, but I was hesitant because this was the first time I'd used it and you can never tell how strong a toning shampoo will be.  It also smells really nice, more floral than chemical.  The next time I use it, I think I'll leave it on a bit longer.  I'm hoping that it will last through a regular shampooing so I won't have to use it every time.  If it does, I'll update this review to five stars!  It was a good buy and I think it's priced pretty fairly.  It was much cheaper on Amazon than it was at Ulta.  I'm tempted to purchase the Joico purple conditioner too.  Maybe they'll work even better together!  All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase and definitely recommend this shampoo for anyone struggling with unwanted golden tones in blond hair.  It worked really well for me.<br /><br />Update:  The effects of this shampoo do not last through a regular shampoo.  I quite like my regular products (Pureology Perfect 4 Platinum and Living Proof Perfect Hair Day) and the way they make my hair look and feel healthy.  So rather than use this shampoo every time, I decided to try using a violet demi permanent toner.  Redken Shades EQ is awesome and the shade 9V worked perfectly.  It toned all of the ugly golden tones out of my hair, doing no damage and leaving my hair soft and glossy.  I left it in for 5 minutes and it lasts about 15-20 shampoos.  This is a much better solution for me than using a toning shampoo every time I wash my hair.  I can use my regular products (which are sulfate free and therefore color safe) which is a very good thing.  Using this toner was a very good decision and although I'll keep Color Endure on hand, I really don't need it very often.  In fact, I only use it when I'm due for a refresh of the toner and simply haven't had time to get to do it.  If you're tired of having to use this shampoo every time you wash your hair, then consider trying Shades EQ.  It was a great decision for me.I wash my hair.

I initially ordered the 2oz pet cream to see if it would help my Dyshidrotic excema. I have had the skin condition, caused by stress, off and on for years. I tried every cream, balm, lotion and potion on the market without success. Doctors suggest steroids, which i did not want to do. There had to be another way. ResQ came to my rescue!  After my initial small jar I ordered the 8 oz. and have had continued healing. My hands are now almost back to normal, no swelling, no itching and no flaking dead skin that comes off taking the first layer of good skin with it. This is a very painful condition with lots of blisters that just cause itching, swelling and then more blisters and raw skin.  Thanks to ResQ, I finally have a partner in the fight!  i would recommend this to anyone with skin issues, and it is a miracle worker on pet skin issues as well. Hope has helped so many rescues and pets with this wonderful cream. If you are considering this cream, go for it! You will not regret the purchase.	2015-08-02

The laser on the trimmer has some value other than just being a freaking laser, yes it does move with the trimmer, but you can use it verify that you have straight lines.<br /><br />I like the fact that the plastic guard is set in a fixed position depending on what setting you choose on the led display, as opposed to my old beard trimmer which had only a few settings, and was not fixed, which usually led to a disaster.<br /><br />Battery life is ok and the power enough to keep a short beard trimmed without any problems, but it has problems with thicker and more hair, requiring you to rinse the trimmer to keep going with the thicker beard.<br /><br />Overall, I like it. It is comfortable to hold during use,  is 110-220v compatible, so you can take this with you when travelling without any worries.	2015-08-02

It felt very nice going onto my skin and did not feel heavy at all. However after 3-4 days of using this product my skin became very dry and started peeling.  It didn't do anything for my acne... in fact, it probably made it worse. =(	2015-08-02

Between the SPF 45 and 50 reformulation, they changed something.  The 50 does NOT go on the same as the 45 did; it's far too thick and will never rub in properly.  Though you won't get burned, and maybe that's really what matters.  Fortunately I found a bottle of 45 and have been using that even though it's past its expiration, and it still works great!... I don't know what will happen when it runs out, though!  In summary: SPF 50: 3 stars (for lack of user-friendliness). SPF 45: 6 stars (for going above and beyond its expiry date and never getting me burned).	2015-08-02

The liquid itself is creamy and silky; a little goes a long way.  I would describe the &#34;lemon verbena&#34; scent as a very soft citrus/herbal fragrance, perfect for summertime and those who live in very humid climates.

I can't say whether all of the ingredients are all-natural but it is still a great product.<br />5 stars, would definitely purchase again.	2015-08-02

I purchased this full-size bottle after receiving a sample in my Birchbox and loving it. I've been using the liquid now for two weeks, and my skin is noticeably healthier. In fact, it's emboldened me to leave the house without any makeup on whatsoever. I'm 45 years old, and up until about 3 years ago, I looked maybe a decade younger than my age. Then I hit peri-menopause, and everything changed, including my skin. This is the first product that has give me back some of my confidence and has me thinking my skin and face actually look youthful! I have naturally oily skin, so I am only using the liquid, not the cream or the combo (my understanding is that for dry skin, the cream is recommended as well). It moisturizes all day. I use it on my neck, as well, and what a difference! I'm telling you- this is as close to a miracle product as I've found, and I was almost hesitant to write a review because I wanted to keep the secret to myself. But that wouldn't be nice. :) Definitely give this product a try!	2015-08-02

I've only used it twice but am looking forward to it every night. I am still waiting for my complexion to have a more 'dewy and translucent' like it is advertised. Will rate it 5 star when I see more results, so far good product for a decent price. Update: after using it for about 10 days I've noticed my skin to be very radiance and healthy. I love this product. Although it says apply at the end of your skin care routine, I've found that when I do that I get clumps of cream on my face. Instead, now I just apply that after my toner and serum and then let it dry a little and apply my night cream. No more clumps and I wake up with bright skin.	2015-08-02

I had previously used a temporary purple dye which had washed off to a light pink. I was just dying the underside of my hair, not bleaching first. I have no experience dying hair other than the very temporary dye which was my test to see if I could do this myself. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Very pleasant smell<br />My hair felt really soft afterwards<br />The dye was a manageable consistency (not drippy or hard to spread)<br />The African Violet color was not at all what I expected, and I was extremely unhappy with the flat, ashy black I was left with.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a great quality product, but that I bought the wrong color. On the lighter parts of my hair, I can see African Violet would have looked like a nice shade of blue had my hair been blonde or bleached. It just looks awful on darker hair. I would have given a five star rating had the color swatch been a better representation. I was looking for a vibrant bluish purple, and it was not that. In regular lighting at work, people thought I had dyed my hair black :/ I have since had my hair professionally bleached and dyed an awesome shade of purple, and will use Purple Rage to do a touch up when needed. If that goes poorly as well, I will modify my review.<br /><br />* Update * I now routinely use Purple Rage and Hot Pink together to achieve what I was after. It looks as good as the professional job I had done. The colors blend well together and whichever you put on your hair first shows up the strongest, so it's easy to get cool effects like hot pink tips which fade into purple higher up. The colors fade fairly quickly, but using this stuff is so easy and leaves hair so nice and soft that I don't mind doing it monthly. The only thing is, while the Hot Pink fades to a nice, soft blonde on bleached hair, the Purple Rage really goes a dirty shade of greenish-grey. I just go over it with pink when I know I won't be touching it up for a while, that cuts the green out. Also, on my natural hair Hot Pink leaves a really nice, vibrant shine. Purple on my natural hair still just goes dark. African Violet on bleached hair still looks royal blue to me.green out. Also, on my natural hair Hot Pink leaves a really nice, vibrant shine.

This toothbrush is great.  I've tried using it with the app on IOS (iPhone, iPad), Android (tablet & phone).  You need to use an app to change the settings which include timers (more than 1), speed/intensity, and order of functions.  The charging base can be remove from the 4 slot toothbrush holder.  The second button allows changing speeds without having to stop/start the session.<br />I don't always use the app when brushing, but the toothbrush remembers the last 20 sessions.  It then synchronizes the next time the app is used while brushing.<br />The only bad thing is when sharing the brush with someone else or multiple devices with the app.  The programmers did not consider this important.  If multiple people use the brush, their brushing history is combined.  If multiple devices are used during different sessions, the settings on the current device changes the settings for the next usage.  If all the settings are not the same, chaos results.	2015-08-02

I bought a two-pack at Costco (before reading reviews) and was excited to be able to use this in the pool due to its non-toxic, all natural formulation. Zinc oxide is quite affective, but in the end I think what made this product &#34;bad&#34; is its lower concentration of about 9% Z.O. versus 20% of other &#34;better&#34; products out there like Tom's of Maine natural baby sunblock.<br /><br />So the one week I tried using this product, I did not get burned, but I've never burned easily in my life. I'm still susceptible to sunburn but I can go longer in the sun than most people. I swam 30 minutes at a time with my dog and the stuff seemed to stay on my skin. The scent is decent. The consistency is thick, so you can't really rub it on like lotion. It really has to be coated on and it takes some effort to rub into your skin. It did not seem to come off in the water, and my skin was fine after. I also used this to do some yard work, but I was mostly covered up doing so (hat, long sleeves, gloves).<br /><br />So in the end, if you want a natural alternative without oxybenzones and other potentially harmful chemicals, look for other varieties of Zinc Oxide sunblocks--the best zinc oxide sunblocks come in 20% or higher concentrations. Good luck!	2015-08-02

This is the best product I have used so far, and I wish the larger size is in stock! I always put this directly on my face after toner and it does not require any base. It may feel a bit oily immediately after you put it on, but your skin absorbs this product very quickly. This works as an effective sun block as well as a great base. Unlike may products, it does not have any color and it does not mix up with other make ups. So you can put BB cream or foundation after you put this sun block on and you do not need to worry about them mixing up. P.s. Shiseido is a Japanese company and their product are pefect for Asian skins!	2015-08-02

I own this color along with the color infitite petal 080 and this color is my absolute favorite. In the past I used the 10 hour stay lipstains and loved them and I love these two. It feels a little weird at first when the gloss is drying but once the balm is applied it feels like I just have chapstick on. Another plus is that I can kiss my husband without leaving marks on him, which he appreciates. Sometimes it does tend to wear off but I found that it only happens when I apply a light coat of chapstick on my lips before applying the stain, if I skip this step the color lasts longer. So it's my fault when the product doesn't last me all day.It works like a charm if used correctly!<br /><br />This product is so good that I used it one day and then got too lazy to remove my makeup before bed and woke up the next morning with the color still looking great the next morning. I found out that the best way to remove this product from my lips is to use a baby wipe. I look forward to trying out the rest of these colors!	2015-08-02

Comprised primarily of organic aloe, witch hazel, willow bark and tea tree oil the product has a subtle but invigorating scent that holds up for the first 20 minutes and then gracefully disappears into the background.<br /><br />The 2nd to the last ingredient is alcohol but there is no 'sting' or drying out effects even if the formula is applied within seconds of a straight razor shave. The formula comes in a handsome, dark amber plastic spray bottle. A couple of spritzes into your palms and then rubbed into your face makes for a nice post shave treat (product sample provided for review).	2015-08-02

I wasn't sure if this was a hairspray or a styling product.  Turns out, it's a styling product that offers a nice amount of hold.  The fragrance is a little manly but it dissipates pretty quickly so anyone can use it.  My husband's hair is starting to thin out a little so he used too much the first time.  He had to brush it out but then felt like it was holding well.  He likes it as a styling gel.  It contains caffeine, which is supposed to help thicken the hair.  Caffeine will thicken and strengthen hair if it is massaged into the hair follicle so a casual topical application of a product like this will be minimally effective for that purpose unless you get it down to the scalp level.	2015-08-02

I had heard of rosehip oil and always wanted to try,  I had previously bought the Radha Vitamin C Serum and was very pleased, so I decided to jump in to try the Rosehip Oil in my quest to correct my sun damaged skin ...I received my Radha Rosehip Oil in a beautiful blue glass bottle with a separate dropper from the cap, the packaging was very professional and I love the color of the blue bottle.  I started using the oil about 7 days ago and my skin feels softer and smoother...I have also been using the oil on my dry heels, elbows and cuticles.  If you are looking for a natural moisturizer, I give this oil my highest recommendation!	2015-08-02

This is the first product I have used that did not leave my lips dry after 2-3 hours. Instead, my lips remained soft all day. Now I use it every night before I go to sleep and every morning before putting on make ups, and I have noticed that sometimes even if I do not put it on, my lips are still soft.

Does NOT provide volume., but a  little goes a long way....it's very concentrated. The shampoo is part of the Shine Collection and definitely  can say it makes my hair shine . And the negative is insects and bugs follow my hair because of the scent during the summer time. I also read chamomile (which is an ingredient in this shampoo) is supposed to make your hair lighter. Better for Blonde hair I guess.  I have dark brown hair and noticed after several months of use my hair did appear to have a lighter tone.    I tired the pink smooth collection rose scent which did not lather as good. I found it had more moisturizers which made my hair a little flatter and oiler because this.	2015-08-02

Heavy (not plastic).<br />2⃣ Jewels and stones can pop out (not noticeable because there are so many on the crown, but you may see some around on the ground).<br />3⃣ Sizing: Since it's metal you can bend it to fit.<br />4⃣ You WILL need bobby pins to fit this in your hair. There are little eyelets on the end that you thread bobby pins through or tie an elastic thread.<br />5⃣ Excellent price.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don't work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product's performance.<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 Yes, absolutely.	2015-08-02

The thing I like about this one is that there is no coating to wear off. It just doesn't fog up.  It uses the basic principle of physics that fog won't form on a surface warmer than the surrounding air. I thought I would be a pain to have to fill it up with hot water every time I wanted to use it, but it just takes a few seconds. I have only had it a few weeks, so I don't know how durable it will be.	2015-08-02

We live in Texas where the sun beams down hotter than it does in Michigan, where we used to live. So a good sunscreen is a MUST HAVE. I'm a little sad that Banana Boat has stopped making their Ultra Defense MAX Sheer Protect in the lotion version. I've found it for sale, but people are charging just under $20.00 and up for the SPF 30 in the 8 oz. size. I use too much sunscreen everyday to pay such an exorbitant price. When I could find it locally, I was paying around the same price for the SPF 100 lotion that I paid for this product. My dermatologist told me that a good sunscreen is necessary when you use Retin-A that works to prevent aging like I do. I did my research thoroughly and it appears that the ingredients in this product are the exact same ingredients in their Ultra Defense. So I've been using Kids MAX for close to a month now and I can safely that this product is terrific, just like the Ultra Defense MAX. It really blocks out the sun well!	2015-08-02

I had been looking for a gel to replace the much less expensive gel I used for many, many years.  The former gel did the job but.....the flakes were out of control. I was never really sure, if the flakes were dandruff or the gel. As it turned out, the old gel caused most or all of the flakes.  I do not notice any flakes now. I was a little surprised initially by the strong smell (strong compared to the old gel) and was ready to stop using it but the intensity of the smell went away when it dried. I like the smell now.  This gel also seems to last longer and control the hair better. After sleeping on it, my hair still looks good. I have not used it very long but my hair also seems to look healthier.  I have one regret: not buying this product years ago	2015-08-02

It is affordable, and I've been using on my skin so far, but plan on using on my cuticles, hair, etc. My skin feels softer already and that fact encourages me to keep using it. I ordered two extra bottles to keep upstairs and downstairs so I can use after washing my hands, face, etc.  I'm impressed with the company also - they communicate to be sure you are liking the product, send tips on how to use, and respond to inquiries very quickly/ I'm so glad I found these folks; I've been wanting to try Argan oil, have tried some samples from a different company, but the other company I tried was SO EXPENSIVE that I didn't want to even get started on something I couldn't afford.  Aria Starr Beauty IS affordable, and it's 100% pure Argan oil. That works for me!  THANK YOU Aria Starr for making this possible!<br /><br />Update in 2016 -<br />5 Stars - &#34;Love this stuff. This is the 4th bottle I've purchased--appreciate the reasonable price & this company is great to work with. The argan oil soaks into my skin, does NOT make it greasy, and it lasts forever it seems like. I will continue using this for a long time to come. Thanks Aria Starr - I appreciate the price, and the ease of working with your company.	2015-08-02

I tried spraying this before swimming, but after 20 minutes it was gone (perhaps washed away in the water).	2015-08-02

This stuff has caused miracles to happen!! I am a type 1 diabetic who has had some sort of acne all of my life i have NEVER been able to find something powerful enough to keep my face hydrated UNTIL NOW!! I have used EVERYTHING on the market + been to a dermatologist all of my life, and when i say I have used EVERYTHING i mean EVERYTHING. All i had to do was find something that was mostly natural and/or organic, I can't believe i NEVER thought of that!!! I have never in my life been able to have a clear, hydrated, and healthy looking face until now, and when i started this 2 weeks ago my face was completely dry and flaky and i had several hormone related acne spots, after ordering DHEA 50mg along with the Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum + the Vitamin C serum by Joy and Karma. My face finally looks BEAUTIFUL, and what's funny is the dryness went away after my first use. I will swear by this stuff until the day i die!! Joy and Karma has now changed my life to the fullest and I'm so excited to be able to go show my new face off!!	2015-08-02

[[VIDEOID:2fd3f128f47ad3fdd27bfb206ca7e764]]This review is for the Swarovski elements crystals heart shape bangle bracelet for women girls.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous and delicate heart bracelet... The bracelet is on the smallish size. I am a larger girl and I was able to get it on. In fact, it comes with an extender chain so I'm pretty sure you could get it on a lot of different sizes, however the metal part that wraps around might start to become REALLY tight on size 16+ females unless you have a very petite wrist.<br /><br />The sparkle and shine on this bracelet is out of this world. The larger accent heart is flanked by several smaller crystal hearts. All the crystals are pure white/clear and beautiful and very luminescent. The silver is plated many times and accents the crystals perfectly.<br /><br />I love this bracelet and get a ton of compliments on it when I wear it. It goes with a ton of different outfits. All jewelry from this company comes in a nice hard white box ready for gift giving. The box is padded inside and sometimes comes with a jewelry cleaning cloth. I also received a free scarf with my order which I LOVE! 5/5 stars for femininity, delicateness and sparkle!<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

I bought this as an engagement ring for my fiance, he loved it. However, if you work in any sort of manual labor or if your fingers fluctuate ring size often and this thing gets bent too mamy times (its sterling silver it doesnt take much) it will break. I am really upset that it broke. But it is sterling silver, its not the strongest metal.	2015-08-02

Now I won't have the correct ring in time for next weekends' special occasion! WOW talk about SUPERLATIVE customer service!!!. I had been disappointed with the Keshi ring pictured here BUT The Pearl Source not only returned my cost but worked closely with me in creating the ring I need for my big family event,.I received the new ring in two days!! This ring is STUNNING. The Beautiful pink pearl is gorgeous and very handsome. The sterling silver is bright and the little CZs crisscrossing around the pearl is very feminine. The perfect PINK pearl exactly matches all my other pink pearl jewelry. I am so very happy with it that I can barely stand to take it off. I look forward to continuing to shop with The Pearl Source..

Bling is not my thing. I do, however, love Celtic knot work and similar designs.I work as a teacher in high school and prefer to have a professional appearance whenever possible which tends to include jewelry. This is a style I like because of how simple it is, but it still reflects my own tastes. Okay, down to the nitty-gritty:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Simple, classic design goes with everyday clothes or professional style.<br />2. Brushed silver look works well with most/all skin types as well as most clothing colors.<br />3. Charm (?) is about the size of a quarter with the top branches just brushing beyond that diameter.<br />4. Not heavy, but thick enough to avoid getting bent easily.<br />5. The metal used will get a patina if you wear it a lot, but that will just give it that great weathered look.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The chain is tiny.  I know if you read the specifics, you will know this. The length makes it sit just a bit below the hollow of your throat.<br />2. The closure latch is TINY.  I hate putting on necklaces because of the tiny ring that you have to open and hook and this one is particularly small for my nail-less (anxiety, thy name is education) fingers.<br /><br />So, the only cons have to do with the chain which, to me, is not enough to lower the rating because it can easily be replaced.  The charm (not even sure that's what you call it?) is the star of this piece and is amazing and beautiful. I added the chain information because if you have no desire to fuss with a small chain or latch, this might not be what you are looking for, though it means very little to me, personally.<br /><br />I love, love, love the simple beauty of this necklace and will wear it often.  Now, I need earrings to go with it....	2015-08-02

This is the second product I've received from Three Keys and I have to say I am still completely satisfied. This leather band is the most simple of the products I've purchased, and its definitely the most comfortable. It's leather with a magnetic steel clasp so you know it is durable. Its the perfect size to fit around the average persons wrist and allows wiggle room without falling off your hand during movement. Its simple design allows  the bracelet to be worn with anything and its comfortable enough to wear all the time, even to bed or just lounging without being noticed. I am definitely glad to have purchased this bracelet and its a welcome addition to my wardrobe and accessories. I did purchase this at a discount in exchange for my review, but its definitely at an affordable price as of the time of this review. I definitely recommend  Three Keys Jewelry products to any guy looking to boost their wardrobe or any person looking to buy a gift for their guy.	2015-08-02

I intend to wear them often.<br />Like others, we found the clasp difficult and impossible for me. We are taking them to our locally owned fine jewelry store to have it replaced.<br /><br />My dear husband was very dissapointed in the box, as were others here. But then, I have a beautiful heirloom jewelry box to keep them in. When they're not draped around my neck!<br /><br />The earrings were a nice extra too.<br /><br />*My husband, over our years together has ticked off each item. Quality diamonds,  natural emerald, ruby, safires, (necklace, earrings, rings). These complete this list.<br /><br />The only 'problem' remaining is to decide who will inherit. Nice problem, yes?	2015-08-02

Mine also arrived with the top and bottom house upside down. Maybe there was a purpose for this, but I took mine apart, arranged the houses in alpha order, and I really like it now! Overall, I'd say a great piece for occasional wear and an awesome price! I didn't mind doing the adjustments either. It is really pretty!	2015-08-02

I had been eyeing this ring for some time before I decided to purchase it, and I am very glad that I decided to buy it.  The ring is delicate, the stones and pearl small, but the sizes given in the description will give you a clue that you are not getting big emeralds, as should the price.  The setting is sterling silver, the style delicate, with scrolls and intricate design on the sides.  It looks like something you'd see at any of the gift shops in Colonial Williamsburg or that you might see at an antique store or estate sale, if you are lucky enough to be able to find jewelry dating back to the 18th century (it is very rare and very expensive).  I'm happy to own a reproduction.  I have small, skinny fingers, so the small stones and pearl and the delicate setting suit me very well.  It doesn't overwhelm me, nor make me look like a child who raided her mother's jewelry box.  The emeralds are a lovely color--quintessential green with just a hint of blue, and are nicely complimented by the white metal and pearl.  The emeralds are also set in so they don't protrude--nothing to get caught on clothing--they lie flush with the setting.  The pearl too does not protrude so much that you will bang it if you wear it for everyday.<br /><br />I love the scroll work in the setting--elaborate but not fussy and does not overpower the hand.  It is the kind of ring that I can wear to work at the office, out to lunch with friends, out shopping as well as with a much dressier outfit to the opera or to a wedding.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this seller highly enough, either.  There was a slight issue with shipping, and when I contacted the seller via Amazon, the seller was happy to work with me around the shipping requirements.  The ring arrived very quickly, in perfect condition.  The next time I'm in the market for Georgian or colonial American design/style jewelry, I'll check out their items first.  My co-workers thought I lucked out at an estate sale, an antique store, or a flea market, or that I had inherited it from a many times great-grandmother!	2015-08-02

I make my own jewelry so you can imagine how much storage I would need. One of the things I really like about this jewelry organizer is that either way you flip it, its the right side up. This makes it especially convenient for hanging longer necklaces as you can pull the chain down the backside and loop it over one of the bottom hooks.  I managed to fit 60 necklaces of varying sizes on this display and was still able to close it. I recommend putting thin chains on one panel and thick ones on the next and keep sticking to that pattern until the display is full in order to get it to fold up properly.

I might just be bad at knot tying though haha. Anyways, I just superglued the knot together and have been wearing it nonstop ever since. The metal loop between the string and the main piece has turned to brown, probably from me showering with it on, but the main piece has stayed its original color.	2015-08-02

No sparkle and the bracelet kind of turns ...	Quality is adequate/average. It did come ahead of the projected time....I was hoping it would because it was a birthday gift. If you are buyingfor yourself and not concerned with gift presentation, you need to know that seller sends a fairly substantial bracelet in a TINY box that would BARELY fit a small pair of STUD earrings. A tiny 1 3/4 inx 1 3/4in box that was really cheap and crushed on one side. So if you are thinking of getting for a gift be sure you have a decent presentation box. The quality again is average at best. No sparkle and the bracelet kind of turns on itself and doesn't lay flat. It is not worth the price. I am keeping I THINK....it's a gift for my daughter. She loves Mystic Topaz, if she likes it enough then it is what it is....if it was for me, it would be on it's way back to wherever....but we'll see if she likes it. I really wanted to rate as 2..so between 2 and 3 I guess, 3 is a little generous.	2015-08-02

My daughter instantly fell in love with this necklace! Here are our thoughts on it:<br /><br />• Design and appearance: This is an adorable looking necklace. It’s cute, but not necessarily childish. The necklace is sparkly, which my daughter usually doesn’t like, but with this one she loved the way it looks. It could be a great gift for a cat lover, young girl or anyone who likes pink sparkly things.<br />• Quality: All the stones are set well and sparkly. There aren’t any major flaws I can identify. I’ll update that if we lose any stones or have any problems. The pink stone is a beautiful deeper rose pink, which she loved.<br />• Chain: The chain isn’t the heaviest or the most fragile. I can’t stand the super thin, fragile chains nor the thick masculine chains. This is the perfect mix between the two. There’s a short section at the end to adjust it.<br /><br />We have no complaints about this. My daughter loves wearing it and gets a ton of compliments on it. I was sent this to test and review. That has no bearing on the rating or review I gave it, this is my honest opinion.	2015-08-02

I love the look of pierced nipples but not the whole.... everything else so I thought these would be perfect. &#34;Would be perfect&#34; if they fit, but alas, they did not. I didn't think my nipples were on the small size, I guess I should have paid more attention. I even bent the sides of the loop (squished in) and they stayed on... until I moved. So if your nipple is less than the 10 cm wide, I'd pass.	2015-08-02

I wanted to give my daughter something inspirational for her 8th grade grad that she could keep with her as she transitioned from middle to high school.  After debating for weeks about which piece to buy I decided on this one, as I had it on a poster when I was a kid and found the positive message motivational back then.  Imagine my surprise when I was handed a program at the ceremony and this very quote was on the cover!  Must have been meant to be.  Ok, back to the review - The piece arrived just as pictured, with gift box, and it is actually reversible.  The back has a nice curve that catches the light and is very shiny.  My dtr prefers to wear the words facing her heart and the simple shape doesn't &#34;compete&#34; with other jewelry she wears.  She's worn it all summer so I think it's a hit!	2015-08-02

[[VIDEOID:41166cb7f50266b77664b92b956e1b16]]This review is for the Women's Rose Gold Filled Plated Box Chain Pendant Sweater Chain Collar Long Necklace with Brown Austrian SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS.<br /><br />This is a substantial brown crystal necklace on a beautiful intricate chain. The crystal is caged in with a top plate of circles, clear crystals and gold plating. It is absolutely stunning!<br /><br />The jewelry y has a solid weight to it. It is VERY quality. The back of the pendant is styled in a daisy shape. The accents of the clear crystals really bring out the sparkle of the whole piece. The circles are a nice accent to the solid brown crystal. It was designed very well and looks great. The top cage plate comes away separate from the brown crystal.<br /><br />The chain is pretty thick and unique in pattern. It is plated and super shiny like the pendant. The chain is very long. It cannot be shortened. The clasp is solid and quality. This piece of jewelry really makes a statement. It is simply beautiful.

Very very disappointed all of my charm started falling off within a day or two. I was so excited when my charm bracelet Came I have only one or two that are still hanging on.

I love the font of the B that I ordered. They are well made and shine very well. They are quite a bit bigger than I expected. When put on a shirt they look a bit funny and move around. They are much better on a jacket. When locked in place they do not come loose. The locking bar is easy to turn but stays exactly where you put it. I surprised my husband with these for his birthday and he loves them. Adds a little more class to his dress up style.<br />I purchased these at a discounted rate in return for my unbiased review. The above is my honest review of these cuff links.	2015-08-02

After what seemed like forever to untangle the chain and pull multiple kinks out (though obvious effort was made by the manor and sturdy gift box of which it was packed in) I felt a tad let down by lack of weight I thought it should have.  Seems very cheap.  However, that said, it is a fun piece for casual wear.  Not sure it will hold up well.  Over priced for what it actually is.  I will keep it and I do really like the necklace just not quite what I hoped it would be.  The glass seems more like plastic and the back is a textured faux gold so you really could wear it with either side showing.  NOT a must have but it is fun and cute.  Great size and wearability. I almost want to give 4 stars but won't.  For half the price it would be a fab casual find.	2015-08-02

I often only wear two, or just one. This is just a personal preference though, as they look very nice together when you wear all three.<br /><br />The rings are pretty and look more delicate in person than they look in the picture. They are thin and look very dainty when you wear one by itself. They are smaller than I expected from looking at the picture of the rings by themselves. The photo of the rings on a hand give you a better idea of scale. If you want something big and sparkly, this probably won't appeal to you. They are modest and small enough for a younger girl to wear them.<br /><br />I typically wear a size 7 ring on my ring finger, and it fits as expected.	2015-08-02

He also enjoys unique cuff links that are a bit fun and cheeky and I enjoy picking those out for him.  I received this pair of world map cuff links at a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion.  Honestly, with their regular price, I am quite surprised (in the best way) about the quality.  They are a good size and of decent girth giving them the look and feel of something much more expensive.  The blue water is a stunning shade that really stands out and looks lovely.  Since my hubby likes to travel, this was the perfect set of cuff links for him that expresses his love of travel with his love of fun cuff links and other accessories.<br /><br />These are quite nice and would make a lovely gift for that person on your gift list that likes to travel and has to dress up frequently.	2015-08-02

Unfortunately, it was made from cheap metal which would continually stretch beyond its elastic limits and would no longer work to hold smaller stacks of bills unless I bent it back into shape.  When I saw this, the hinged latch seemed  like a great idea to hold the bills in place, so I bought it.  It's a great idea.  It really works great with stacks of bills of various thickness.  It also has a very attractive finish.<br /><br />When I first got it I found it awkward to hold onto the clip with one hand and the bills with the other while trying to open the clip.  Eventually I hit upon a technique of cradling the clip in my right hand while prying it open with my right thumbnail -- it works great and I can handle it very naturally now.<br /><br />If you're new to money clips, here's a tip.  A lot of people like to fold the bills in half before putting them in the money clip.  The problem with that is, unless one is wanting to remove the bills on the outside, one has to unfold the stack which means finding the halfway point (that is, the surface of the bill on top) which can be awkward and tricky and even result in dropping bills.  I prefer to fold the bills in thirds which means that the stack opens naturally when removed from the clip.  Even more convenient is putting the clip in the middle of the unfolded stack and then folding it in thirds before putting it in one's pocket.  It's a little messier that way -- loose coins in the same pocket can get caught between the bills (and typically drop out and roll away the minute the stack of bills is opened) but it makes accessing the bills very easy the minute they're out of one's pocket.	2015-08-02

Any coloration is closer to the base and on one you can barely even see it unless you look closer. The fastener for the more faded one even fell out within minutes. Metaphysical properties will be quite lacking with the faded coloration. The glue holding the fastener in is spilled over the top and makes it look cheap. As far as appearance goes though, the shape looks very organic, you can tell it's a real rock for sure. I didn't want to settle for synthetic, but I didn't want this either.	2015-08-02

It still looks as if I'd just purchased it a week ago. No clear or noticeable signs of wear or anything.<br /><br />I decided to review this because I felt that I should address the negative reviews it's gotten.<br />The color - Hasn't fallen off/no chips in the color/etc.<br />The size - It definitely is just under an inch in diameter (literally just measured it as I was typing this out). The other customer must've gotten a defective one or doesn't know how to use a tape measure.<br /><br />I'd recommend this pendant to anyone that asks.	2015-08-02

I got this ring because I have been looking for something like this at a decent price for quite some time. I did get it at a discount to review which is also a plus! I love it! I opened the package and couldn't wait to try it on. It is a thinner ring which I like. I got it to wear as my wedding ring because the ring I did have, the diamond fell out of and to me it just isn't worth or important to have a diamond ring. I like having something that is durable and doesn't cost a lot of money.<br /><br />I also love that this is a hypoallergenic ring because I do have sensitivity to a lot of metals in jewelery. This definitely stays true to that, as I have had no issues with it hurting or causing a reaction at all. I have even gotten the ring wet and never had an issue with it.<br /><br />It is a true black color as well, so no lie when they say it is black.<br /><br />This is a ring I would be more than happy to pay full price for. It is durable, doesn't bother my sensitive skin and looks great. My husband loves it because it matches his ring (Of course I do too), and it was a great price. I also loved that the seller included a hand written note along with the ring and it had my name and ring size written discretely on the package to ensure I got the proper ring size! I love when people pay attention to detail and ensure that there are no problem.	2015-08-02

Each crystal is just under a 1/4&#34; in diameter. There are twelve pairs on this 7 1/4&#34; bracelet with a single one on each end of the clasp.<br /><br />How easy is it to get on? This bracelet is a little tougher than some to get on but I can manage it by myself without assistance. The bracelet is presented in a quality gift box and once opened you will find the bracelet in a sealed plastic bag inside.<br /><br />Mine came with a FREE, very pretty silk-like scarf (approximately 18&#34; x 19&#34;) included in a separate box in the sealed package. The coloring of the scarf is mostly reds and greens on a white background - floral pattern.<br /><br />PLEASE remember this is fashion jewelry. Although silver in color, it is not silver in metal but actually white gold plated alloy. I have to say that I don't like this bracelet as much as some of their others BUT that is my personal opinion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this bracelet and if you like the look of it you can purchase with confidence! (Hence still awarding this bracelet 5 stars and not 4!) Product was received in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Liz	2015-08-02

It looks really good and seems well constructed. It also came in a good quality white box. The crystals look great and are quite sparkly. In the box was also a round mirror and a small microfiber cloth that can be used to keep the necklace shiny & clean.<br /><br />There is some weight to this so it feels &#34;substantial&#34;.<br /><br />There are a lot of &#34;circles&#34; on this necklace so if you want something simpler than you may prefer something else... but otherwise you'll probably be quite happy with this and it would also make for a nice gift.<br /><br />And the most important thing: no complaints from my picky wife (at least not yet!).<br /><br />And you can't beat the complete refund if you're not satisfied.<br /><br />NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.

The enameling on the emblem design is clear and distinct within the silver base (no bleeding of enamel over edges as so often the case in shoddy costume jewelry). The design is clean and sharp and looks like what it is supposed to look like. The posts are sturdy and solid without being too heavy or lightweight and function appropriately as cufflinks. The back piece swivels easily to allow for insertion and securing.<br /><br />If you have someone in your life who is a Trek fan, these make an excellent gift. They arrive triple super well packed with each cufflink in a tiny zippered plastic bag and those two bags inside of a another similar but larger bag. The black gift box is in a sealed pouch which also has a zippered top and all of that is shipped in a padded mailer. If you want to give them as a gift and have the recipient view the mounted links, you'll need to take them out of their respective bags and put them in the included gift box. They are clean, sturdy, nicely designed, and you really couldn't ask for much more, especially at the current price.<br /><br />Note: I was given this product in exchange for my assessment.	2015-08-02

This could be worn by a teenager but, I am an older adult and will proudly wear this around my neck.<br />The pink stones in this makes this so feminine looking and adds just enough pop to make it stand out.	2015-08-02

(if you don't know what it is - you should DEFINETELY check it out!)<br /><br />The pendant looks EXACTLY like the Dubai Eye and is gorgeous and pulls as many colors as the actual ferris wheel does in real life. The crystals are a TON of different colors. It looks like the designer put every color he could find into this piece!<br /><br />The back is enameled BEAUTIFULLY and if you chose - you can flip the pendant around and wear it the other way! The enameling gives it a completely different look but still stays true to the Dubai Eye design.<br /><br />The necklace is gorgeous and pairs with the pendant perfectly. You can take it on or off the chain. The chain is also a great length and the piece as a whole has a nice weight to it and feel. 5/5 stars for color pallet, design and uniqueness.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

This has been my go-to nosering for the last couple of years.  I prefer nose bones because they don't seem so scuzzy on the inside, if you know what I mean.

They also are flashy with metal mesh and a little sparkle. The dark beige metallic look blends nicely with almost any color outfit but looks fantastic with black. While the bracelet and necklace could function easily as evening wear, I was able to wear these two to work and get several well-deserved compliments on them. When tested the two magnets on both bracelet and necklace will open, but only if pulled moderately hard. I liked the slight stretchiness of the necklace and bracelet and would recommend these two for their fashion and functionality. They also would make great gifts! These deserve 4 out of 5 stars.&#34;	2015-08-02

I had been looking quite a while at tungsten rings and this one really caught my eye.  I ordered it because the description said the band was 6mm - but when placed in my cart, it showed 8mm!  Color me confused!  I removed it and started over - same result.  So, I went ahead with the order anyway, because I wanted the ring, but also contacted the seller.  Within 12 hours, I had my answer - it was truly the 6mm band, not 8, and they would find and remedy the problem.  The ring arrived and it's gorgeous!  I love that the turquoise is set slightly below the outer tungsten bands, so it should be fairly well protected.  The comfort fit is great, and overall the size was perfect as well.  I liked it so much and it's of such nice quality, and at such a great price, that my husband also ordered one for himself!<br /><br />I will update if I have any problems with the turquoise inset - others purchasing similar rings have complained about the turquoise cracking/falling out.	2015-08-02

I had an earlier comment (not a review). But since others weigh in with five star reviews I felt compelled. Just because it's 'art' doesn't mean people can't offer negative opinions. And there has never been a better example. I mean this thing is HIDEOUS. Even the gold plating looks awful, not just the griptape top. So in case you're thinking about this as a gift and using opinions as a guide... here's a '+1' for absolutely hiddy. If I got this as a gift I don't think I could be polite- I'd immediately use it to sand off my eyeballs to not suffer another moment looking at this abomination to jewelry.	2015-08-02

The different metals, the fake jewelry, and fake gems versus real gems and everything. It took me a very long time to settle on this ring (so many choices out there!)<br /><br />I finally settled on Tungsten as a metal, an inexpensive and strong metal that's also quite flashy with a high polish.<br /><br />It's day 2, I've purposely banged and scratched it against a few things (I mean it's cheap and I would like to know what I'm paying for), and each time I did so it held up fine. The polish stayed, the inlay didn't scratch (im thinking the whole ring is solid tungsten, which I highly recommend), and the band didn't change colors, react to my finger oils or soap from the shower, or turn my finger colors. It's quite heavy (as tungsten is) but its a great size for someone skinny like me. I got the ring in size 6.5 incase anyone needs to see a visual example of what the ring might look like on me. To be clear though, even 6.5 is too big for me (it only fits on my index finger), so if you have hands like mine and a similar height/weight, go with a size 6.	2015-08-02

The transaction and delivery time was excellent, but the engagement ring has some flaws.

The detail that went into the making of this necklace makes it look way,way more expensive than what it really was.

Now the product has two charms at the end of the cord it comes with,  the moment I touched them they fell off I'm not as annoyed as I normally would be because the company was so kind and completely replaced my necklace with a whole new one after hearing what happened. They didn't even think twice about replacing it which was absolutely wonderful and although the one I originally bought had brought I still got my moneys worth!	2015-08-02

These earrings are quite attractive and big (total approx. 2&#34; long).  I usually wear a smaller earring, but thought these would be fun to wear as a statement earring, when I feel adventurous.  The earrings are a pretty crescent shape with a filigree swirl design of 18K gold plate over Sterling Silver.  The earrings are flat, sides are smooth, and they are lightweight.  There is a small Tiger-eye stone bead above two chains that hold up the crescent on each earring. The closing is the leverback which is much safer than the fishhook.  I have purchased earrings from the Amazon Curated Collection in the past and have been well pleased.  Looking forward to wearing these out to dinner soon.	2015-08-02

I don't really like to wear studs but sometimes dangly earrings just don't look right with an outfit..  I was excited when I came across these because they are kind of a hybrid between studs and dangles.  My ear piercings are right in the middle of my lobe so these look very pretty on and you can't see the wire that holds the larger ball just below my earlobe.  I've gotten a ton of compliments on them and people always ask me to see how they work which I think is kind of funny.  One thing that is important to know is that the bottom portion which is actually the backing for the top stud part of the earrings fits very loosely onto the post.  It comes with little clear plastic stoppers that go on the post after the backing to make them more secure but if you lost those then you wouldn't be able wear the earrings anymore because they wouldn't hold together on their own.<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-02

I added a charm to it and the length is just perfect.  It's very thin and delicate so you need to be careful not to catch it on anything because it would probably break very easily.

I didn't catch it on anything, only putting it on over my head so I'm not sure why it broke.  Like I mentioned above - this chain is very thin & delicate.

It's not over the top bland but it's perfectly simple and doesn't take away from your jewelry.<br /><br />My bracelet stays in place even when the box is moved around, the inserts inside are perfectly placed. I'm not sure how else to describe the inside other than I love how well my bracelet fits in it. I had a different ox that BARELY held it in it's place.<br /><br />I love that it comes with a pouch, it just adds to it's character. The whole box is just perfect.<br /><br />I love that it's made in America, and that this company actually cares about the jewelry boxes they make... How many horrible boxes are on the market? I know I have had a few and that I felt like i had wasted money. Won't happen with this company, and I know because I have a LOT of thier boxes!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.	2015-08-02

Aiyaya`s 1carat Cut Cz Solitaire Bridal Ring it's stylish, it's 18 ct gold plated ring and looks beautiful . Here is the reason why I ordered and do not regret:  We are going camping and last time we went she actually lost her engagement ring and I had to of course replace it. Now she can still look nice wearing this amazing ring and have no worries about loosing the ring because I wont be loosing crazy thousands again. She travels to latin america and its not safe to wear diamonds and gold .So this will be the one for trips since she loves the look, and doesn't have any allergies to the material so far . It's a well made ring and comes with a red velvet bag. I received my ring for free during the product launch promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-02

This bracelet is unique because you wrap it around your wrist twice, and then use the magnetic clasp to close it! It takes SECONDS to put on and holds very securely!<br /><br />The sparkly diamond crystals are all contained in long mesh tubing that holds everything together and around your wrist. The mesh tube does NOT pull the fine hairs on my wrist or cause any type of discomfort. It is very smooth and soft against my skin. There are so many crystals that when the light hits the tubing - it is VERY glittery. I love this bracelet and it looked better in person then on the Amazon page.<br /><br />The magnetic clasp is SO secure. And it takes seconds to put on. Wrap... and snap. So simply any age could operate this bracelet. In fact, that is what makes it really great for a younger person or even an older person whose eyesight is not the best. It is just so easy to put on anyone could do it.<br /><br />5/5 stars for unique design, beautiful crystals and smooth mesh!<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

It is fairly versatile. The black enamel makes it causal - but then the accent of crystal makes it flashy.<br /><br />The piece has some good weight to it, it feels very quality. The pendant hangs nicely on the chain and stays center and flipped the correct way at all times. It can be removed from the chain and put on a different necklace or you can use the chain for something else.<br /><br />The chain is simply beautiful and unique! It is made with gold beading work - not seed beads, but these are gold metal beads. It is SO pretty! It is very fluid and flows around my neckline perfectly. The clasp is secure and easy to operate. The necklace is a good length.<br /><br />Last, the earrings pull together the look perfectly. They match the pendant and create a flash of sparkle near your face too. They are very comfortable and easy to take on and off. 5/5 stars for enameling, materials and design.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-02

The sapphire colored cubic zirconia gems are WAY darker. This bracelet has a delicate look to it with each cluster having the dark blue center gem with a number of clear ones surrounding it. Each of the gems is &#34;clawed&#34; in, set similar to a ring. There are 22 clusters on this 6 7/8&#34; length bracelet with an extra cluster and clasp enclosed for extra length if required. Each cluster is approximately 1/4&#34; in diameter.<br /><br />How easy is it to get on? This bracelet is a little tougher than some to get on but I can manage it by myself without assistance. The bracelet is presented in a quality gift box and once opened you will find the bracelet in a sealed plastic bag inside.<br /><br />Mine came with a FREE, very pretty silk-like scarf (approximately 18&#34; x 19&#34;) included in a separate box in the sealed package. The coloring of the scarf is mostly reds and greens on a white background - floral pattern.<br /><br />PLEASE remember this is fashion jewelry. Although silver/white gold in color, it is actually only white gold plated alloy. If you are looking for something a little different, dainty but with some color then this could well be the bracelet for you! Product was received in exchange for an honest review.

Quite honestly, I had hopes of finding a replacement for a black necklace I had lost. Since I was able to wear my other necklace with casual clothing as well as with more  dressed-up outfits, I had second thoughts about keeping this new one because it is UBER dressy in appearance, and I didnt think I'd want to wear it with a more casual look. However, the more I &#34;studied&#34; it, the more attached I became to it ... and flat out stated that this necklace was NOT going back to the seller! And guess what!?! My sister called me the next day to say that she had found my &#34;lost&#34; necklace in her kitchen!<br /><br />Although the following isn't anything near having to deduct a Star, you might be interested to know that the larger of the beads in this necklace are a LOT smaller than they appear in the picture shown in the ad ... although that doesn't bother me one tiny iota! When you see it in person you'll know exactly what I mean. In fact, you know how &#34;sparkly&#34; can sometimes tend to look inexpensive? Well, in this case, the sparkles are not the bright, blinding kind at all.  Instead, they add a subtle, &#34;twinkling elegance.&#34;<br /><br />Bottom line is that I think you should get this necklace so that:<br />1. You can see it for yourself!<br />2. I can stop talking about it and WEAR it!! lol	2015-08-02

The lotus pendant is the exact same size as the lotus on the post earrings I purchased from the same seller. It is a short chain, so on me the pendant sits about an inch or so below my collarbones. This seems like the right length of chain for a pendant so small. I think it would look great layered with another, longer chain and pendant, but I also like the subtle look of wearing it alone.	2015-08-02

I'm not sure why all the negative reviews. I have worn mine several times and it seems sturdy enough. I've had no problems with it. The moon and galaxy look pretty much as pictured. The only problem I have with it is the pieces tend to turn and move around quite a bit. I think it might hang a bit better if the galaxy part was attached maybe just a bit farther in on the crescent moon, though it would change the angle of the moon a bit. I wasn't expecting high quality jewelry and this is pretty. It goes great with my galaxy shirt. I received this pendant at a promotional price for the purpose of product testing and feedback in the form of an honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I try very hard to write reviews that contain information that I would want to know when considering purchasing a product and that I would find helpful in making a purchasing decision. I believe reviews should be honest regardless of whether an item was received free, at a discount, or purchased at full price.

This is an extremely beautiful rosary and because it is made of stainless steal it has a wonderful masculine weight to it.

The special message on the inner heart makes it a wonderful gift for someone you love.	I gave this to my mom as one of her birthday gifts. She loves it and wears it often. Here are our thoughts on it.<br /><br />• Versatile: It is really simple and elegant. You can wear it with anything, fancy or casual. It has nice quality clear stones around the heart that pick up natural like and make it sparkle nicely.<br />• Heart: The heart inside a heart design is cute. We both noted that the inner and outer hearts always stack together, like two puzzle pieces. We had both thought they would move around when wearing it so the inner heart would pop out and be perpendicular to the outer heart. Like one would be flat against the skin and the other would be sideways if that makes sense. This doesn’t detract from its simple beauty, just something we both thought would be a little neater.<br />• Chain: The chain is very feminine and on the thinner side. I have some other jewelry by the same seller that has chains that are a tiny bit larger that I personally prefer. I just like the more substantial, a little more durable chain, which my mom agrees about.<br />• Quality: This is where all of the jewelry from this seller really shines. I can tell they put a lot of time into coming up with unique, but not odd pieces that all have excellent quality. All of the pieces by them have little touches here and there, like the writing on the inner heart, that show they went above and beyond to make it a little more special. When I look at the jewelry up close I don’t see any obvious imperfections or anything off.<br />Overall, this has been a beautiful gift for my mom. I am marking down one star for the chain and that the hearts stay sandwiched together, I’d love to see the nice writing on the inner heart when she wears it. I was sent this to test and review. That has no bearing on my rating or review of it, this is my honest opinion.	2015-08-02
