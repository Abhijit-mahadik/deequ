But, were actually a little narrow, even though I ordered wide width. Also, if you have flat feet, or lower arches, these arch supports are a little too high.  After one wearing, I ended up giving these to a friend. They just weren't that comfortable.	2015-08-13

But they feel so comfortable that I really think they will fall apart pretty quickly. I live in the Deep South, so I don't really need water proof shoes often. If you do, don't get these. They are made for desert/dry areas. Also, I was skeptical of the non-spike grip. But I didn't slip at all.<br />One final note - if you are having to pay full price (around 90$) I wouldn't get these. I got them for 50$ and I'm happy. Had I paid twice that, I don't think the value would be acceptable.  This would be a 2-3 star review for that price point.	2015-08-13

I love these boots the height is perfect they won't make your legs look fat or like you have cankles and they're so comfortable.

So I purchased a pair of these due to word of mouth on how this was the &#34;Holy Grail&#34; of OCR shoes. First I would like to say that the shoes definitely feel like they are well made and will last. The first thing I notice when I tried them on was that the shoes have a very narrow toe box and could not accommodate my &#34;monkey toes&#34; (as my friends would call them). Since I can‚Äôt exactly test run the shoes and return them if unsatisfied I decided to wear them around the house for a whole day. They were fine at first, then I started to notice the pressure of the arch supports after about 2 hours of wearing them. I run Spartan Races and this would be of a great concern if you are running long distances. The shoe definitely does provide better cushion compared to the Rebook All Terrains which I run with. I can‚Äôt say much for the grip of the shoes since I haven‚Äôt really ran in them. I also cannot speak about the water draining issues regarding these shoes that I hear about, since I did not really run in water with them. Over all the shoes feel very well built but could use some tweaking such as wider toe boxes and less prominent arches. At the end of the day everyone‚Äôs feet are different and it comes down to preference. These shoes on the other hand are not for my feet.	2015-08-13

I suppose I can fix this by gluing some felt so the felt is between my food and the knot...or I could cut it off and just remove the metal thing.

Box was somewhat damaged, shoes had a couple slight little smuges on sides and back, but luckly i got my conditioner and cleaner so i just cleaned and conditioned them and put on water and stain repellent and now they look great. Only thing is the jump man part of the toungue wont stay latched to the little nub sticking out for it only the other shoe's toungue latch for the jump man works properly. For a pair of 450$ shoes i shouldnt deal with any of thay crap. They were in good condition looked somewhat new just had some little irritable smuges, that shouldn't have been there and the jump man latch not working is also rediculous as i payed nearly 500$ for these shoes they should be perfect out of box. I wouldnt have minded the smuges as it happens and they weren't bad at all, but the jump man toungue latch not working is not acceptable for 450$ shoes	2015-08-13

The seams by the laces are not sewn down like the Kinvara 5 Viziglo, and the rub of the seams caused irritation to the top of my foot (my big toe in particular).

Three months after purchase the rubber sole on both had split all the way through, the entire width of the shoe.  They also stretched out a lot to where they were too loose.  I don't think they are particularly narrow as other reviewers have said, especially given how much they stretch.

After having read the reviews, I was forewarned about its running small. I normally wear a Size 6 and ordered Size 7.  It was a perfect fit.  Not only was it a perfect fit, I felt like I was walking on clouds the minute I tried them on. The sole is thicker, offering more cushion than other flip-flops; they are like a second skin for my feet on the weekends, when I wear them exclusively. I am careful not to buy cheap ones that have thinner soles and wear out quickly. Although these were pricy, they are well worth the price--every single penny.  I would recommend them to anyone, especially if you need a little extra cushion to help protect and cushion your knees.	2015-08-13

Had eyeballed them in a store and wanted them though the retail shop only carried up to size 10 and the straps were just too tight for my comfort. All hail Amazon for carrying larger sizes! Though now that I've worn them for about a month I do notice that the strap is getting a little loose, so I'm wondering if maaaaybe I should have suffered through the too-tight size 10 for a bit only to find that it would loosen up to the perfect fit. Regardless, I'm happy.	2015-08-13

I have another pair of Merrell sandals, in fact over the years I have many, but this is the first pair that was not immediately comfortable to the point of my waning to wear them rather than go barefoot (which is my preferred state of being).  It is only the left shoe's toe and iI suspect it may be that something was sewn as tightly as it should have been-or my toe is weird.  In any case I will stick in the future with the Terran post sandals that I now have 4 pairs of and adore.  I am wearing these right now though and they are comfortable just not perfect.	2015-08-13

My 10 year old has flat feet just like I do so I knew she needed shoes that have excellent support and a good bottom to them. Her ankles also pronate A LOT and these shoes worked just as well as her old Nike Reax which they no longer make. It's hard enough to shop for a 10 year old that wears a women's 8.5, but when she has foot pain and is still growing it's ridiculous! These were a happy find.	2015-08-13

Probably the most perfect pair of shoes I have ever owned.<br />Growing up I spent most of my time barefoot and that is how I prefer to be.  Now that my husband and I live i our motorhome we are free to follow the weather that suits us (late spring/early summer) but most places have this funny ordinance about wearing shoes :-) I found my first pair of Terran post sandals in a TJ Maxx actually and loved them...and trashed them as I wore them all the time.  They were red when I got them and red with blue, green, and white splotches of paint a few bits of plaster and other stuff by the time I finally had to relegate them to the &#34;only outside around the house&#34;...I ordered a new pair of turquoise ones and then when we left my sister's house where we'd been staying I forgot my red ones and the new pair became my go to shoes.  Mind you, I have tons of other shoes and sandals.  Last week I finally decided that I would have to just accept the fact tat if I am not barefoot I want to be in my Terran Post sandals so I have a new red pair and a light beige (or whatever they call those colors).  I highly recommend them. They are comfortable, they look nice for all but the fanciest occasions (provided you don't spill stuff all over them) and they provide great support for high arches and in case you have to venture into the water with them (I don't think it's recommended) they stay on your feet.	2015-08-13

That said, I don't like that I wear different sizes with different styles. I am always sending shoes back and forth then. I normally wear a 9 in Cobb Hill. My Pandora boots are 9 M and roomy. I ordered a 9 narrow this time because it's a slip on; otherwise, the shoes will fall off my feet when I walk. The width was narrow enough, but the length wasn't long enough. I wanted to exchange for a 9.5 narrow, but they were out of stock. Now, the sale is over and they're too expensive. That's the downside of liking Cobb Hill shoes as much as I do: they're expensive.	2015-08-13

I wear them for riding my bike all the time. If I am going out to a bar or event, I don't have to change. They look like a cute pair of Mary Janes in the dark (except for reflective piping, ha). I will definitely order these as summer shoes again. The sole is removable, so if it wears out or you prefer another type, you can switch it out. I take it out and wrap a pair of flats socks over it to absorb any sweat (and easy take out to wash). I've worn these in the rain and they've been comfortable. They provide a good grip on my pedals, so I imagine they'd be great water shoes (I just haven't had the chance to test that theory).  Old post: I am still breaking these in, but so far pretty great. I can only wear them briefly when walking, as the heel has not broken in yet. I mostly wear these while riding my bike. Using a bandage and socks has made it so I could ride 40ish miles in them. There's a lot more of the reflective stripping than I originally assumed. Across the velcro strap, across toes, wrapping around the heel and up the heel to the back tag. Very helpful for riding my bike in the evening. Overall pleased, but I would definitely size up next time, a half size would be sufficient.	2015-08-13

I have looked around and was not able to find anything comparable. Having sunglasses in Arizona is a necessity, and because of lasik surgery I need the reading glasses to see. I used to be able to find reading/sunglasses combos at Costco but they do not carry them any longer and buying a prescription pair would be much more expensive. The only concern I have with this pair is the hinges are very tight. I hope that this doesn't put undo stress on the plastic ear piece and cause it to break. Time will tell how long these last, and if they do, they will be worth it.	2015-08-13

The first pair of running shoes I ever had were Asics Gel Kayanos over a decade ago.  They had an awesome feel like I was running on air.  As well, they solved a lot of foot and leg problems that I'd developed from running in shoes not specificly designed for running.  Because shoes change each year, I've never again found that fit/feel since that first pair.  These new Gel-Nimbus 17 are finally it.  They have the right amount of gel in just the right places and the soles provide the perfect ride for my weight (155 lbs.) and stride.  I bought these as a second pair and may even buy a third before they change them for next year.  Highly recommend the Asics Gel-Nimbus 17.	2015-08-13

I should have bought my normal 7.5 as I think they would be more comfortable and fit my feet like Tsubo shoes are meant to (very close and comfortably).  I can wear these with a slightly thicker sock and problem solved; I just hope they don't stretch out too much in the process!<br />The boot length along the calf is a bit wide for me.  My calves are neither large nor small.  It seems this is just a design issue.  Tsubo is my favorite footwear brand, but these are not my favorite from them.  That's not to say that I won't be wearing them regularly come fall onward, because Tsubo's structure is comfortable on the feet, your posture, and their shoes last.	2015-08-13

They kind of remind me of &#34;nurse shoes&#34; - well made, and comfortable!<br /><br />***UPDATE***  I am adding an update to my review and downgrading my rating from 5 stars to 3. My daughter had worn her shoes maybe 3 or 4 times and one day when I went to school to pick her up, she was standing in line holding the sole of one of her shoes in her hand! I fixed it with a tube of Shoe Goo, but I cannot believe the entire sole came off!	2015-08-13

A review from Mrs. L . . .<br /><br />Oh! My!  I went into a meeting the other day with my new purse hanging over my shoulder and everyone exclaimed about how nice my purse was!  It got passed around the table so everyone could look inside!  I told everyone that when it arrived, it was wrapped like I just just purchased it at a very nice store.  When I opened the wrapping it was sent in, I realized the picture on Amazon did not acurately depict how beautiful this purse truly is!!!!!<br /><br />First of all, the purse is very elegant lookiing, but it can also be used for casual wear.  Carry it by the handles or use the shoulder strap. Either way is comfortable. I was able to fit a LOADED purse organizer, two iPads, cell phone, and a book in it.  The sides unzip to make the purse wider without making the purse look bulky. There are organizing pockets inside the purse and a convenient zippered pocket on the back so that one might readily access a cell phone or keys.  The stitching on the purse is perfect. I cannot find a slipped stitch or knot.  The gold decorations are well attached and give a nice appearance to the purse.  The lining of the purse is well done and the lining color compliments the color of the purse. The purse color is sheer perfection. A nicely toned darker red so that it easily fits in with many different outfits. It is not a harsh glaring red.<br /><br />It's just a beautiful, classy purse.  I would have expected to pay much more for a purse of this quality.	2015-08-13

This expansion from a 12D to (apparently) a 13W is undoubtedly due to going barefoot a lot of the time while you snowbound suckers are stomping around in your insulated boots.<br /><br />I've ordered some 13W shoes from other vendors such as Zappos and King-Size, but in some cases the width and length haven't been enough (yes, that's what *she* said). I bought a pair of Hush Puppies in another semi-casual shoe and found that a 13W was both long enough and wide enough (oh, never mind), so I ordered these with confidence.<br /><br />The shoes are pretty nice, especially for less than the $120 or so I usually pay for Clarks. Astonishingly, though, they're almost *too* wide. I'm keeping them anyway, since the trend for my feet probably means they'll be okay if I put on socks. Early quality assessment is fine: good support, pretty solid/thick soles.	2015-08-13

I ordered the 11's with a pair of high heels inserts they fit GREAT!!! Extremely comfortable to be 5inches high! Sexy, cute, classy & edgy...just the way I love my heels!<br /><br />The only slight draw back is....if you have a narrow foot you may not want to purchase these OR try your exact size. They're certainly good for a fuller or wide foot! Enjoy them!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Shoe Connoisseur	2015-08-13

In saying that, these flats I will continue to buy faithfully.<br /><br />They are seriously perfect! Like any shoe, it takes time for your feet to break into them. I chose to walk to work in them to further break them in, and yes sometimes it would hurt but c'mon no shoe is going to automatically conform to the diverse range of foot types out there. This is coming from a girl who has some awkward a** feet.<br /><br />So all in all, I would buy them. Easily and without a doubt in my mind, they are the best flats you can get for the buck. I am really happy I ordered them, and I will be buying a back-up pair very soon.	2015-08-13

I get compliments every time I wear them. The leather is soft a stretchy. I really like the rustic vibe these shoes have. They are comfy but the bottom is leather, I think and they can be slippery. This is an easy fix if you so to your local shoe place and have them soled with some rubber (what I did) or you can buy one of those stickers you put under the shoe to not slip. The shoe runs a bit big but not too much. Going half a size down worked perfect for me. If you can, try them on at your local department store then buy them online for a better price (what I did). I would buy these shoes again and I would recommend them too!	2015-08-13

A purse that is small enough not to weigh a ton with enough pockets to keep everything organized.  I would have given it 5 stars but there was a handful of  weird clay &#34;rocks&#34; between the lining and the exterior of the bag.  I had to open a seam in the lining to dump all the garbage out.  I cleaned it out and stitched it back up and will keep it, but don't like paying $40 for a bag with rocks sewn in it!  Other than that, I love this bag.	2015-08-13

I normally wear a size 6 1/2 and got the 6.  It's strange the shoe had plenty of toe room and my heel was comfortable perhaps ever so slightly a bit big (but still good enough).  What was terrible about the shoe was the top part that fits over the round part of top of your foot.  The shoe was incredibly tight.  I had to shove and wiggle and push and pull to get my foot in.  To get it off it was a struggle and my foot would come out with the imprint of the leather all over my skin it was so tight.  I tried wearing them in the house and tried stuffing newspaper in the hopes they would expand but they were way too tight.  My feet were tingling.  I never knew I had a fat foot.  Maybe I will try a tennis shoe.  The return was excellent.  I went to a UPS store and sent them off with the labels Amazon provided and paid zero money out of my pocket.  Yeah.  Within an hour or so of sending it off I got a text stating a refund was in process and would appear in my account in 2-3 days.  I was shocked at getting a text so fast.  Maybe I have fat feet (I am not overweight by the way, just average size) and they may be okay for you.	2015-08-13

They fit a bit small, I am size 8 and ordered size 8.5 - fits perfect. No issues with the tights area being too small, I was worried about that since my tights are not skinny and I have muscles too. Overall, the shoes look just as pictured, they are very sexy and unique but of course don't expect great comfort - great shoes for a photo shoot or night out.	2015-08-13

They are very comfortable, maybe just a tad short on the big toe--Just a tad.  I normally wear a 7.5 and the 8 was the perfect size for me to buy.  The funny thing is that I bought the 7 for my daughter who wears a 6.5 and they were ginormous.  I mean, the backstrap was half an inch from her heel--way too big.  I actually used these as water shoes at the beach and they did the job fine.  They are great to wear around the house and outside and very comfortable for all day wear.	2015-08-13

If I had known that the 20's were going to be the WORST running shoes on the planet, I would have purchased at least 3 more pairs of the 19's. Lesson learned... Anyway, I've been a runner for almost 20 years. I supinate slightly, and I suffer from shin splints and chronic knee pain, so it's VITAL that I have a good running shoe. After striking out with 2 other kinds of Asics (which I would have swore were the best running shoe on the market, up until they ruined the Kayano) I tried these Sauconys. WOW. These are amazing!!!! They are much lighter than the Kayano, but they offer far superior cushioning. They are roomier and more breathable, and I love, love, love, them. Straight out of the box, with no break-in time, I went for a 7 mile run. I didn't experience any pain in my shins or knees, and they were so light and cool, that I felt like I could have run in them all day. Time will tell if the quality and lifespan matches my favorite Kayanos, but so far, I absolutely love these shoes, and would definitely recommend them.	2015-08-13

I really love the shoe and did not wish to have to deal with the hassle of returning it, so I am currently having it stretched by a shoe maker. So if you are a true C/D this may not be the shoe for you.	2015-08-13

He just gave them to a friend.	2015-08-13

I ordered a size 14 mens and received a size 14 womens which comes out to a size 12.5. It mentions nothing on the order page that the sizes are for women, and states clearly in the description that these are mens shoes. There is no way to contact the seller for a return/replace item and I don't own a printer since it's 2015, so I can either pay to return shoes I made no mistake in ordering which would cost half as much as what I paid for the shoes in the first place or I can find a woman that wears a size 12.5 and gift them to her. Frankly both options are difficult.	2015-08-13

These slippers allow those of us with plantar fasciitis to wear slippers again - ahhh! The only reason I didn't rate this as five stars is that the price is ridiculously high for a pair of slippers (!) and the Orthaheel quality has declined in recent years. Their products just don't last as long as they used to, which is really a bummer given the high price. But I pay it, because preventing a PF flareup AND being able to wear slippers again is AH-mazing.	2015-08-13

At first I loved these shoes, so light weight I felt like I was wearing comfy slippers with support. I wore them to work, around the house and on errands. Casual wear. Then I took them on holiday as walking shoes, mostly for the times I would be in the city. No. Just no. After about an hour of walking my feet ached. The bridge seemed to tight, and the support i had in casual day to day wear disappeared into ouchy tired feet. Then, rain. I wore them in the rain, because I was on holiday, it rained and I was out in London walking. They never really dried completely, were soaked through, and my feet just hated them. They ended up in the bin after 3 days of sitting on a radiator to dry and still feeling like a wet blanket. I ended up walking around the rest of the tim ein my Doc Maarten  oxfords, which though much heavier kept my feet dry, plenty of support and good tread. Okay maybe these were not designed for walking shoes. What were they designed for? Added note- they run narrow, which I liked, my feet are slightly narrow, however I have very high arches and had to leave them very loosesly tied as the top /bridge of my foot was full on aching if I tied them even slightly tight.I'm happy with my other skechers that are just slip on no tie  shoes.	2015-08-13

Since these are polarized it helps you look into the water and actually see the fish and they are inexpensive enough that if they fall off or you lose them its nothing to cry over.  Now with that being said I want to tell you about the quality.  These glasses are made out of pretty thin metal and bend kind of easy. I would equate the quality to a $10-$15 pair of glasses from the department store, but since they are polarized the higher price tag is on par with what you are getting.<br /><br />I really want to give these 3.5 stars because they are not really bad, but I feel like they will not last more than a few years with me being careful with them.  In all honesty if you are using them as an extra set of glasses its not bad at all and I would recommend them to you. Even if you are using these as your primary pair it might be ok, just don't expect miracles and high end quality and durability.<br /><br />***I received these at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion***	2015-08-13

The most disappointing thing about these glasses though is that the description says they're polarized- THEY ARE NOT POLARIZED. That was the main reason I bought these instead of other glasses of a similar style. When I received them I was actually worried they were broken as they were shipped in a box that was all smashed up, but luckily they weren't- they were shoved to one side of the rectangular box and the opposite corner smashed to make it a triangular  box. I guess that works as they made it safely in one piece. The description also lists the frames as both plastic and metal which may be confusing- the frames are metal except for the black ring that goes around the lens and the black part that goes over your ear. The metal frame seems fairly strong, they're nicely made, are tinted dark and work well as regular sunglasses, and the blue purple color the lenses reflect is a lovely color. They don't have a traditional nose-piece, the black plastic that makes up the inner frame stretches to create the nose contour. They're fairly comfortable aside from being narrow- if you have a wider head these definitely won't fit.	2015-08-13

After completing the trip, all I can say is that these boots are under-advertised. I bought them because the manufacturer's advertising and reviewers' comments suggested that both the workmanship and the materials were excellent and because they were made in the US. What I discovered is that they are also tremendously comfortable. &#34;Comfortable&#34; in two senses. The first is that the tongue is fashioned in such a way that tightening the laces does not discomfort the top of the foot. I have previously worn both Vasques and Lowas. Neither is nearly as kind to the top of the foot. The second sense in which these boots are comfortable is that they generously support the foot. Crossing Paintbrush Divide, I was aware that I was crossing a field of loose scree. Aware, that is, because I could hear the crunching sound of the rocks, knew that I was searching for a sound footing. What I didn't feel was a lack of support for my foot. As someone who suffers from plantar fasciitis, these boots were as comfortable as my running shoes with orthotic inserts! Buy these boots for their quality! Buy them because they're made here! Most importantly, buy these boots for their comfort.	2015-08-13

I wear them to the gym to lift and run in. They run a half size small. I measured my foot according to the chart provided on the shoe's page and they're definitely snug. However, I only wear them to work out in and my workouts usually last an hour and a half or so.. So they're just right.

The only drawback is that after a few days of heat and humidity, it's good to wipe the inside footbed with a wet wipe or give them a quick wash to keep the soles of the feet from getting too stinky. But this will happen in any shoe of this kind and the ability to wash them out more than compensates.<br /><br />These were worn right out of the box for a three week on-foot-run-around-everywhere sightseeing tour on hard, soft, and cobbled surfaces. No problems at all for both kids and adults. Note that both kids and adults usually spend their time barefoot - this was the next best thing.	2015-08-13

Owner of shoes: I picked these instead of Timberlands because who wants to pay $54 for a pair of boots? They're really light. They might feel kinda weird at first but that's probably just me since I'm not used to boots. They bend in the back and in the front on the top when you walk but you might be able to flatten the creases out. My main problem is that they smudge fairly easy. If you walk too wildly in them them you won't notice at first but eventually they'll get shiny marks on the sides. I haven't tried fixing the marks but I'm sure they might be repairable.	2015-08-13

I've been  New Balance shoe wearer for running for about 10 years.  I purchased these to replace my 1080V4.  Here is my review.....The heel is wider than prior versions, so my foot feels like it's slipping out  My biggest complaint is the tongue of the shoe.  It's very uncomfortable. It's a bit too long and narrow and scrunches up when I wear them, so I have to keep pulling at it or adjusting it.  In addition, I'm not sure you can see it in photos, but there is a decorative bit of threading across the top 1/3 of the tongue which is very uncomfortable.  For my first couple of runs, I thought my sock was getting twisted inside my shoe so I kept stopping to pull them.  Finally I realized, my socks were fine, it was the bulky threading that I was feeling.  Bummer, because it isn't functional, just supposed to be decorative.  Definitely uncomfortable.  Proceed with caution.  Maybe try them on at a local store before committing to the expense.  Unfortunately I think I'll need to replace these sooner than expected due to the discomfort.  I hope that's not what New Balance was counting on:(<br />My runs average 6-8 miles.  May not be a factor if you average less than that.	2015-08-13

Almost too much padding in the upper and the boot looks different than the advertising picture of it. The upper is so full of padding that it is impossible to draw the laces up tight on the leg and this failure allows your boot sock to rub your ankle raw. I have 6 pairs of Keen's and this is the first and only disappointment. Perhaps it is occurring because I am used to wearing military boots and they feel like house slippers next to these boots. Maybe I expect too much because I love my other shoes by Keen.	2015-08-13

I ordered a 7 (in the tan greenland), because that is my size in almost every shoe, they do fit but are a tiny bit long in the toe, nothing a fat sock wouldn't fix. They dont slip in the heel bed at all. The colour is darker than in the photo but absolutely gorgeous, The choice box for saying if these have good arch support is either yes or no, I had to go with no but the arch support is no different than any other boot with no heel, I dont have problem arches so I dont notice anything with the arches. These boots are so comfortable!! and the leather is thick but still pliable. They do have a chemical smell to them when you open the box but it quickly dissipates. I think its from what ever chemical process they used to distress the look of this boot. If your sitting on the fence about this boot, I say buy it!	2015-08-13

After a nasty dealing with Hanna Andersson customer service, I refused to purchase anything from them, however, my daughter had her heart set on these shoes for school.  I was so happy to see I could purchase them through Amazon!  I was actually very surprised at the quality of these shoes as I really wasn't expecting much from a clothing brand.  I used Hanna Andersson sizing when I purchased these and ordered a half size up, however, these are huge, so I took off a star since they're too big for her to wear comfortably at this point.  These have really good arch support and they seem to be very well made.  I'm also happy to report that the &#34;glitter&#34; isn't glitter and it doesn't leave a sparkly trail everywhere!  The strap is a little too long and touches the floor, but overall, I'd recommend this shoe.	2015-08-13

I liked the style and construction of the shoe but had to return for a fit issue.  I wear a 9.5 and have wide feet.  If no wide width is available I usually order up to a 10M but got the 9.5 M in these due to the recommendation of Amazons new sizing wizard.  I won't say the wizard is wrong  These do seem to run large in length as well as width.  However, even though these felt wider than a medium shoe one of the stripes on the side rubbed against my pinky toe.  Had the entire upper been mesh it wouldn't have been an issue.  Since these are hiking shoes,  I know if I notice it right away when I put them on it will be a blister later.  As far as the length, they were longer than a typical 9.5 medium.  The heel and arch area are narrow, which I liked, so I don't think this would have been an issue for me.  Good padding, good arch support.  The size tag in the shoe says US 9.5 UK 8 EU 42.  Depending on what size chart you consult a 42 would usu equate to US women's size 10.5 or 11.  I don't think the sizing was that way off, but I would say these are a solid 1/2 size bigger.	2015-08-13

My 3 year old son loves batman and ofcourse the light up shoes, pure awesomeness. And when I opened them up I was really impressed by the quality, and that's something I can be a real stickler about because it makes a huge difference to me considering wear and tear on the shoes and the overall comfort of the shoe to my boy. I seriously stared at the shoe for like 30 minutes examining the cool little batman shoe thinking to myself, &#34;wow these are super nice&#34;. The material of the shoe is really well done especially for a 3 year olds shoe. They look extremely comfy with the entire shoe made nicely lightweight. I'm definitely really happy with them for my sons birthday gift, I'm sure he'll love them. So good buy if you're interested and unsure!	2015-08-13

Be aware there are two different shoes here that fit differently. The ones with the white plastic buckle tend to run true to size or even a little big. I wear an 8 or 8 1/2 depending on the shoe and I wore an 8 in the plastic buckle shoes. The plastic buckle shoes also have a different sole. (see pictures below)  I like these the best even though the buckle on one broke immediately. It was an easy fix. The metal piece in the buckle came off. I snapped it back on and used needle nose pliers to crimp it so it does not come off again. Then I did this to all of the ones with a plastic buckles even before I wore them just to make sure it does not happen again. After wearing these a couple times, I no longer need to unbuckle them. I can just slip them on and go. These are by far my favorite.  Any spot that rubs my foot at all, I put a spot on. I do this with all my shoes and never have issues. Spots work miracles! The ones with the metal buckle fit differently. They seem to run a little small and for some reason were very uncomfortable for me in the toe area even in an 8 //2. I returned them after buying several pair and nothing felt good on my foot. I think the metal buckle ones are better quality. Look at the toe area between the two types. The metal buckles have smaller and less toe room. They are also a more flat platform.   In summary, the plastic buckle runs slightly big and has a different angle that looks fantastic and makes your legs look like you are wearing heels even though they are completely comfy. The metal buckle runs small, has a different sole and is more of a flat platform.  ALSO NOTE YOU PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING IF THEY DON&#34;T FIT IF YOU BUY FROM SHOE CENTER - So basically there is no return because it cost more to ship it back than the shoe is worth.   Here are the spots which you can buy just about anywhere. Also available in non-gel. http://smile.amazon.com/Foot-Support-Soft-Pads-VIVEsole/dp/B00SXSEM00/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1439485604&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=spot+cushions+for+shoes  I hope this review saves someone from all the returns I have done.

Not quite sure why they call this purse a cross body? I can tell you that it is a very nice purse. It has 3 pockets on one side and inside the biggest pocket there is another zipped pocket and a velcro-fastened pocket. Inside this same zippered outer side pocket are 3 slots for credit cards and 2 slots for pens. There is also another slot that is not very deep and not very wide, that I have no idea what it is used for. It is not big enough for lipstick or wide enough for a cell phone. On the opposite outside of the purse are 2 openings; 1 is zippered and large enough to hold a checkbook, note paper, or perhaps sales or credit cards receipts. The other pocket is magnetic-fastened and goes the width of the purse. Inside the main section is open with 1 zippered compartment, large enough for lipsticks. The shoulder strap is adjustable. The leather is very nice and feels very soft. It seems well made and I think it will last me a long time. I would recommend this purse to anyone who is like me an organizational junkie!	2015-08-13

My boyfriend and I recently signed up for gym memberships so I did a little searching online for the best jogging shoe. I'm not sure if this shoe is that best but for my budget, I am very happy with my decision to purchase this shoe. I feel I walk funny to begin with so finding a shoe that supports my awkward stance is important. The first day running in these shoes I felt airless. I definitely recommend them.

I do wear other brands of sneakers and can honestly say these are the only ones I feel support my foot properly for running on sidewalks and the street. I will probably buy another pair soon to stash away for the sad day I have to retire one of my current pairs. Also I get tons of compliments on them. I highly recommend!!!	2015-08-13

I'm a size 12.5 and sometimes half sizes are unavailable or downright tricky, but they fit perfectly right out of the box. I'm a casual athlete and found that they're at their best performance-wise indoors at the gym due to a relatively flat, minimal-traction sole. But no worries, they can be good for light road use too (just be prepared to replace them sooner than later). The most surprising part was how light they were and how well they breathe. You can almost feel wind blowing through the shoe due to a partly mesh upper. They almost feel like slippers! Overall these are excellent shoes for a variety of lifestyles. I might even think about getting multiple pairs as backups.	2015-08-13

Bald Tires after c.30 miles, that is worn down, smoothed-out soles after around 4 months. More than the wear shown on New Balance tennis shoes worn for 2 years! I started wearing these in August 2015 and by January 2016 I wouldn't wear them out on slippery winter surfaces, no tread or traction left.<br /><br />2. Stinky! By now nearing the end of March after another 20 miles I notice a stank when I take them off. Worse than any sneaks I've ever had in 50 years. Of course I've never had anything but leather, canvas or mesh. These are non-breathing &#34;man-made materials&#34;, i.e. plastic.<br /><br />Still, if a large toe box, good cushioning, and a decent instep are your priorities like my own, and you're wiling to toss them out way sooner than expected like I just did, read on to my initial review:<br /><br />/////////////////////////<br />Almost perfect, with small QC nitpicks<br />4E is a great fit for me, never had Avia before. I come from many years of New Balance tennis and trainers and Nike trainers, all 4E. These Avias are very roomy in the toe box, love that about them! NB widths are getting narrower and the Monarch's squeaks drove me nuts. I also really like the moderate arch support in these, perfect for me, and there's something very comfortable about walking in these with their Cantilever and Cradle. I'd give these 5 stars for comfort/design except for one thing, the factory Quality Control. This is my 3rd pair in a month because pair 1 had a too big insole - to the point where it was crinkled in the heel - pair 2 was shipped with too fat laces, amazing that a 16th of an inch difference could make the fat ones stick so hard in the not-very-good-at-all lace holes. New Sofsole laces are cheap at my local S.A. but I wanted to send this pair back anyway to get a half size bigger. And now this pair 3, with good sized insoles and laces, has sewn threads that needed to be clipped and are now starting to fray a bit after 2 weeks.<br /><br />All told I obviously wanted to stick with these and am now very glad I did despite these nitpicks. Good thing they're only half the cost of my previous brands!old I obviously wanted to stick with these and am now very glad I did despite these nitpicks.

Let me say first, these shoes are beautiful!! I just received mine today. I was so excited. And shipping only took a week. But, be warned!! These shoes run really, really small. I wear a 5 1/2 in tennis shoes. But I ordered these bigger considering that they do come from China. I orderedva size 7. And my toes are squished! There is no way I could wear these for even 5 minutes without being in pain. But I will be sending them back and re- ordering. Gonna try an 8 this time. I do reccomend these shoes. I love them. They are very well made. And very cute. Just remember, order at least 2 sizes up. Ok. I'm up- dating my review. I put on a thin pair of socks and re- tried the shoes. I have them on now. I'm walking around breaking them in a little. And I think I will be able to wear them after all. As I'm walking, I can feel them stretching a little. I'm hoping if I wear them a little everyday they are going to be ok!! I hope so. I love, love, love these shoes!! Any way, I hope this helps!! Good luck!	2015-08-13

To give some credit--for a week, I thought these were the best cheap glasses I'd ever owned.  These glasses fit my face well enough that, even with just 1 of the legs attached, they are still were able to protect me from the sun while driving.<br /><br />That being said: the achilles heel of these glasses is the weak part of all cheap glasses--the screws that attach the legs to the body of the glasses themselves.  They just fit poorly.  Within a week the screw was loose, then I was on all fours searching for it when it managed to fall out.  After the third time, all hope was lost, and I was left with a good looking set of glasses that were missing an integral part.<br /><br />The second pair is still working fine for my girlfriend, but I'd really hoped they'd last longer than a couple of weeks, even at this price.	2015-08-13

If you're a half size, go down rather than up. The size 6 is perfect (without thick socks). I prefer to wear them without socks. They are not only super cute, but very comfy. I almost didn't buy these because of all the bad reviews about them breaking. So far, I've only had them for about a week, but I wear them out in our chicken coop, cleaning and doing miscellaneous yard work, and I haven't had any problems. I have them in black, and I'm tempted to buy another pair in a different color since they're relatively inexpensive,  for a rain boot.	2015-08-13

I was worried when I read some of the reviews on the fit and finish of these sandals but I loved the style so much I figured I'd give them a shot.<br />So I'll address both:<br /><br />Fit: This worried me because I ordered &#34;wide&#34; and some said in their reviews that these weren't. I first opened the box and realized these were NOT wide and would never fit, but before sending them back I'd try to squeeze my foot into them. I pulled them on and to my surprise they were the most comfortable shoes I'd ever worn right out of the box!  I think the moral is, when it comes to fit... you just have to try them and not heed the reviews...on fit.<br />Finish: I attracted to these on appearance and they look great in person. The stitching and finish is very high quality and I found no loose threads or problems of any kind.The stretchy uppers provide lots of support and I've worn these all summer, all day, every day and 2 months in they still look and feel brand new.<br />Finally: Even though the pair I have now should last a long time, I just ordered another pair which I'll stow in a closet and break out whenever these are spent just in case they stop making this model.<br />Great Sandals!!	2015-08-13

For the price point these are a really nice pair of sunglasses.  I've had them for about ten months now, and they've stayed wear and scratch free for the most part.  I work outdoors, and I;ve went through my fair share of eyewear over the years.  And I've bought sunglasses near around the $30 price point that really weren't as good as these.<br /><br />Like I said, they've been pretty durable.  Unlike some other brands I've tried, these haven't fallen apart because of the heat.  And the lenses are quite scratch resistant.  Though it's obviously not scratch proof.  The frame itself is light enough that I barely notice I'm wearing anything on my face.  The entire unit is designed well enough that it has the all important feature of keeping direct sunlight out of my unprotected eyeballs.  So basically these do everything that I needed them to do.  So I can't say anything more than that these are a great pair on sunglasses for the price point.	2015-08-13

My first docs took me around the world (literally) and I wore them down to nothing before I finally threw them away.  They lasted 10 years with almost daily use and I could wear them comfortably all day.  These new ones made in Asia, not so much.  As soon as I opened the box I could tell that the quality was half of the previous docs I had.  I should have believed the reviews and spent twice as much for the originals.  The leather is way, way thinner.  The sole is half the thickness and not nearly as durable.  These boots actually made my feet hurt and I had to buy gel insoles for them.  I love the look and they way they fit but I seriously would have spent another hundred and bought the originals if I had known they would be this different.  It kind of makes me sad that they have slipped so much.  I have always sworn by my birks and docs and now the docs have lost my allegiance.	2015-08-13

I wear them 90% of the time.  Many of my friends are also believers in the benefits of Crocs.  Great for plantar fasciitis sufferers.  I've walked many a mile through large airports both in the U.S. and abroad in my Crocs.  Love them!	2015-08-13

Just received my Teva's and they fit PERFECTLY.  I was a bit nervous about the ankle strap, but I'm traveling soon to Cambodia & Vietnam and needed something that can be used in water, yet not too much shoe around my foot because of the humidity.  The slope of the sole is great, but for someone that needs a lot of arch support it might not work. Try it anyway.  Sure is comfortable on my foot and I have a difficult foot to fit.  My other Teva has more straps, but again, it is also more shoe than this one.  LOVE IT	2015-08-13

I wear them to work or to go out. They work as both semi-dressy and fairly casual. I get lots of compliments on them. They have held up pretty well - though, for the price, really, I don't expect them to last more than a year, but I'm really tough on shoes and walking is a big part of my commute every day. In short, they are a great deal for the price! My one small complaint is that they are a type of plastic (I personally prefer vegan shoes, though), so on hot days, my toes do get rubbed a bit. But I'm still buying another pair. So happy to see they are still available!  I always buy a 5.5/36 in sandals and the 5.5 fit perfectly.  EDIT: A couple of days after I wrote this review, they fell apart. WOMP. So, I am taking away a couple of stars. Don't expect to get lots of walking out of these. The straps are glued on in apparently a rather haphazard way. They were great while they lasted, but you get what you pay for.	2015-08-13

My complexion is brown -- sort of peanut shade. The shoe in tangerine is great for me; also my skin color and the shoe heel are close enough in color that it elongates my legs.  Anyway, every time I wear these shoes I get compliments (from women). The heel is unique but subtle, almost like a wedge (I don't like wedges), but without the clunky look. I am picky about my shoes - I won't wear uncomfortable ones, and I like to have sensation throughout my entire foot and be able to grip the shoe. The foot bed is very comfortable, a kind of brushed fabric. I like these because they are a snug fit and will never slip or fly off my foot. (I have a medium width foot.) I have walked as much as 4-5 miles in these at a time, and that wasn't ideal, but it was doable. I have stood in them for at least an hour at a time. There was a brief period about a year ago where some part of one of the shoes suddenly chafed -- it was very painful! I have no idea what happened. Maybe I had some sodium retention or put on a bit of weight (in my feet?) because after a few weeks that went away without me doing anything about it. Anyway, it resolved itself and I'm on my 3rd summer of these. I have not really taken care of them, so they look kind of beat up (I've posted pics). Note, that the leather has also weathered to a darker shade of tangerine. But I like them, they are casual enough to wear anywhere,  while giving height and being stylish.	2015-08-13

I would give 5 stars if they came in half sizes.  I normally wear an 81/2 in sketchers.  After reading reviews I ordered an 8 because a 9 is generally too big for me.  The bed of the shoe fits well but the top of my foot is tall so the strap is quite tight and hurts by the end of the day (I work on my feet).  I was amazed at how much the rest of the shoe stretches to the shape of your foot. So, these are my short day/walk shoes.  I get constant compliments on how cute they are and have recommended them often:). Also, this shoe is very lightweight and the wedge is sturdy so I don't worry about rolling my ankles.	2015-08-13

My daughter is not a huge fan on pink, so when I got these super adorable pink slippers I assumed I was safe from her stealing them from me.  Boy was I wrong.  These slippers are so soft and comfortable that the day after I got them I got home from work and she was wearing them!<br />These are a super soft terry cloth material and they literally feel like my foot is resting on a cloud. The bottoms are solid, which is great because we have an automatic ice maker and ice falls out and creates puddles on the kitchen floor and I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve stepped in those puddles in my slippers and it seeps through the bottoms and I hate that!  I can also wear them to run out to the car or to the mail box without ruining the bottoms‚Ä¶and if I‚Äôm feeling extra lazy for a quick run to the store (don‚Äôt judge, we‚Äôve all been there!)<br /><br />I normally wear an 8.5 to a 9 and I got a size large and they fit great, so maybe order a little bigger than your normal shoe size.  I would probably be okay buying a medium, but I prefer the fit of the large.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-13

It took just under 30 days from the time I shipped them back to Rockport. At least they replaced the defective shoes, hopefully these hold up longer.   edit (02/08/2016) Well, I purchased these shoes on August 13, 2015, It is now February 8, 2016. The shoes, while I've babied them, never wore in snow/salt. Only to work and back (I work at a desk) the sole is separating from both of the shoes.  Right out of the box these are the most comfortable pair of shoes that I've ever worn. Just got done working a 10 hour day and they feel better than being barefoot. Rockport makes my favortie shoes hands down. 12 EE (W) and I have a little roomier toe area than the lighter summer pair of Rockports that I own. I also own a year old waterproof ankle high shoe from Rockport and these fit the same as those.  Amazon was $20 cheaper than Zappos :-) - Also can't beat their customer service.	2015-08-13

I have trouble with my shoes bursting at the sides for some reason due to my foot and the leather has been holding well. Holds up great to ice and water along with general warehouse wear and tear. Good price point as I expect these will last me for around 2 years hopefully with how they have been treating me. Not worth buying a 40-50 dollar pair of shoes that fall apart after 5 months when an 80 dollar pair will last you over a year.	2015-08-13

These are nice for the price, but I totally forgot to think about how the color would affect the things I see. The red ones should not be worn while driving, because green lights become invisible and other colors also look strange. I took pictures with and without the sunglasses to illustrate how different things look through the red lens. If you see on the bottle of pet food supplement, the white writings on orange background become completely invisible. Also, many of the jelly beans end up looking the same despite being very different to the naked eye.  Something to keep in mind. If you're looking for sunglasses to wear while driving, don't get the red ones.<br /><br />The build itself is decent, and there's enough of a weight to it to make it feel not cheap. It also doesn't squeak like a lot of the cheaper sunglasses I've handled in the past.	2015-08-13

These sandals should be priced around $60 not $120! The leather looks/feels on the cheaper end and the velcro straps take away from the classiness of the look. For $120, I would expect a thicker, heavier stitched leather sandal rather than the thin leather straps that are used. Also, the combination of the thin leather  the velcro straps, makes me feel kinda ripped off.	2015-08-13

Very comfortable, much more than some of the other Pumas I've owned.  The reviews are correct - you need to buy at least a half size up.  I went up a half size and it fits snug, which is what I like.  I think it fits tighter because these shoes come with the Ortho Lite cushioning so maybe that tightens things up.  However, it makes for a much more comfortable shoe.  I bought the white on grey and the actual white/grey contrast is a lot more evident than you see in the pictures.  After a few months of use, the grey suede fades as expected but the white nylon stays pretty bright, which isn't perfect but ok for this price point.	2015-08-13

(Are you tired of the same old styles in athletic shoes like I am?)  I like the color, which is a dark, charcoal gray.  I have no idea why they call this color any shade of blue, they are the same color as the Amazon picture.  Because they are sturdy boots, I won't plan to take these on an upcoming trip since I want to wear them a bit before relying on them for miles of walking.  However, I can't wait to wear these as the weather cools a bit.<br /><br />I typically wear 8.5 B, but have had to size up in length and width to accommodate a special ankle/foot brace.  While other shoes in 9 C/D have fit me well, these are a bit more snug, but still work, and will fit even better after the leather softens with some use.  If you are looking for some cut but solid boots, these are well worth your consideration.  If you can pick them up at a discounted price like I did, it's a no-brainier... Get them!<br /><br />If you find the information in this review to be helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34;.  Thanks!!	2015-08-13

They are comfortable and high-quality. You can wear them for a walk in the woods but they are cute enough to wear with a skirt etc. Especially in black, these are a great all-around sandal! I have worn them pretty much every day since they arrived, with a number of different outfits and for a number of different uses. My only complaint is that when walking over tough terrain on a mountain, the velcro straps would occasioanlly pop open. Again, this was on a mountain - nothing like that ever happens with day-to-day walking. They also do well in the rain, good grip on the bottom and they dry quickly. They are extremely comfortable and as someone whose ankles hurt if I don't I don't have good support, I have zero problems with these. I like that basically all of the straps are adjustable so you can fit them to your foot. Highly recommended!!	2015-08-13

[[ASIN:B00G2DDEOS Baggallini Big Zipper Bag, Kiwi, One Size]]<br />I don't think I'm the first person to experience this with a Baggallini purse. I really do love it and this is my second Baggallini (I also have the Bon Voyage Bagg which I love when I travel without 'the Mom bag') so this is very disappointing. The hardware link that the strap clips on to is attached to the bag with a fabric strip that is sewn into the bag and the zipper.  I did not start using this Big Zipper bag until June 10, 2015 and it broke August 9, 2015. Two months to destroy a purse...that's a new record for me. It was not abused, overstuffed, used as a trapeze by young children, yanked out of subway doors as the train pulled away or anything else that might fall outside 'normal wear and tear.' I was left with a useless bag away from home for a week. The only way I could make it work as a purse was to leave it unzipped and clip the purse strap through the open zipper (as shown in attached image). A Pickpocket's Delight. My main disappointment is that this is an upscale bag for me...not my usual Target 30% off bargain summer purse...and I expected more. This was for a European vacation. Of course it's beyond the return period so I guess I get to repair it myself and live and learn: sometimes you DON'T get what you pay for. What can you learn from my experience? Go ahead and buy this purse...it really is a great bag for travel and everyday use, BUT when you receive it, give the fabric a good once over and check for weakness in the stitching. I'm guessing I could have caught it at that point and sent it back. Now I'm left holding the bagg...tee, hee.	2015-08-13

Fit in the toes was a little tight the first day or two wearing them, as described by others. Now they are great, heels don't slip off even with hose/tights on.  Recommend hose/tights the first several times you wear them to make sure they ease onto your feet well. Wore them for the first time without hose yesterday and they were plenty comfortable and fit fine that way too now that they are broken in.  I would buy more pairs in different colors if I needed more heels. I might anyway.	2015-08-13

And if these don't cause them, nothing will! YEEEOUCH!!! My actual shoe size is 9.5 W, so when I order a size 10, they're usually a little long in length, but otherwise comfortable. These are perfect in length, but too tight in width. I can actually feel pain and pressure at the base of my big toes, right where my foot bends. My toes also feel crammed into the pointy toes on these shoes. I love pointy toe shoes and own several other pairs that are far more comfortable than these. I was concerned that the style with the lower heel might not look as sexy as the higher heel version, but they are just as sexy. They are cut sufficiently low on the sides, without feeling like they're going to fall off when I walk, and they do show a little &#34;toe cleavage.&#34; If it weren't for the lousy fit and pain they cause, I would have given 5 stars. I hope they start making these wider and with a little cushioning. Then I would love them. As for these, I HATE the hassle of returning things, so I'm giving all 3 pairs away. ***UPDATE*** I've upgraded my review from 2 stars to 3 stars, due to exemplary customer service. I was contacted by the seller, who offered to resolve this matter for me in a very professional and satisfactory manner. The customer service is worthy of 5+ STARS! Although I cannot wear these shoes myself, I do have 2 family members with narrow feet and feel that these would make great gifts. With customer service like this, my confidence has been restored.	2015-08-13

Now, I see what they mean:  it's as close to being barefoot as I've been without actually being so.  They have excellent grip and tread, and they're light and 100% cotton for muggy Illinois summers.<br /><br />I generally wear heavy work boots, as I'm the primary keeper for a wildlife education facility, and every day my proverbial dogs are barkin' by mid day.  I've been wearing these for a week, and my feet feel AMAZING!  Granted, they're also more vulnerable to heavy objects, but thats the tradeoff.<br /><br />I'll say, too, there is a trick to the sizing.  Saw someone who got one full size lower than their actual shoe size, and that worked for me (I'm size 8.5, so I ordered 7.5 US, which is 26 Japan, if I recall correctly).  They will be snug at first, sometimes painful, but wear them as much as you can and the material will stretch enough to be PERFECT for your foot.  Well, that was my experience, anyway.	2015-08-13

Yeah--for a few seasons I was wondering if I could find a Dansko sandal that was comfortable, stylish,  and easy to take care of.  Stylish and comfortable; they feel like a closed shoe and are very supportive, but look like a very stylish sandal.  The pewter and bronze make them versatile in terms of matching outfits.  Footbed is cushioned and will be easy to keep clean.  I have high arches, usually a worry with such straps,  but these sandals feel great, thanks to the discrete elastic goring on the straps and the placement of the buckle. I ordered the same size I wear in the closed Dansko clogs, and these  fit as expected.  Wish they came in other colors (how about a dark brown?).	2015-08-13

The bag is much smaller than I expected. The bag does have a lot of pockets - too many pockets, in my opinion. The zippers keep getting caught on the fabric when I try to zip them. Plus, getting my phone out of this bag when someone calls me in my car is a nightmare. Items get lost in the abyss of the very small individual pockets. I bought the bag right before going on a business trip. I would have sent it back if I was not so busy. If you are looking for a bag that is big enough to be a carry-on but without the massive amount of useless pockets which get caught in the zipper - then do not buy this product.<br />Regards,<br />~ Holley Jacobs	2015-08-13

I used to buy him Keens or other &#34;quality&#34; name-brand sandals until he reached men's sizes--crazy prices to pay when I can see the boy's feet growing before my eyes!  Also crazy to invest in shoes when if i let him, he would wear flip flops year-round (even in winter!). When we go somewhere flip flops are not appropriate, he wears these sport sandals. He also uses them as beach or stream shoes since they are waterproof.	2015-08-13

They're as awesome as I'd hoped they would be after reading aaaaaalll the reviews online and researching for days!  I really don't like to buy clothing or shoes over the internet, but there was no way to find good rainboots in my area (SoCal -- hello, drought? But I'm now ready for the next El Nino! )  These boots are absolutely as adorable as they looked online (biker boots! in a fairly shiny black vinyl-looking stuff--super cute in a very classic style).  The inside has a wonderfully soft lining that also slightly cushy -- great for preventing rubbing spots, even when wearing with bare feet, as I did.  The toe-box is lovely--nice and roomy but not so much so that my toes slide around.  The ONLY negative I have so far is that the boots seem a bit SNUG across the top of my foot (the part that'd be under the laces and bow-tie if they were sneakers).  It's not uncomfortable, per se, but I definitely won't be able to wear thick socks with these boots.  However, the snugness does keep my heels from sliding up and down, so it's not so bad.  Since the boots are rubber (vinyl? or whatever), I'm hoping that the material stretches a bit with wear and that eventually they'll be looser.  I mainly plan to wear these in rain and warmer weather (like, above 50 degrees?), so I'm not worried about the sock issue.  I'm just bummed that there was this slight problem with what are otherwise fantastic boots.  Also, I do have a pretty high arch, so it might be that others don't have as much of a problem with them....  All in all, I definitely recommend these boots as being worth a try.  I'll try to remember to update my review once I've worn them for a while and given them a good workout. Whatever you decide -- enjoy your new boots!  :-)	2015-08-13

Have been wearing them for years. Decades, even. Always a consistent fit. Always comfortable. That is until this shoe. Not only does it seem to have a design flaw that's well documented by others (the small &#34;slip on&#34; hole), but the sides of this shoe are pretty tall and rub against my ankle bone. After a bit, this temporary pain goes away, so I guess I'm getting used to it. Or else the shoe is getting used to my ankle. Hard to tell at this point. Another flaw is that the insert comes out every time your foot does. It's a pretty tight fit, that hole. Of course when I'm sitting idly, like at my desk, it's an AMAZING shoe. But as a hiking shoe, the jury is still out.	2015-08-13

When you need a shoe that can withstand nature, a pair of ol Nike's is not gonna work.  I was in search of a good shoe for awhile and stumbled upon these after seeing quite a few fellow Spartan racers sporting these at a recent Spartan race.  I sheepishly asked some chiseled dude - as he raced down in front of me, jumping and conquering giant rock obstacles, all while maintaining perfect David-esque balance and poise - the name of the shoes he was wearing.  I heard &#34;Innovate&#34; faintly in the distance as he jumped over a Berlin wall as if the Germans were coming.<br /><br />After doing lots and lots of research - because who wants to pay more than 100 bux for a shoe whose whole purpose is to get destroyed- I found that the 200 is actually a bit wider than some of the other Innov8 brands that are out there.  And since I have wider feet - at least I think i do - i decided to opt on these.<br /><br />It's weird to compare these to any other shoe.  They are minimalist feel but yet have cleet-like spikes at the bottom so its quite a strange feeling.  After wearing them to a recent Spartan race for the first time, I can say that they definetely live up to the hype.  The shoe was very comfortable.  I have some odd shaped toes in which my second toe is bigger than the rest (dont judge).  And so after long runs - especially trails - i tend to get all kind of weird bruises on my toes.  I did not with these.  They were very comfortable in the front and heel. My only complaint, which really is not a complain but more of a something-to-get-used-to, is that the cleats on the bottom can be felt very prominately when running on hard or spiky surfaces.  Im not sure if there is anyway around this.<br /><br />So far i've run a couple trail runs with these.  I have not seen really any wear and tear on them as of yet. I will certainly update if and when I do .. but so far they are great shoes specifically to run crazy ass obstacle mud runs.	2015-08-13

They are also beautiful, very well made and comfortable enough to walk around in all day.  They are NOT for athletic, fuller calves, however.  My calves measure 13&#34; in circumference at their fullest part and the boots measure 14.25&#34; at the top of the shaft.  This leaves enough room for jeans to be tucked in, but just barely.  These are measurements for a size 8.  Calf size probably increases a bit with each succeeding size, and it could decrease with smaller sizes.  There is no zipper, so they can be challenging to get on in the beginning.  I'm 5'5&#34; and they stop at 1.5&#34; below the bottom of my kneecap.  The height of the boot from the floor to the top of the shaft (measured at the side) is 17&#34;.  They really are special;  rugged looking but at the same time sleek and streamlined.  Mine are the dark bown, and I plan to buy another pair in black. Yes, they are expensive, but with a little care they should last a lifetime.  It's an investment worth making!	2015-08-13

The pistol pocket is perfect for my S&W M&P Shield 9mm, and it even has enough room for me to have my pistol in it's holster, and that keeps it more secure, and allows less movement of my firearm. Lots of good sized pockets, and I realize now it says earrings will come with it - but I hadn't noticed that when I ordered it, and I love the matching wallet, and the earrings were an excellent surprise - they're beautiful just like the purse!	2015-08-13

Love these flip flops!<br />I usually were a 7 in most crocs that are shoe like (covered toe and covered heel). I ordered size 8 in the flip flop and found them to be a great fit!  The size 8 is 10&#34; long from end to end and 4&#34; wide side to side at the widest point.  My foot is just under 9.5&#34; long and just under 4&#34; at its widest part (ball of foot).  So that leaves me with a 1/4&#34; at front and back of shoe and just wide enough to fit my normal/somehwat wide foot.  I find most flip flops  to narrow for my foot, not these!  (In most shoes I wear a 7.5 wide or an 8 regular)<br /><br />And now for the tip.  Throw your crocs in the dryer with a few damp towels on Medium heat for about 7-10 minute (enough time in my dryer)  and when they are warm to very warm, (but not scalding hot!) take them out, slip them on your feet and stand /walk until they cool off (about 5 minutes) Doing this will get them to stretch and conform to your foot, both the foot bed and the strap.  This only works with the croclite  material type shoes such as these flip flops.  I have done this with all my crocs of this material and when ordering a 7, they stretch a bit to fit my foot perfectly,  No slipping off and no rubbing/break in time.  If they stretch out over time, throw them back in for a re-fitting.  Try it, you love the fit afterward!  (if you have no dryer - try your hair dryer on hot to heat them up (but not scalding as you don't want to injure your feet)	2015-08-13

I hate giving anything a bad review, but for me, I could feel a blister coming on the ball of my foot almost immediately. I have plantar fasciitis and osteoarthritis in my big toe, so I am desperate to find something that allows me to be on my feet for my twelve hour shifts. I don't think I will be able to continue to work for the next 13 years if I don't find shoes that don't hurt my feet. I was so hopeful because this product got so many good reviews, but it didn't work for me.  I am not a returner, it takes too much effort on my part, or I would. All these special shoes can get pricey, I don't want to keep wasting money on shoes that won't help.	2015-08-13

I really love them and am very happy I purchased them.  The one thing I noticed while wearing them it that they are slippery. Your foot slides when you walk so you have to have good toe control to keep them on. The bottom (where your foot sits on) is shiny. I would have liked it to be a different material so your foot wouldn't slide all over when walking. Other than that I do really love the shoe.	2015-08-13

Bought for my toddler, these crocs have taken a beating including floating in our pool, stomping in puddles, splashing in rain. They still light up and he loves them.  They fit great as most crocs do, they are light weight considering that they light up, and they are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  The white teeth have even stayed considerably clean.  These are his favorite go-to summer shoe and hands down worth every penny. He has been wearing them for several months now. UPDATE: My son has just outgrown these shoes.  While they have scuffed a little, they have withstood being washed a number of times and have not lost their lights.  Plus I liked that their color is not too garish and they match most outfits.  This was a good, sensible purchase.	2015-08-13

I tried the 9 which seemed okay but showed a ton of toe cleavage and slipped off of the back of my foot if I was walking at a good pace.  I ended up keeping the 8's instead even though my toes are a little more confined because they stay on my foot better.  There is a tiny bit or arch support but not a ton.  I'm not sure how these will be after a full day of wear, it did seem like my foot would get sweaty in them since they are rubber material and don't breath.  I'll find out tomorrow in the rain how they fair.	2015-08-13

The sole on the red slipper has a fabric embedded in the rubber which is different from the allspice slipper sole. The sole fabric offers little traction on our tile floors and is proving to be a hazard, especially for an elderly person.

I loved this shoe	I've been buying this particular Keds tennis shoe every year since it was first made.  But no more.  They have now reduced the arch support to nothing. There's no arch support in the shoe I was sent.  Just a cheap, flat piece of junk.  They had to figure out a way to save money, and they ruined this shoe as far as I'm concerned.  And it is not the arch support that is shown in the individual image of the inside of the shoe, on the Amazon web site & at the top of this page.  The arch support is a very important feature to me.  I used to wear them all day long, now only a few hours because of no arch support.  I would not have ordered this shoe had I known this.  I won't be buying any more, and it makes me sad.  I loved this shoe.  It would be nice if Keds read this and would send me a pair of the arch supports, as advertised here, the good ones like they used to put in this Keds.

For under $10, I figured I'd gamble with buying sunglasses online. After I took them out of the box, however, the first thing I noticed was that the plastic was very rigid and cheap-feeling and they were too small to fit on my face. I used them maybe two or three times over the course of a week and then came the big test: wearing them to an all-day music festival. After having them on for most of the day, I took them off while we got a little bit of rain. When the sun came back out, I grabbed these glasses, went to put them on my face, and the plastic rim snapped right above the right lens. Out of anger, frustration, and surprise, I shook my head and immediately threw them into the nearest trash can. I haven't owned many sunglasses in my time, but I don't think they're supposed to break that easily.<br /><br />I'd feel bad giving these just one star, only because they look great with the matte black plastic and the reflective crimson lenses. But, sadly, I cannot recommend them to anyone due to the lack of durability.	2015-08-13

He already had them in black and red and he loves the new blue pair. He developed planters facetious terribly after we moved to Hawaii and he could hardly stand-up after sitting or laying for a period of time. After wearing these SOLE sandals, his feet are back to feeling normal again. Initially, I ordered him three other brands of orthotics sandals and he liked the SOLE brand best. I even ordered him a couple pairs of SOLE inserts for his work boots and his slippers. Now, I'm developing facetious in my feet, so I'm going to see if SOLE has any women's sandals I can order for myself!	2015-08-13

There seems to be a blue oil sheen on the lenses.  There is focus blur on the edge of lens if you turn your head or look out of the corner of your eye so you pretty much have to look directly ahead only.  I also have a cheaper pair of Foster Grant's model Dustin which have a plastic (CR-39? probably not.) lens and they are clear no matter which way you turn your head.  Pupil Distance (PD) of these glasses is 58.5 +- 1mm, and my eyes are a little further apart at around 64mm (close to average), so the Wally seems to be designed for people whose eyes are closer together than average, The Dustin model has a PD of 64 +-2mm and is nearly perfect, for me.  I give Foster Grant credit for marking the PD on their frames.  I wonder if the edge blur is related to the mismatch in PD between the glasses and my head?<br /><br />I will keep these Wally's in my jacket pocket, to put on, read small print, then take off, because the frames are nice, but will not be using them for reading books or the web.  I rate these just barely OK, not great lenses, Good Frames.  I guess they block the blue spectrum which is why I fell for them, but that's probably less important than the PD measurement, and the edge blur.	2015-08-13

I cant get over how cute they look on my feet! The arch support is phenomenal, much better than my older Reebok's. Being that these are training shoes, they are GREAT in the weight room. The first time I did squats in them I was amazed at how stable and supported I felt. The base around the ankle feels wide and sturdy so as you go down into a squat you don't feel like your feet are moving side to side. I have done a little bit of running but nothing longer than a mile. I don't think they would be good for long distance running. The flatness is great for doing weighted leg exercises and offers a lot of stability.	2015-08-13

Pleather with cute round toe box. like keens little brother	For 34 bucks, these are good shoes.  they feel just like the leather ones for twice the price.  They look better, if you have long feet you like to disguise in boxy toe boxes. (is that redundant?)  SO, they do have cute little boxy toes. They stick out from the arches and heel.<br /><br />I have terrible leg problems and must wear big orthotics and lifts on one side.  Thus I must cram an extra size or two into my shoes, rubbing on heels, bunions rubbing on toe box.  SO I know of what I speak here, shoebies!  If you have bunion that is painful to touch, get these or other thick leather shoes, not some thin mesh stuff.<br /><br />Orthotics: these do not have a lot of insole to pull out, it is quite thin.  Thus, you need to order up a size to fit your orthotic.  I ordered up two sizes from a 9 to an 11 (4 sizes?)  But I have a 1/4 inch lift under one orthotic.<br /><br />Heels: sliding a bit on the lifted side, but sole is getting more flex to it.  heels have nice height, though I prefer much more. For both feet.<br />Soles are TOO STIFF thus the heel slippage.  I will try flexing in my hand and such.  IF that does not work, I return them.  The other models I ordered, the &#34;trainers&#34; I believe the 633, are not so stiff, but I think someone wore them out for a day, as they stretch nicely.<br /><br />CAVEAT:  I have not yet worn these for a full day out, as I want to be able to return them possibly. Thus, my guess is I can wear them all day comfortably.  I wear boots all day also, though. might be the pain pills for my arthritis.	2015-08-13

The straps across the top of the foot were just a little loose, as I read in other reviews, but not loose enough that my feet went slipping around in the shoe. The underside (sole, right?) is a bit smooth and as a person who is naturally clumsy, I think I will need to step carefully in these. I bought them for a special occasion, but I can see myself wearing them again and again. I do like the colour a lot.	2015-08-13

I was looking for a pair of hot pink ballet flats, which are apparently not as common as I'd thought they'd be, when I came across these. I figured I'd give them a chance, and return them if they were awful. They fit as expected on me, and were more comfortable than I'd thought. They have no arch support or cushioning at all, so I wouldn't want to be walking a ton in them, but if you're mostly sitting, or on a dinner date, or wearing them to church, they're fine. The toes are a bit pointier than I'd really like, but not terribly so. They're kind of a suede-esque matte material, and the color is really bright hot neon pink. I have hot pink in my hair, so these looked really cute with a white sundress and denim jacket with pink accessories. The price was very good and I'm glad I bought them!	2015-08-13

Previous Tevas I had used this system for fitting, but there was a strap for putting the shoes on and off and to secure it.<br /><br />I could not get a good fit with the cord trying to put them on and off.  There was not enough stretch in the cord for me to get a tight fit and then just be able to slip them on and off.  Perhaps it will work well for some, but for me they were not keeping so I returned them.	2015-08-13

The shoes seemed to run smaller than anticipated and the elastic band was placed too close to the ankle - making for a very tight fit. My daughter couldn't even get her foot in one of the shoes.  It was difficult to tell right from left foot.  In my estimation, the order contained two right shoes. Unfortunately, I had to return them.	2015-08-13

The only complaint I have about this bag is that trimming of the handles of the bag are coming off. I've included 2 pictures to show what I am talking about. After using the bag for about a month, the trimming has all come off. My bag was constantly shedding; though annoying, it does not change the look of the bag.<br />The bag is a pretty color, durable leather throughout. The zipper to the attachment inside of the bag was broken, but I was not going to use it anyway.<br />Overall, the purse is high quality and I love the look!	2015-08-13

I purchased these in the Whiskey and once they arrived I had to have them in the Charcoal. A truly great purchase. I am not a fan of high heels so these fit the bill perfectly for me.

This bag is not only for shoes, but initially to conceal important items when traveling in Asia.<br />I have a safety back used for traveling, used for traveling to countries outside the United States.<br />The back pack has security zippers that allow restricted access to its contents.<br />But I didn't want to look like an obvious foreigner wearing a security bag. :)<br />This was nice enough to make my back pack look harmless and allot of people paid it no attention.<br />Of course, a professional probably would have noticed the difference, but this was also good for concealment.<br />Even if someone with sly hands decided go at one of my zippers in a crowded place, the bag acted like another deterrent.<br />But a shoe bag would never prevent someone desperate enough not to take ones valuables.<br />Now I just use both for holding sandy beach sandals after a day at the beach :)<br /><br />Update: 07.03.2016<br /><br />An interesting query about my review has prompted me to return to add additional details. To clarify why this bag only received 3 stars should have been written in the beginning. However it was one of my earlier and first reviews, and I was trying to focus on the positive aspects of the items I purchased. Because I'm not a paid reviewer, my intention is not to write a critical opinion or overwhelming lie. But to sum up why this bag only received 3 stars is this. It does not serve its purpose as a true shoe bag. I purchased a pair of shoes from Kohl's for a wedding reception about 2 years ago. Wore only once, so they were the perfect candidate for displaying the ineffectiveness of this shoe bag. My shoes are a size 13 with an 1-1/2&#34; heel with a 2-1/2&#34; raised back. Disregard the length of the shoe, and the height is still a problem. The bag could not fit both my shoes, and even 1 shoe was a tight fit. The only thing that fits in this bag are my beach shoes. 13&#34; in length but they can be fattened to nearly 2&#34;, they fit snugly inside this bag. However, a set of real shoes would barely fit if it's larger than a size 8 perhaps. I would not recommend purchasing this bag. Perhaps someone could find a good use for it, but in my personal unpaid unbiased opinion, it's not worth the investment.larger than a size 8 perhaps. I would not recommend purchasing this bag.

I bought these boots for their specifications and at was disappointed with my purchase. Not even one year later my boots are completely worn and in desperate need of replacement. Not even one month into use the toe of the boot began to show signs of wear and tear - not a big deal to me since I am usually busy. However, throughout the next few months  other items began to separate including the inner fabric lining and soles. If you work for a low call volume service, or do not work often, these boots may hold up longer for you. But for me, this is a major disappointment. I am switching back to Magnum which have held up in the city environment I used to work in.	2015-08-13

The stitching is real and very well done.  Love that you get two sets of laces to change the look a little. The length of the shoe like most Keds is a half-size long so keep that in mind. The biggest problem I had was with the width. These are definitely made for slender feet. Very disappointed with width. Had to return.	2015-08-13

These are really nice....the right color & style for sunglasses no matter what other reviewer said. I love them but there's just one little problem with them....the bifocal lens at the bottom of each lens is way too low so I have to look super low with my head up. It's actually straining for my eyes to be so low. I'll put some pads on the nose ridge to raise them a bit and see if that's better. I suppose they fit everyone differently so it might not work this way on people with longer faces....around the nose & eye area. I like them and won't make a big deal out of this little issue that can probably be tweaked.	2015-08-13

Good sunglasses especially at the price. Really pleasantly surprised by how light weight they are. I got the orange tinted lenses, they shade the world a pleasant light blue. The only downside is that due to the tinting as the tinting reaches the edges it switches from blue to reddish, I got used to it pretty quickly, but I can imagine how it might be annoying for others. They are very comfortable and sit well on my face.	2015-08-13

Every year I buy a new pair, and went with another pair last year. This year when they popped up in one of my Amazon e-mails, I went for it, and BOY! did I get a bargain! These boots are all over the place in pricing, but I put them in my cart for a day to think about it, and when I went back in, they were on sale for $59.99!!! Now THAT was a darn good price for Bear Paws, and I didn't want to wait to see if they got any lower just to get my feelings hurt when they went up above $100.00 again, so I hurried UP and bought them! I received them in RECORD time, about a day or two later, and they are everything I wanted and then some! I cannot WAIT to wear them! The reason I gave 4 stars instead of five, because I DO love them, is that you HAVE to size up! Thank goodness for the reviews, I took heed, and instead of my regular size 7, I got size 8, and am glad I did! So now I don't have to waste time and money sending them back for another size. They DO run small!	2015-08-13

I always love shoes from this brand. These sandals are soft, comfortable, and they fit me very nicely. I have wide feet (with bonny toes), and normally wear Franco Sarto sandals in size 6.5M and pumps in 7M-7.5M. I got this pair in size 6.5M (width: 3.5&#34;, length: 9.5&#34;). I liked how both the width and length fit me. I will say that these sandals fit true to size (to me). If you have narrow and slender feet, I'd recommend you to go about 1/2 size down. In addition to that, due to its wider foot-bed design, you might find that the shape of the toe  is not very flattering. But in my opinion, they are good for my feet!	2015-08-13

These were my first Altras and I had no expectations.<br />I put them on and started running. At first it felt like running on a cloud of air, very comfortable and soft. Since i ran on the streets, it was a nice change to feel that extra comfort the first couple of miles. However, by mile 6 on my first run, my toes felt a little discomfort, something i usually feel at a much later distance when running in Mizunos. I wondered why it was so soon on these?<br />So far, I've gone out once, and I really should try them out more often, but I love my Mizunos too much to give them up.	2015-08-13

Because of this, I was concerned with how they would wear. They were delivered on 3/13/15. Since my purchase, I didn't wear them for 1 1/2 months, due to a hip replacement. Unfortunately, between 3/13 and 8/13, most of the treads are almost completely gone.  The soles are not wearing unevenly, however, so that is a good thing. Because of my recent surgeries, I thought I would get another pair.  However, the price has increased from the $68.81 that I paid in March to $77.28 today (8/13/2015).  A 12% increase is more than I am willing to pay for a shoe that wears this quickly. They are very light, though.	2015-08-13

These give great support of the arch, ball and heel.  Fit a little snug with socks.  These do require a little more breaking in.  After first use during 12 hour shift, feet were a little sore from where the shoe rubbed around the toes (which is typical when breaking in new shoes sometimes), not from the arch, ball or heel.  I am certain that once I have broken these shoes in, this will go away.  Overall, they give the necessary support I needed for the long shifts on my feet.	2015-08-13

I own a few pairs of Stacy Adam's shoes in 8.5, and they fit perfectly. However, the inner lining/insert of this shoe is completely different from the rest. The Garrison has a lot more lift in the lining, so while it will look the same size as all of the other Stacy Adam's shoes, there is a LOT less room inside the shoe for your foot. Pretty much unwearable as an 8.5, which I'm returning with the hopes that a 9 wide will be a better fit.	2015-08-13

I have just discovered the See Kai Run brand and am totally in love with their shoes.  My 18 month old is a big guy and his feet have been described by some as &#34;Fred Flintstone Feet.&#34;  In having wide feet, it's been a struggle to find him cute shoes that fit well...until now!<br /><br />The quality of these shoes is top notch and you can tell that the company takes a lot of pride in their styling.  For being about a $50 dollar shoe they exceeded my expectations because he will only need 1-2 pairs per size.  The shoe is versatile and looks great whether my guy is in his playground best or dressing up for a night on the town.  The best part of these shoes is that my little guy LOVES them.  As soon as he opened the box, his face just lit up.  In the mornings he gets incredibly excited to put these on for school.  Normally, when I pick him up from daycare at the end of the day, he is ready to get his shoes off....well, that's not the case with these.  He seems content to keep them on his feet indefinitely.<br /><br />In terms of size, we just moved him into 7's and these fit perfect with a good amount of room to grow.  My son normally wears a stride rite extra wide, and the width on these is perfect for him.  If your child has regular to wide feet, I think you'd be happy with these shoes.  If you child has narrow feet, then these might not be right for you.	2015-08-13

I do not plan on running anything longer than a 5k in these, but purchased them for a upcoming backpacking trip in Europe where I plan to walk miles every day, and they were a great choice. After several weeks of heavy use, zero sign of wear, although I've been treating them well.  Very, very happy.<br /><br />The Blue/Neon Green shoe is very colorful and bright in person, but I don't mind it at all - it's a flashy color combo. The logo appears multiple times on the shoe, but the UA logo is simple so again, no problem there.	2015-08-13

They do require some breaking in, especially in the ankle area--they can rub a bit around the ankle bone, achilles, and on the part that covers the big toe.  Depending on the brand, I can usually wear an 8.5 or a 9.  I have these in a 39 and they fit the foot area just fine.  They smell a little weird when they first come out of the box, like plastic or chemicals. That smell has gone away in the past two days, out of the box. The wedge part is light weight enough, though visually obviously a plastic composite.  I like the tread on the sole--a little grippy, but not like a combat-boot. The color is a lighter brown than the photo looks on my computer, not as red/burgundy/brick.  I am happy enough with them and I think they will serve me well at work.	2015-08-13

I own 2 pairs of the New Balance WT610V3 and love them but they are discontinued.  This V4 version is very different.  The sole is not contoured at the arch and therefore does not have as much flexibility. The shoe feels flat and boxy to walk in which will not help with trail terrain.  Also, the shoe runs short and too wide - creative lacing does not help this issue. Please go back to your V3 version, New Balance.  I returned them and am now shopping other brands.	2015-08-13

They fit comfortably and true to size initially  but mine stretched out a bit o had suede and leather. I put heel grips in but my heels still lift out of the shoe. Like another reviewer said: the material on the base of the heel on the outside of the shoe wears pretty quickly. So they do look  beat up quickly from the back. I wore mine exploring Pompeii so in one day the heel was a bit trashed but I was walking on rocks and gravel. I really like the look of them. They clean up an outfit pretty easily. I purchased them again in black suede for $13.99. If you can get these for an excellent price they are worth it. They are not well made enough to warrant full price.	2015-08-13

The Aldo website has had complaints about the handle breaking off because it isn't reinforced well enough to handle the weight of the bag, but so far I haven't noticed any issues with that. If the blush holds up as well as the black I may order the tan one too!	2015-08-13

I am 5'9&#34; with a calf that measures 15 3/4 inches and the wide calf version fits great leaving plenty of  room for tucking in boot cuffs or jeans. The boots hit about 2 inches below my knee. My ankles are an average size and the boot doesn't seem too big in this area. I have the black and brown color and it is a bit more dressy than I had expected. I also like that they are lined and very soft. I had no issues with color fade like other reviewers had. Great boot especially at the price	2015-08-13

For those of us with plantar fasciitis who need significant arch support, the arches in these sandals really aren't quite enough. They are about half of what you get from Orthoheel/Vionic sandals. This is too bad, since I have found that quality and durability the Orthoheel/Vionic products has really declined, and I was hoping that these would be a more reasonably-priced alternative. I still wear them, but I'm careful not to do so for long periods, as I work very hard to avoid PF flare-ups.	2015-08-13

My daughter ordered it because she liked the design.  Right out of the package I could tell it was way way to small for anyone but a kindergartner.  1st grade tops.  It also felt flimsy and thin, plus the texture is pretty rough.  I don't think these will hold up for very long.  Then to top it all off, the first time I closed the zipper, very first time, it comes undone and no longer functions.  I would return it, but it's not worth my time.  I got what I paid for.  I wouldn't necessarily blame the seller as my product arrived on time, albeit a 3 week delivery since it's coming from China.  But this is a crappy item. Don't buy.	2015-08-13

They still fit a little snug over the top of my foot but I get a little bit of ankle slip (which your supposed to have).

So far this boot has been very solid. I've only taken these on shorter rucks, up to 8 miles, and they've been fine. They feel a little heavy at first but you get used to the weight. The break in process only took about a week.<br />As far as fit goes, I wear a size 11 in pretty much every running shoe and decided to order the same size in these boots. The fit was perfect for how I like ruck boots to fit. The width is fine (I have somewhat flat feet) and the length leaves me about half a inch, which is what I prefer.<br />The boots feel and look like they are very well made, and I would guess that they won't be needing a resole for a long time. Look forward to take these boots on longer rucks and through difficult terrain. I would definitely recommend these boots.	2015-08-13

I absolutely love these shoes. I bought them for my wedding so I won't know how long they last until that day. However, the base curves a little too much for my liking. I feel like I'm rocking when I tested them. I'd definitely have to practice around the house with them to get accustom. the 5 inches height also makes a huge difference since I'm no long accustom to wearing shoes that high. My feet is very narrow so there is a space at the side, but It's normal for me, most of my shoes fit like that. However, I love the make and I can't wait to wear them. I just hope I don't fall on the day. The shoe exceeded my expectation in terms of look and fit. In addition, I also wear a 6.5 but ordered a 6. It still fits.

Hard Believe Anything Still IS....	i love the comfort of SAS shoes and these sandals are no exception. i've had foot back hip you-name-it trouble and found SAS to be the best thing for them. i picked up these sandals this year in a store near me and from the moment i put them on they fit like a custom shoe. i walk between 2 and 5 miles per day (city walking) and my feet are as fresh when i return home as when i left the house. AND the shoes are attractive on my feet!. I have the tan ones, and think i'll order the black ones here (and by the way. i'm of retirement age) i almost forgot! the three straps all attach with velcro so its easy on every time by opening the back one. i have a bunion on my left foot that sometimes acts up, the velcro allows me to give just that little bit of extra room to make it all comfy again .. and taking them off ?- they just slip off without undoing anything (tho stay firmly in place while i walk). i guess that's it for now..	2015-08-13

IMPORTANT: THEY DON'T MAKE YOU AS MUCH $ AS MESSI!	I have been playing football all my life and thus have gone through several different boots over the years, finding it fairly difficult to find &#34;that boot.&#34; Football players will understand that it is difficult to find that boot that fits perfectly, feels right, and looks good. These boots do that. I have owned Puma, the King II and evoPOWER, Nike Mercurial, Hypervenom, and Superfly, and the Adidas F50's, none of these boots despite the price I paid for them fit like these, or had the touch like these.<br />They are light, fit INCREDIBLY comfortable, and are thin to the point that they feel as though they are part of your foot, and the ball is just on the edge of your bare feet. These boots truly are worth the money, I will buy another pair, and they definitely are completely worth the money. Great boots.	2015-08-13

Sorry for the lengthy critique, but it is worth it.<br />First of all, I am doing a lot of walking in tall grass in strong snake country (close to Abilene, Texas).  I wanted a boot that came up my leg as high as possible.<br />Lace-up boots- what I found was the lace up snake boots were extremely hard to take off, once you were finished wearing them.  It was more work taking them off than putting them on.  So I decided not to go the lace-up route.  Please keep reading.<br />Boots (cowboy style)- these were pretty good and eventually were my second choice.  But boots are stiff and can get uncomfortable after an extended period of time.  They certainly didn't have the removal issue as the lace-ups.<br />Snake boots with a ratchet lacing system (see Cabela's)- these were quick to lace-up and pull the knob on the back of the boot and the pressure of the laces is gone.  This type of boot was certainly in the purchase consideration.  More comfortable than the cowboy snake boots.<br />Irish Setter 2875- I tried these on at a local store just to see how they fit.  The store did not have my correct size so I had to try on a size larger.  I will tell you first of all these were the most lightweight, comfortable boots I tried on during the snake boot search.  It was like wearing very comfortable walking shoes.  The IS 2875 boots were very snug to my legs.  Now comes the real test.  When I unlaced the boots, pulled on the boot tongue, the boots came off without any extra effort.  I was sold on these boots.<br />After all my research into snake boots, here are the pros and cons of Irish Setter 2875.<br />Pros:<br />Easy on/very easy off<br />Lightweight - best of all boots I tried<br />Snug fit to legs, ankles, and feet<br />Very comfortable extended periods of wear<br />Feet/legs stay dry<br />Made by Red Wing (they do know how to make shoes)<br /><br />Cons:<br />This boot will not stop a prickly pear (cactus) thorn from penetrating to the foot.<br /><br />Two more things to add.<br />1) This product was not Prime eligible.  The shipper, 365 Outdoor Wear in Minnesota, provided free shipping and were extremely quick.  For all practical purposes, it was like a Prime shipment as the product was received in about three days.<br />2) For me, it is not a matter of if I ever get a rattlesnake strike to the boot, it is only a matter of when.  I will surely update the review when that strike comes.<br /><br />UPDATE:  5/17<br />Here it is approaching summer 2017.  The snakes are crawling and I put these on first thing in the morning and take them off at night.  You forget they are on.  Again, lightweight and very comfortable!! Your feet stay dry.  A few days ago I walked past a rattler and it alerted to me so the first strike was very close, but the snake boots were on and I felt protected.  So far I have killed three rattlers in the past four weeks and I have a lot of ground work around the trees to still do.<br /><br />As much as I have worn these there are no major signs of wear to the boots.  I will definitely buy another pair when the time is right.dd.<br />1) This product was not Prime eligible.

The shoes look very masculine on me and make my feet look a lot bigger than they actually are. The waterproof claim is accurate. They are very waterproof. I work in a kitchen with wet floors and water got all over the boots. They did not absorb the water. Overall I would give these boots a four out of five stars and would probably repurchase.	2015-08-13

I actually buy these shoes for myself as they're a great fit for women with small, narrow feet and they're a little bit cheaper than the adult version of this product. They have surprisingly good arch support and are very comfortable. So comfortable, in fact, that I've bought them three times in a row. They're waterproof through dew, pouring rain, and puddles. My only complaint is that the sole of the shoe wears away rather quickly for me. A pair lasts me on average about 6-8 months with walking about 1.5-2 miles/day on mostly concrete and mixed hard terrain. For a child/pre-teen, I think these shoes would be good and a growth spurt would end the life of this shoe before they could wear it out.	2015-08-13

They are light-weight and the water runs right through them.  They dry quickly.  I also wore them while driving 4.5 hours to get to the ocean and they were comfortable on land as well.	2015-08-13

I have plantar faciitis and it comes and goes depending if I see my dr or not.  These were recommended by my dr and they are worth every penny.  I've been wearing them for over a year now and they are pretty much the only shoes I wear.  They feel so good. So much so that when I wear a different shoe for a few hours and then put these back on I can really feel the arch and the support it provides.  I can walk all over the place in these.  All day at the zoo walking a lot and standing, my feet still feel good.  Only complaint I have is that being a flip flop my toes are unprotected from my kids stepping on them.  It's like a magnet. That's what you get for having a 7 and 5 year old.	2015-08-13

Not sure if the seller actually checks how these look before sending them out. My pair's straps were not even and ended up with a looser right foot strap.

I have flat, wide feet so when I see a medium &#34;B(M)&#34;, I tend to size up to an 8.5 or even a 9!  while a 9 is often times big for me length wise, it fits width wise, so if I like the shoe, I have to deal.  in this particular shoe I own the Prophecy 4, color: Turbulence/Black in a size 8 B(M).  I purchased an 8 B(M) in this shoe b/c I thought it would be the same, or similar to its older sister, the Mizuno Women's Wave Prophecy 2.  I own three pairs of Mizuno Women's Wave Prophecy 2 b/c my feet love them!  I own 8 B(M) in BOTH versions (Prophecy 4 & Prophecy 2).  however, size 8 B(M) in the Prophecy 2 is wide, even tho it's labeled as a medium.  a size 8 B(M) in the Prophecy 4 is, what I believe true to its size, and unfortunately, fairly tight on my wide, flat feet.  so my advice to you if you have wide feet like I do, size up.	2015-08-13

I'm rating this a one star because I ordered these for my 2 year old daughter thinking they had velcrow sides since that's what the description said but after I got the item I emailed the company to tell them these do not have velcrow and they said velcrow stops at size 5 for toddlers so be careful ordering this if you want them to easily go on bc there hard to get on without velcrow and the company was not very helpful to me.	2015-08-13

They used to have a little better fit.  I wear them 12-13 hours a day 4 days a week for work.  They don't hurt my feet and provide ok support.  I don't have any major foot issues though.  The thing I've come to realize is that they're just not worth the high price, which is why I buy whatever color is on sale.  They're not goretex so my feet are hot and sweat in them.  They're not waterproof.  They're not made in the USA.  This pair will be my last.	2015-08-13

Couple things; I spent less than $14.00 on this product but now the price has more than tripled so I'm assuming there was a pricing error in my favor, as for the support, these are definitely not thick soled walkers so if support is needed go a size up and add what you need. For my purpose these are fine, they are super light weight and I went up a half size to make sure there is enough room in the toe box. If you wear thick socks, go up a size or at least a half size. Back to the price, I personally would not spend $40 or $50 on these but given my $14.00 investment, I have no appreciable complaints, just watch size if you wear thick socks or need to add cushion!	2015-08-13

So say goodbye Nike and Hello New Balance.  Why only 4 Stars..?  I've been wearing them for about a month now and only time can tell if they last long enough to hit that 5 star rating.  ;)	2015-08-13

That adorable huge wallet that wouldn't fit in my old bag? It's practically swimming in this one. I love the quality of the material and stitching and I was thrilled that none of the zippers lead to fake pockets.

I found that I needed to go up a half size  to get the correct fit.  The shoes are well maid and look good.  Every foot is going to be different so adjusting the cleats at the bottome of the shoes is an easy process, but you might have to adjust the cleats, take a rid eand repeat a few times to get the cleats diled in for your foot.  Remember that this is in no way a negative towards the shoes, it s a fact whien you are using cleats.  The way the shoe ratchets the tab for shoe adjustment is different.  It took me a couple of trieds to figure out how to unbuckle the tabs, but once I figured it out, it is VERY simple to do.  I really like my shoes and would suggest anyone reading this review to purchase a pair and try them out.	2015-08-13

She needed black shoes for work, but wanted a little color to give them some flair. They're okay, but not high-quality shoes. Honestly, your feet are too important to make shoe decisions based solely on appearances.

These are my 4th pair of Sanuk, all of which have been amazing and incredibly comfortable on my feet.  They dont really provide any arch support, but these really arent meant for that.  They're great for chillin at home, walking around town, or even wearing to the office on a casual day.  One pair (the Hemp shoe) I own I ordered in a size 12 (what I normally wear) and the Sanuks fit a little too big.  Perfect in the toe area but they slip off the heel a bit.  Another pair I have is also a 12 but I wear with socks (the Motorboat sidwalk surfer) and they fit just right. The other 2 pair I have (the Vegabond and the Pickpocket) I got a size 11 in because of how stretchy the material is.  So the first couple days they are/were tight in the toe area but were like wearing a marshmallow wrapped in a cloud and topped off with unicorn hair.  Basically they are the best shoes I've ever owned.<br /><br /> I would recommend going down a size when you order these, unless you're at the higher end of your size (so if you wear a 12 or sometimes a 13 order a 12, but if you consistently wear a 12 then order an 11).  Or go to a store and try on a couple pair to see how they feel.  I perosnally like them to be a bit more snug.  Whatever makes your meat loaf!	2015-08-13

DETAILED REVIEW:<br />I bought the light blue ones, the color is just as pretty and clear as in the picture. They fit just fine, I chose the size I typically wear. As for width, I feel they are bit loose at the front, (I measured my foot..) my width is 3 and 1/2 and I feel they're a bit loose at the front, not uncomfortable at all and I don't mind in the slightest. Just in case any of you have doubts about the width and whatnot, go and measure if you wish!<br /><br /> I can wear them all day (thanks to the cushioning), though I have to point out that they're a bit heavy since they are platforms (you definitely can't run with these easily) and it takes some time (3 mins?) to get your feet into these and out of them too.<br /> The material is quite sturdy so the ankle part (high top) won't sag (?), if you have doubts about that...<br /><br />The first day I wore them, it was a bit uncomfortable at first 'cause I'm used to my other N*ke shoes that provide lots of flex/action and arch support but after a few hours I got used to them. These shoes are for looking good and not for strenuous activities; that's the #1 thing you should know about these, they're not your ordinary sneakers or Converse. These do not have ANY arch support (I expected/knew this when I bought these) and since they ARE cheap the rubber lines running on the sides of the soles seem as if they will come out of place with time (they weren't glued on properly)  it's fixable I think, nothing some strong glue can't fix.<br /><br />As for cleaning these, I'm not so sure. I used these for school one day, and it rained a lot; it was POURING. Imagine, I live on a tropical island so there was lots of mud wherever I walked, when I got home I cleaned them with handy wipes and they were just as clear as the first day I got them, so cleaning them with a scrub and some detergent/soap (whatever you use to clean shoes) can't be bad if you do it properly and gently.<br /><br />In all, you get what you pay for (maybe more), I've received many compliments, I love how they look on me, you will not regret buying these, and I am definitely gonna buy the yellow ones in the future. :-)<br />I wanted to make this review for those of you that are planning on buying these for everyday use, though, if you're planning on using these for a while or for less than 3 hours you should do just fine. I didn't give these 5 stars 'cause they're not super durable or high quality, obviously these will not last me more than a year and a half (maybe less), plus you have limited action, nonetheless I recommend these if you want some spice in your life. :-)	2015-08-13

After two plus years of constant wear my sharp toenails finally ripped out one of the thongs and I needed to find an exact replacement right away.

I wanted them since last year but they were all out by the time I was ready for sales. Well, based on the reviews I ordered correctly but the shaft circumference was 18&#34; not 16.5 and that is without any stretch. I wear a 9 wide so I ordered a 91/2 wide. the shoe part fit perfectly. I do wonder if it stretches because its man made not real leather. My calf size is 15.5&#34; so I thought 16.5 would be perfect for socks and pants. It swam on me. I measured it and the shaft circumference was 18&#34;. These go back. Too bad. They need some better quality control.	2015-08-13

I'm hoping that it simply needs to air out and that it'll be fine in a few days. I love the straps on it. The removable one is adjustable and very sturdy.

Plus, they wipe your glasses clean as you take them in & out of the case.  great idea - BUT - they are a bit short.  if you have really big glasses, they'll stretch out, but they'd be better if they were a tad bigger/wider/longer.	2015-08-13

I ordered 7 1/2, they are still ever-so-slightly too large, but it leaves room for inserts and bulky socks (should I need them).<br />The ankle support and arch support that these provide are astounding! I am the sales manager at a rent-to-own furniture/appliance/electronic store. I stand, walk around, move & lift furniture & appliances for 10-12 hrs a day and normally (even with expensive sneakers on) I am in agony by the end of the day.<br />I'm on day 5 of these, and my feet have never felt better. They aren't too heavy or bulky, and the steel toe has come in handy more times than I can count already (we are short staffed, so with no one to help, sometimes I will set furniture directly on my feet before I lift it, so as not to put so much pressure on my back by lifting directly off of the floor.)<br />My only grievance is how quickly they get scuffed. Within 2 days I already had scuff marks on them... but I also set things on them, and move things with them, so for me, scuffing is to be expected with any shoe.<br />I would 100% recommend purchasing these, and probably will again in the future. But trust the other reviewers when they tell you to order a size smaller.	2015-08-13

I think the boots are 11 but the inserts make them a 10.<br />I love the boots, leave them at the back door. I slip off my indoor shoes and slide my unsocked feet straight into the Kamiks and off I go straight into my farm chores. It's only 3 months of the year I need them when the temp drops to around 0-5C, the rest of the year they sit patiently waiting for winter. The liners barely lasted a winter, this winter they are pretty shot. This could be a result of my sockless use but I haven't had this issue with other brands. The liner lifespan has probably discouraged me from buying again. Boots: 5 stars, Liners:1	2015-08-13

This time I bought my daughter who is wearing about 7.5 the size 8 and it fits her perfectly but doesn't look like she would have any room to grow in it like her other pair so I ordered a bigger size. I bought an 8.5 and 9 and both were to big for her to wear right now. I had also bought the 8.5 for my niece who is an 8 narrow and its big for her at moment and the 8 was to small.  Little disappointed b/c size was spot on the first time we purchased the shoe but seems little inconsistent this time. Maybe  that's why the were on sale for 20$- they were size reject. '. The show is awesome just hope I can get the right size so I can get another couple of years out of them.	2015-08-13

I did use spray waterproofing to help keep water out and it worked well. They needed no break in at all for me and provide great arch support.<br /><br />Gave 4 stars because I love the comfort and fit, but only 4 stars because of the sole separation.	2015-08-13

Deliver Happy Feet Using Our Proven Arch Support Shoe Insert in most Mens/ Womens Shoes	Shoes	4	9	10	N	N	Works Good But Kind Of Pricy	I have flat feet (bilateral) and its always been a problem for me since I can remember. I can't stand as long, walk as far, run as hard. I use to work a retail job where I had to stand for a full 8 hour shift, and I would have significant pain in my lower calves and ankles. It would be a sore pain if I stand too long and then start to walk. Because I've always had this problem, I just got use to dealing with the pain. I don't like wearing tennis shoes which might offer more support, and choose to wear women's flats or ballet flats as they're sometimes called. That offers almost no support in addition to my flat feet, I am in daily pain.<br /><br />I looked into trying the Orthotics insoles because its specifically for flat feet! It never even occurred to me there was something on the market to address my issue, but in reality over 20-25% of the population have flat feet. I got the women's size 8-8.5 and they fit just fine in my flats (please note I also have wide feet). There is no gel so its all foam but it still offers great support, especially in the heel area. I don't think it absorbs as much shock as gel insoles do but one problem I have with gel insoles is they slip and slide in my shoe, and they tend to weigh me down. After a full day of being on my feet and running errands I saw a significant improvement in pain in my ankles, heel and lower calves. It definitely helps. My only concern would be the price. These are rather expensive for a pair of insoles. And although I think they do work, I'm not sure they warrant the huge price tag. They're not life changing. I would say if this is in your budget, then you can give it a try, but its not a cure all solution.<br /><br />(*I purchased this item with my own money at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion)	2015-08-13

I also noticed, due to the silky nature of the satin trim material, there is an occasional tendency for my heel/foot to slide over the side, even though there is a slight lip around the heel of the slipper.  If you have a narrow foot, look for a different style. Overall, the slippers are comfy, but I will look for a different Isotoner style next time.	2015-08-13

I was hoping to transition him out of the moccasins but he cried when I put anything else on him. These great little shoes have held up very well. They have withstood being in water, dirt, all day play of a 1 yr old with out any tears at the seems. The little monkey face got pretty dirty quickly but I wasnt worried about that. He is able to run in them and they don't trip him and most importantly they Stay on! They still fit even now but the elastic has gotten a little snug so I have to size up.	2015-08-13

I ordered a half size up and a WW (so 10WW). When I pulled them out of the box, my first reaction was, &#34;No way these are extra wide, or even wide&#34; I had to hunt inside the shoe for the size stamp to make sure they weren't boxed wrong. They slipped on easily enough, so I was optimistic, but after just sitting in them for 20 min, my feet were falling asleep! :( So sad because they are so cute. Just wanted to warn anyone else who may be hopeful about the WW sizing, it's maybe more like a regular wide version of a shoe that runs really narrow. I was tempted to keep them in hopes the leather would stretch out, but if it doesn't, I'd be out of luck and unable to return.	2015-08-13

I am soooo disappointed because I have been sifting through the internet the last 1.5 years looking for this shoe in this color and size and I dont know if these were damaged shoes prior that are now being re sold?

I did size up slightly to accommodate my duck feet in anticipation of problems if I did not.  I realize to soccer purists this gives me less than ideal ball control, but less control is worth having less PAIN.  I am a goalkeeper anyway, so ball control is not a huge factor for me as long as I can punt and goal kick with consistency and distance.  Diadora is generally more generous to us wide foot folks (thank God someone is), and these are as light as a feather...truly amazing.  My only complaint would be I wish the sole plate was wider so I don't feel like I am hanging over the sides so much.  I have found with synthetics I need a break-in period, warming up before each use to feel comfortable, which is the largest difference from my K-leather Diadora Maracana boots of the past.  All-in-all, excellent shoes for the somewhat wide-footed soccer player, and better than most options for me.	2015-08-13

Much narrower than other Keen designs.  I buy Keen because they have a generous toe area for my wide flat feet, and because they still use real leather, and this particular sandal had a leather footbed as well. I ended up having to buy a larger size because the 1st pair constrained my toes, but now after a few days of wearing the larger size, the leather has stretched some, and now I cannot tighten them sufficiently.  I'm disappointed. Perhaps I'll try the Alman next as it at least seems to have the usual Keen wide toe area.	2015-08-13

I wanted to get another pair before they stopped making this style as so often happens.  I am picky about flip-flops since in Hawaii that is all we wear.  My main problem with most pairs is that they don't fit snugly between the sole and the strap at the front, which makes the sole flop down in front when you walk.  This leads to tripping.  This style overcomes that problem and is quite comfortable all day long.	2015-08-13

The shoe fit perfectly, did not really need to get broken in, and is very comfortable.  My feet felt great during my initial runs.  The build quality is also excellent, and I am completely satisfied.  The ShoeFitr method of sizing may just revolutionize how to acquire footwear.  Highly recommended product and process.	2015-08-13

Not too tight or wide! Not the most comfortable area to place your foot on, but a highheel pad will fix that! The straps are a little hard to open/close. They sparkle beautifully! I noticed yellow glue though, but unless youre staring it could probably be looked past! Notice the material isn't pure white, it has a rainbow irredescent look. So next to pure white they don't match. ***I tried to return these shoes, but S&H for the least expensive method was $15.00, so if you're not sure, don't purchase them!!!***	2015-08-13

So far So Good! Like one of the other posts... the bag arrived without the key.

I'm tired of bags that don't stand up and flop over. It did have a funny smell inside, but i sprayed some perfume/cologne, and its ok. I use this bag primarily for work, it is big enough to fit my umbrella, ipad, and basic essentials. So far, it is a very nice bag and i am happy.

They seemed like they would've been perfect for what I needed. Something to transition my little guy from Robeez type moccasins to normal shoes. My only problem is that I have an above average 15month old who has clearly gone through yet another growth spurt, and when I got these on him (which was surprisingly easy being that they were way too small) they were just too tight in the toe area. His little toes were pushing out the front. I have a feeling if I had ordered them earlier he would've worn them til they were thread bare. I will definitely not make that mistake with my next little one!<br />*side note: My little guy is in 18-24 month clothing and the Robeez in that 18-24mo fit him but in a &#34;hard shoe&#34; like Stride Rite, he's a size 7, where according to their &#34;size chart&#34; he should be in a size 6.

I normally wear a size 9M or 9.5M. These Bear Paws labeled size 10 force my toes right to the end of the toe box. Width is a little snug but that is expected with shearling lining. They are well made just are not the length I expected. Walking in them is uncomfortable because I have to curl my toes to not have them jammed aginst the toe box. I have ordered a pair in size 11 because I like the quality that I see in them.<br />Edit: I received my size 11 boots and my bare feet swim in them. I need to wear heavy boot socks with them or else let them be loose. Upon further examination, the shearling fur in my size 10 boots  is about twice as thick as the shearling in the size 11 boots. So the shearling at the heel is pushing the toes into the front of the boot. The shearling will compress with use, I will try wearing the size 10s to see if they will work after a while in bare feet.	2015-08-13

I shopped and shopped to get these glasses.  Found the best price for authentic Ray Ban Aviators.  The exact pair I wanted.  Within 3 weeks, while wearing the glasses, one lens fell out, hit the ground and shattered.  I thought, no biggie, I'll send them to Ray Ban for repairs, which I have done several times for my now 12 year old Maui Jims.  I received a letter back from Ray Ban stating they could not be repaired because they aren't authentic Ray Bans. I am crushed. Of course they are not replaceable with the seller, Sunglass Mall. I am so very disappointed. I will never order from them again. So, I suppose I am out $117 and the cost to send the damaged glasses with insurance to Ray Ban. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030CGF86/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0	2015-08-13

It's got a beautiful silhouette and its heel is low enough for comfort, but high enough that my calves look great.	2015-08-13

I bought 2 other pairs from other brands in a size smaller (9) and they fit fine. These in a size 10 were so tight he can hardly fit in them. I have bought Pumas many times before and know they run a tad small to begin with but these are on the verge of a size defect. Decent shoe but get at least 2 sizes bigger then you would think	2015-08-13

I love Ralph Lauren shoes as I find the size and length are usually consistent with their sandals.

I bought them at the end of Sep 2014, and have worn them every day in the Fall, Spring and Summer. It is mid Aug 2015 now. So I'd say I wore them every single office day for 8 months (roughly 8 x 20 workdays = 160 days), and they are finally falling apart. They have taken a beating (grassy slopes, cobblestones, you name it), and I'm not disappointed with the run I've had with them. I came here to buy another pair. They are very comfortable, and I can run in them easily. Granted, I am short and am used to heels, although I prefer chunky heels with platforms like these for increased comfort. This was the TALLEST heel I could find that were comfortable and had a reasonable level of platform to reduce the total angle of my foot.  I pretty much run in these every other day because I'm always running late for the train. Because they're not wedges (space between heel and front allows flex & control), they are a lot more stable on uneven surfaces. If anything I'd say that there was a little too much play between my foot and the straps above, so my foot would slide down towards the front since the top didn't &#34;hold&#34; it in. Bring this sandal back so I can buy another.	2015-08-13

I have been wearing Princesses for the past 30 years (6 pairs now) and wouldn't have considered another brand or model due to their supreme comfort right out of the box.This combined with its sleek non-obtrusive appearance made me a loyal fan. My last pair looked worse for the wear so I was pleased to find they were still being sold. While this latest pair looks almost the same, the leather is not as supple, giving the shoe a more rigid feel and it doesn't provide the nice bounce in my step that I loved about the others. I feel the edges around the upper part of my feet which I find too distracting to wear for extended periods; previously I would wear them all day long without a thought. This new pair is collecting dust in my closet as I can not trade in the comfort of my old pair for the sake of aesthetics. It's a shame they've decided to lessen the quality despite raising their prices...this had been an extraordinary shoe.	2015-08-13

I wouldn't wear them for serious running, they are not the sturdiest shoe, but for casual exercise that wont beat them up they are probably fine, for noodling around they look good and whatever.  I have zig running shoes and I mean you can tell the difference in a quality shoe.  I plan to beat these up wear them to the gym  and probably just buy another pair when they wear out.	2015-08-13

It hardly looks spectacular, sturdy or feels solid, but it's an easy summer shoe. If someone looks down, they just might think you're wearing slippers! But...What did you want for this type of thing? It's made for running around the house, sitting on a deck or running out across the street to grab something. I sure wouldn't go on long walks with them--there's precious little support anywhere including the sole. The canvas is a bit rough on the back of the heel, but you eventually get used to that. They have limited uses, but the use they do have is just fine. I also get the charity link.<br /><br />There's not much else to say except this: in my experience, they tend to run a bit small in size from what I can see. I ordered a size that I would usually use for sneakers, which is typically 1/2 size larger than I use for shoes. The normal shoe size was way too tight. It's even a bit snug at my normal sneaker size.	2015-08-13

UPDATE- Bought them again, 2nd pair way too small	These are comfortable and warm, great for winter slippers. I wear them all year round, but your feet might get hot during summer days. Construction is fine, and the durability is good. I love having the rubber soles, and have no problem wearing them outside in most weather conditions. I was concerned that the tread would wear quickly, but it has lasted exceptionally well. In fact, the inside has worn faster than the tread. See other posts for sizing info. Mine fit as expected, but I read other reviews so knew what to expect. I might go one size bigger on my next pair (and they are good enough that I'd buy them again) as they are a tiny bit tight if I wear socks (which most times I don't)<br />UPDATE- Finally wore out my first pair wearing them every day for two years. Gladly ordered a second set. Size 11W (wide), got them and they say size 11, but they are about an inch shorter than my last pair (and every other shoe I own). Box says 11W, maybe someone put size 11W (woman) in the box? Returned them (vender was good to work with) but I don't know what I'll receive if I order another pair.	2015-08-13

I bought the black frames with smoked lenses and they look great.  I like the feel, the look, and comfort.  What I love the most is that they frame my face and wrap around my eyes so that I have a wider protection from sun glare and reflections.  As a result, they also protect from UVA and UVB rays. I'm amazed at how clear everything looks.  The sunshades are unisex and can be used for a casual, professional, and dressy look.  I purchased this pair of sunshades at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review, and the thoughts in this review are my own.	2015-08-13

I was going to return them, but as it turns out my son (also a tennis player) was in need of a new pair of court shoes, and he's a size smaller than me.  He reports that these Asics fit him fine.  The proof of the pudding:  We're pretty evenly matched, but wearing his new Asics, he beat me (I wore my old Saucony's, with the air bladder in the left shoe pierced ‚Äî so it makes a squawking sound when I walk).  Nike always fits true to size for me though, so I ordered a pair of Vapors.  When they come, we'll need to have a rematch...  My advice for Asics:  Adjust your shoe sizes one size down!	2015-08-13

However the fit leaves a lot to be desired. I'm a 7 and although the length seems to be fine, it feels a bit too narrow at the toes. The calve part just barely zipped around my legs- and I like to think I have normal sized calves! I've been breaking them in for 2 days now and the fit seems to be getting a bit better.	2015-08-13

The upper portion of the shoe is sewn to the sole, and you can feel the seam all they way around the inside of the shoe.  This is particularly annoying in the toe-box, as the seam is about a 1/2 inch away from the end of the shoe.

While I don't expect these shoes to last quite that long wearing them daily like I do, I'm pretty happy with them. Fit is good, sizing is accurate. Much lighter (yet probably not as warm and sturdy) compared to my old Bass boots. The sole like a sneaker, not like a thick boot sole. Comfortable, but not much in the way of support or cushioning. Also, the &#34;kaki&#34; color is more of a dark forest green and not as brown as the photo makes it seem. I like the greenish hue though.<br /><br />For the price I paid (~$28) it's an easy five stars. The normal price of $79 seems a bit much for what you get, but they are good shoes regardless and I would certainly buy replacements if they went on sale again. And yes, they do smell nice fresh out the box.	2015-08-13

Disappointed, though, because there's very little cushioning in the footbed.  It's very thin, and if you step over a pebble, you'll feel it.  I like the Varvatos version of the Chucks because there's a lot more cushioning in the footbed and they're a lot more comfortable than the regular Converse version, but with these sneakers, it's just the opposite.  If you're wearing them for looks, they're great.  But if you're actually planning to spend the day walking in them, not so great.  Also, these run a little small.  Normally, I take a 10.5, but in these I needed an 11.	2015-08-13

These sunglasses are awesome!  I love polarized glasses because I can see in the water when I'm fishing.  These glasses are very well made and have great lenses.  They fit me perfectly and stay on when we're flying across the lake in a boat.  They have a thick wire frame that will not break easily.  I have a bad habit of throwing my sunglasses in my purse and they always get scratched up. I have not gotten any scratches on these yet.  They come with a protective pouch to prevent this.  I would highly recommend these glasses to anyone.  I received a discounted product in exchange for my unbiased opinions.	2015-08-13

It's mostly lightweight because the materials are extremely cheap.  It looks okay on the outside-- it's suede-- but the interior is a really junky material, a slippery rough plastic-y feeling fabric that makes a little rustling noise when you're looking for something.  I don't care about this, so I like the purse.  It's divided into 2 halves inside, with a zippered center pocket dividing them.  This makes for 3 compartments total.  I usually put my phone in the middle zippered one so it won't get scratched, then wallet on one side, and keys on the other side. These fit with room to spare.  It's a great size if you don't want to carry much more than that on a daily basis, and it will fit more on the days that you do.  It would fit a small 16.9oz water bottle if you needed it to, although that would take up all of one side.  UPDATE - 10 MONTHS LATER:  This is my daily purse.  As small as it is, I have a hard time finding things in it, due to the inside lining being black-- you can't see what you're looking for.  For my next purse, I'll look for one with a light-colored lining.  Also, the hardware for the center pocket zipper broke, about 4 months in.  It slid right off.  9 months in, the lining started to tear away from the wall of the purse.  The outside still looks great.   All that being said-- what do you expect for such a low price?  I still don't regret buying it, although I would have if I'd paid more.	2015-08-13

The smell lasted about a day.you should buy an insole because these don't provide much support, especially for a big guy such as myself. I get a ton of complements from my coworkers. I work in a refrigated environment and the boots keep my feet toasty warm.the hold pretty well on brick and cement floors, but I tend to slide on tile floors. The floor is usually coated with beef fat and water, yet I very rarely slip. The black outer sole wears out quickly it started wearing out by the 2nd day, it will leave skid marks on the floor if you drag your feet so beware. Very stylish for going out as well.

I bought the 155s in black with the blue graduated lenses.  I've been wearing Revos since the 80s and have been having trouble with my 2yo pair losing lens retaining screws and finally craising in a lens.  My wife thought I need larger glasses and based on the reviews, I bought these.<br />I wear a 7 3/4s hat size and suppose I have a large head.  These glasses are wide and feel very comfortable.  I wish the temples were a bit longer so the curve would go over my ears, but these will do.  When I lean forward and shake my head, they stay on and don't move.<br />My wife's first comment was: &#34;It looks like you bought Jack Nicholson's sunglasses&#34;.  I good thing, I think.  Buy with confidence.  If they aren't right, they can easily be returned	2015-08-13

Disappointed how unbearable they were to wear though. Shoe has a runner toe and fits tight around the forefoot. Definitely was difficult to skate in them with the outside of your toes are in pain. The lining inside of the heel is a scratchy mesh that left a blister on heel so you have to wear thick, long socks. The airbag in the heel is decent sized which adds weight to the shoe. The sole is thick so not much boardfeel. The flick is also not great too. Grip was okay though. This is probably more of a collector's item than a usable shoe as I can't imagine how someone could use this shoe for skateboarding.	2015-08-13

I upgraded to the Newport H2 from the Whisperer, and I'm so glad I did! I also went up half a size (I'm between 9 and 9.5; I bought this in 9.5) This style seems to stay on better and doesn't allow as many pebbles or rocks to get in when I wear them.<br /><br />The toe protection is great and the perfect amount.

I had been to 2 podiatrist  and had 2 different orthodics made.  I worked 12 hr shifts as a nurse.  After 4-5 YEARS, I visited a Birkenstock shoe store in my area and was fitted with a cork insert.  THAT saved my life!  (well...)  My fasciaitis pain was relieved over time--a few months--and I have continued to wear Birkenstock cork inserts in my work/walking shoes and sandles (&#34;Birkies&#34;, plastic thong) for many years.  However,  the Birkies plastic thong sandles were discontinued about 3+ yrs ago.  The pair I am wearing are completely worn out on the bottom which makes them unsafe on wet surfaces.  But anything else I try, makes the fasciaitis come back!  So I tried this product.  They are so uncomfortable between the toes and they look ugly.  That is my biggest complaint with the Birkenstock products-they are just so ugly!  The black plastic thong sandles I wear look like normal sandals!	2015-08-13

So I've decided to use them just around the home and outside including in wet conditions as they should be able to withstand moisture given the above, also the three points where the straps attach to the sole are not glued, rather they have bungs under the sole holding them together. Regardless, they were comfortable from day one. Possibly they could become a little loose with longer term wear. I would not want to wear them on a long walk though. I guess I shouldn't have expected leather for US$14, though they are a reasonably good looking pair of flip flops for the price, with nice metallic detailing.	2015-08-13

I loved the old ones with one exception.  The interior stitching behind the heel came apart after about 6 months.  The separated seem did not affect comfort or any other aspect of wear so I kept wearing them for 3 years or so.  These shoes look like they may have solved the weak stitching problem in my older shoes.  However, the newer design makes them significantly harder to slip on and off.  One of the main uses for the older Chameleons was to wear through airports (I travel a lot).  The ability to easily slip them on and off made passing through security less of a pain.  I do not see the newer ones offering the same level of convenience.  The new shoes are also narrower than the older models.  In the past I have ordered Merrell's a 1/2 size smaller than other makes.  Due to the newer shoes narrower fit I would consider ordering a half size larger than usual.	2015-08-13

My experience is: Asics shoes can not be beat for motion control and shock absorption.  Waiting on exchanged ones in larger size.   Replacement arrived.  After wearing for several days I was disappointed to find that this is not the &#34;motion control&#34; shoe that I need.  Asics does not claim it to be such and my expectation was based on faulty information from third party research.  Ascis.com accurately describes the shoe's characteristics.  I find it to be soft (giving) to the heel strike, which is certainly good and what I think most people want.	2015-08-13

I actually bought three pairs in different colors (purple/black, white/lime, grey/coral) - one for work travel, one for home, and one for when these wear out. They are light, breathable, and oh so comfy. I use them as true cross trainers for running and weights. Like most gym shoes, you should size up by a half size (I'm a 9 in other shoes, and 9.5 in all trainers).

As a side note	Ordered the little kids 9-10 for our son, and the length was right (he's around a size 9) but he couldn't actually fit his foot all the way in because the straps were so thick. He is of average size and weight, but he does have wide feet, so probably a kid with narrower feet would've been fine.<br /><br />As a side note, I originally ordered the 'slim' version of these (which I think is the 'girl' version, based on the color options) in the same size, and though he didn't like the color, they actually fit his feet! The strap was slightly slimmer, and so he had a bit more room to slide his foot in.	2015-08-13

I'd actually ordered others that were supposed to be great and would up with ill fitting and poorly made items. I saw these for a pretty reasonable price and decided to try them. When they came I was a little skeptical. They seemed to be like many of the others, but after wearing them for about a week I've really come to like them.<br /><br />Like many slippers you can buy today, these have a memory foam sole. All too often the sole just kind of flattens after a few hours of wear and you're left with a flat and uncomfortable sock. Not true with these. The sole actually stays somewhat firm and cushy - amazing! It also seems to conform to your foot and becomes a bit more comfortable with wear. These are also warm and will be nice when winter comes. I haven't washed them, but the tags say they can be, and they look like they will hold up too the washing machine.<br /><br />As far as size goes, I wear a 9 and I bought the 9 and it fits perfectly. There is a little slip in the heel, so if your an 8.5 you might want to size down. I almost bought a size smaller based on the reviews, and I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />Overall, these are nice and comfortable and should last a while.	2015-08-13

I love all of my other Vionic/Orthaheel footwear, so I was excited to try a pair of heeled boots.

I soldiered on, thinking maybe I could live with it for a date night-type situation...except the heel slipped with each step (not just rubbed, but actually came up off the shoe bed by 1/4-1/2&#34;)! I bought my true Vionic size and the slippage was just enough that it was really annoying and I'd probably end up with blisters.<br /><br />So, honestly, I'm glad they slipped too much for my liking, because I might have been tempted to keep them even with my toes feeling a bit squished.<br /><br />C	2015-08-13

I carefully read the reviews before I made my purchase since sending them back internationally would have been a hassle for $10 shoes. I bought the 7.5 in the black pu instead of my usual 8 after reading some of the reviews how these run big. I have medium width feet, neither wide or narrow. The 7.5 was super snug and isn't going to stretch especially since it's synthetic. I have no choice but to keep it and will perhaps order the 8 in the future. As for the aesthetic quality, it's a very basic pair of flats: no heel, no arch support,  not much comfort.  Just something to run around in.	2015-08-13

Not the prettiest shoe in the closet, but most certainly one of the most comfortable, even without inserts.

Waterproof, Comfortable, Stylish, Lightweight, Awesome	I normally wear a 10.5 when I received them , I did have to return them for a smaller size. I went to a 10 was afraid the 9.5 would be too small. I work construction constantly walking on concrete slabs, ladders and atop 2x4 walls. I used to look forward to taking off boots at the end of the day. Not with these, they are BY FAR the most comfortable work boot I've ever worn. Also you step in concrete or drywall mud and just hose them off. NO probs. I can also stand in 3-4 inches of water without getting my socks wet ! I will never buy another brand again, EVER ! I have been wearing them almost every day for about a year now, plenty of tred left on them still. Also, they are very lightweight, feels like wearing a pair of skate shoes	2015-08-13

But...<br /><br />I bought a new pair for my daughter this summer, when the shoes arrived, one shoe is much smaller than the other one, weird! So we got a replacement one (thanks for that). But the replaced pair show the same problem.<br /><br />After my daughter wear these Crocs to a trip (no different than any other trips we had), most weird thing happen again - the right shoe shrink. When you wear the shoes, you definitely can feel the right shoe is MUCH tighter. I want to show you the pictures<br />Pic 1: they both are size 7<br />Pic 2: bottom of the shoes lined up to tile on the floor<br />Pic 3: The right shoe is much smaller<br /><br />It has past the return time frame, that's a shame. The reason I post this review is to help Crocs to figure out what manufacture process/material had changed that might had caused this problem.<br /><br />Until we know this quality problem is addressed, it's going to be hard (personally) to trust the brand and purchase another pair.	2015-08-13

These glasses are perfect for me.  I have somewhat of a smaller face and the glases fit me perfectly.  I love that the bridge for the nose does not have ridges that leave a mark on my nose when I take them off.  Another reason for that is that they are very light-weight, yet strong.  They also do not move off of the bridge of my nose.  I love the fact that they stay in place even if I move.  I bought a pair for the car and a pair for my house when I go outside.  They are definitely polarized and you can see the difference when you go outside.  The colors are crisp and clear.  Great buy for those that want quality glasses without killing your bank account.	2015-08-13

They were are continue to be my favorite heels.  Practical, dressy, casual, they are classics that I hope never stop being manufactured!  I'm always hunting for them on ebay....  These particular heels fall into that same category.  Not as pointy-toed as I prefer, but still very pretty and dressy for work or play.  The comfort level is high and these are all day heels.  You can't beat amazon's price, either.  The only drawback this time is that they are wickedly off-gassing like no other shoe I've ever owned....  I left the shoebox open in my room and a while later, the entire room smelled like fertilizer.....yuk.  Unless they stop stinking within the return period, they're going back.  Honestly, going to a professional meeting or to Court and everyone's wondering what that smell is?  I don't think so.  Hence 3 out of 5 stars.	2015-08-13

When I got these shoes and started running in them I also felt something odd but did not think much of it, thinking it is just the shoe and since it did not immediately feel uncomfortable I decided to keep at it. I like the appearance of the shoe and ASICS are supposed to be a good running shoe, so I wanted to give it a chance. After running in them about 4-5 times a week for a few months as well as doing some uphill sprints, I began developing some kind of foot pain around the heal area which until now (over a year later) I feel like I am still recovering from. Discomfort under the heel could be felt, but the big problem was at the Achilles insertion point. A few people suggested to try new shoes, I should have listened earlier. I feel like there is something not right with this shoe, just as others have pointed out in other reviews. I don't think there is enough support around the heal area, and the foot bed or sole of the shoe under the heal is odd. Maybe its me, and a few others who experienced the same, I don't know.	2015-08-13

This shoe style just WORKS for me, so I have bought this shoe in every color available.  Having lost a few inches of height as I grew older, I need to wear heels when I teach my college students, and just those extra 3+ inches help.  I cannot wear big tall spiky heels--- those are for women too young to know better.  But the little 2&#34; heels don't do the job well enough to count.  What I need is a platform that is both high enough and stable enough to make me feel at ease wearing it, and this platform sandal works.  My foot is wide and square -- almost no slope from large toe to small one--so a shoe that is too pointed ends up being a killer.  This one has a nice shape to it, but it does not literally squash my toes together.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in many more colors!	2015-08-13

I love the look.  The cost was more than I usually spend on myself.  I finally decided that I would buy a pair, I looked in the stores and there were no stores that carried a wide width.  I buy wide on a regular basis.  When I received my shoes that I ordered on line, I tried them on.  They seemed a little roomy especially the right heel.  After wearing them they stretched even more until they are sliding off my feet when I walk.  Because they have been worn I cannot return them and wouldn't know what size to order as I always wear wide width.  I have paid a lot of money for something that I will need to stuff with something in order to even wear them.  Therefore, I am very disappointed. The shoe is great looking and if there are any suggestions on how to make them fit better, I would very much appreciate them.	2015-08-13

These shoes have been a life saver before & after my foot surgery.  The stretchy fabric top is perfect for my recovery by not putting unnecessary pressure on my surgery point (top of big toe joint).  The memory foam soles are very comfortable.  However, they do not provide the firm arch support my Nike tennis shoes do for all day activity & wear (which I'm unable to wear at this time).  I find at the end of the day, the bottom of my feet ache from lack of firm arch support when I've been fairly active.  A comfortable shoe by all accounts (I currently own 3 pairs of these) I highly recommend.	2015-08-13

Just didn't feel right when I tried them on.  My big toes turn up slightly and were hitting the toe box.  These shoes have little structure, which makes them lightweight, but I'm used to a little more shoe.  Didn't seem to have as soft a cushion as my other Asics gel Phoenix (can't find anymore, may have been made for a particular retailer).  I did not try a run in these, so possibly prejudged.  I also prefer a sole that's wider in the forefoot and heel than these.  Returned for refund - still shopping.  (I'm 5'10&#34;, 145 lb, run 12-16 mi/wk at an 8:30 to 9:00 min. pace.

I have just discovered the See Kai Run brand and am totally in love with their shoes.  My 18 month old is a big guy and his feet have been described by some as &#34;Fred Flintstone Feet.&#34;  In having wide feet, it's been a struggle to find him cute shoes that fit well...until now!<br /><br />The quality of these shoes is top notch and you can tell that the company takes a lot of pride in their styling.  For being about a $50 dollar shoe they exceeded my expectations because he will only need 1-2 pairs per size.  The shoe is versatile and looks great whether my guy is in his playground best or dressing up for a night on the town.  The best part of these shoes is that my little guy LOVES them.  As soon as he opened the box, his face just lit up.  In the mornings he gets incredibly excited to put these on for school.  Normally, when I pick him up from daycare at the end of the day, he is ready to get his shoes off....well, that's not the case with these.  He seems content to keep them on his feet indefinitely.<br /><br />In terms of size, we just moved him into 7's and these fit perfect with a good amount of room to grow.  My son normally wears a stride rite extra wide, and the width on these is perfect for him.  If your child has regular to wide feet, I think you'd be happy with these shoes.  If you child has narrow feet, then these might not be right for you.	2015-08-13

They had the look and style I wanted but after using them in the gym for a couple of weeks...I found out they were FANTASTIC for working out. Light weight, ultra comfortable, just the right amount of support and they look killer too. They do run a little big so the next pair that I'm already looking at purchasing will be a half size smaller.	2015-08-13

They look great and were so comfortable that I bought a couple of more pairs (black & blue-also great looking) from another online discounter.  A podiatrist told me I have low arches & these shoes have just the right support for me.  I'm overweight with neuropathy (and super sensitivity) in my feet, and it was worth it to me to have backups of these at a great price.  I did put in a pair of my favorite insoles for added comfort.  The insoles that came with the shoes aren't fancy, but are pretty cushy & those with less fussy feet than mine might even be happy with them.  I'm age 66, not a runner & am using these shoes for everyday & the black & blues for more dressy occasions.	2015-08-13

With my large collection of cheap $15 faux leather boots that are used and abused on a daily basis through sun, rain, and snow, a pair of $80+ quality boots would feel even better than my comfortable BRECKELLES lace up booties, right?<br /><br />Well...<br /><br />Okay, so let's start with the look. They're super cute, but sophisticated and the heel adds that extra touch of scholarly class. The feel of the material is very nice (I'm avoiding anything too suede or too shiny), and it's been good around water and such. They do scuff pretty easily, which I wouldn't have mind as much of these had been my throwaway shoes that I got for $10.<br /><br />As for the fit, I was a bit let down. My feet are shaped funny so they're narrow in some places and wide in others. I can usually get away with a regular fit with some lace readjustments and a clever use of insoles. This boot fit everywhere just fine (I wear a 6 and ordered a 6 after a 6.5 was way too big) except for a slightly too snug fit at the sides of my big and little toes. After just a few hours of walking, my feet were already hurting and there were blisters when I got home; and this is coming from the girl who can comfortably run in 4in heels all day. My hope is that with a little bit more time and use to break these in, they will become my new favorite pair of shoes.<br /><br />All in all, it's a cute pair of lace up leather booties. They're not as comfortable as I hoped they'd be for the money I threw in for them, but I'm hoping they can be broken in further and it's just a case of &#34;gets better the longer you use it&#34;. I bought these with a gift card so I technically didn't spend much on them, but having wanted these before having acquired the card, I must say I'm a little dissatisfied.	2015-08-13

After reading other reviews saying these boots run small I ordered a size 11 (I usually like my boots a size 10 for room for thick socks).

The footbed has just a little give that makes it more comfortable than the original.  Over time I am sure the latex in the footbed will flatten and it will be even more comfortable.  The oiled leather upper gives it a high end finish that looks quite nice and understated.  I have worn these sandals every day since I received them and will enjoy many years of wear.	2015-08-13

I ordered these after my daughter bought a pair and talked about how much she liked them.  I was going to camp for a week and had them delivered to the camp.

The tread is excellent for all-terrain hiking and the arch support is great. However I can't believe that no one else has noted how big these run. I'm a solid 8.5, and often athletic shoes are a little tight in that size since they tend to run small. These are just the opposite. They run both long and wide, as well as tall (which works though because I have a high dorsal). My feet are sliding around in them, even with thick cotton socks. I'm going to try wool socks and see if it's any better. Since no one else has commented on this, perhaps I just received a defective pair. Otherwise they seem like a solid, well-made shoe.	2015-08-13

NOTE: I have NOT purchased these, HOWEVER I have a pertinent (I believe) observation about these reviews.  My GUESS is there MAY be a recent issue - because older reviews are mostly positive and recent reviews (last couple of months) are mostly negative.  I share this and suggest you look at positive and negative reviews and make the decision yourself.  (I find this helpful w/ any product actually - as sometimes the manufacture may change (or they may source it from someone different  - and the product itself, may improve or devolve).

Shoe is not what was expected. The sizing was at least two sizes too small. The calf was extremely (not average...but EXTREMELY) too small.

When I put them on , they fit quite well- straps were a little snug but I figure they'll loosen up with time.

Probably because of the pull of the elastic but I found myself constantly stopping to adjust it or walking very awkwardly to try to not let it happen.<br /><br />They are cute and not a bad deal for the price, but I can't get past the way the shoe turns so it isn't totally underneath my foot.	2015-08-13

Great for playing outside or running around the city all day.  Can also be easily cleaned with a baby wipe or paper towel.	2015-08-13

However we have another pair of Crocs that are 10-11 size that fit him perfect. I Originally ordered these in 10-11 but those were too small for him so we exchanged for 12-13 size. Those fit better but are a little too large. Shoe size normally can be tough online but buying same brand/same look shoe i was hoping the sizes would match up.<br /><br />He will grow into them eventually but besides the size issue, the quality/look of the shoes are fantastic.	2015-08-13

I usually wear a 12 in most shoes and the 46/12-12.5 fit like a glove. Will be heading to the range tomorrow for the first stab at performance. The build quality is first rate and they have nice arch support. Only reason for 4 stars is they have yet to reduce my handicap :) But I can no longer blame that on my shoes. Not that I did. But you gotta blame something other than your crappy swing. Right? I will report back on the endurance of the tread after a week playing desert golf with a partner who has a tendency to hit balls in to the scrabble.

I am a nurse and spend 12 hours on my feet. I have tried every shoe out there. These are pretty good. I have arthritis in my feet so the wider style is much more comfortable for me. I also like the wide base as I am quite clumsy and tend to turn my ankle in Danskos. Not great arch support, but I don't need it. The size was right on for me with compression stockings. If you want to wear thicker socks, buy a larger size. Love the mary jane style. Not quite as cushiony as I would like, but I do like them.	2015-08-13

I have a pair of Keen casual shoes that I liked so much I wanted to give their work boots a try. I work outside constantly in the rain, snow mud running jack hammers, concrete saws, sewer augers and jetters, chainsaws to every piece of small landscaping equipment to large tractors.<br /><br />These boots lasted 9 months before I decided to reach out to Keen about problems with the boots.<br /><br />Problems with these boots<br />1. They slowly leak water after 3 months.<br />2. The toe guard glue is failing and they were falling off. I reglued them.<br />3. The insoles are destroyed, I'm 5'10&#34; 190 lbs.<br /><br />I contacted Keen about the insole problem to see if they would send me some new ones under their 1 year warranty. They will not and told me to go buy some.  Their warranty only covers manufacturer's defects, not comfort and fit.<br /><br /> I think insoles that fail in completely in 9 months are a manufacturer defect( Thanks Keen rep Ashley). They do not and I am officially done with Keen. For the price of these boots you can get yourself into some Danner's or Georgia Boots and they will replace anything that goes wrong with their boots.<br /><br />I am going to post a video of sending this boots up in flames once we get some rain.	2015-08-13

Mine had some sticky residue on the exterior top of the tongue portion that was easily wiped off.  The exterior material is soft and supple polyurethane leather.  These are quite light for the 'chunk'. The length of the shoes are right, but these are a bit narrow.  I have never had any width problems with my other shoes.  I would not recommend these for long walks.  Edit: I've been wearing these almost daily for about 3 months.  The lining on the bottom of the shoes have slid toward the top of the shoes.  I am going to go buy some cheap thin liner.	2015-08-13

They are totally 80s which is alright with me. That was one of the most outrages fashion decades. But these are not over the top fashion they are just a little out of the &#34;norm&#34; as far as shape, size and even design. But that is the type of things I look for something different.  The zebra print is not stickers  it is painted on so it's on there for good. It will not peel or rub off with wear.<br />They are very comfortable to wear and the lenses although they are not black, are plenty dark enough. If my sunglasses are not dark enough I get headaches so that's important to me.<br />The handles don't dig into my ears and the glasses fit well enough not to fall off while I'm moving my head. I never get tired of trying new stylish sunglasses and will get a lot of use out of these.<br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.	2015-08-13

Also impressed by the fast shipping to Canada by Amazon :)  I ordered them on a Friday, and they arrived yesterday (Wednesday) - so two days for processing and two days for shipping, great! I tried them on with bare legs and I had no socks on, and they fit exactly as they should so I can imagine with socks and leggings they will be perfectly snug (the way I like) and loosen up slightly over time, being that they're leather.  They have perfect arch support, are a great height for me (I am 5'2 - petite), and I have slim but athletic calves.  The elastic on the back will allow for that nice amount of stretch once I have socks and pants on with them. Overall I am more than impressed with my purchase and the price I paid.  I know I will have these boots for years to come and now I am set for fall & winter here - can't wait!!  :)  I highly recommend - thanks Amazon!	2015-08-13

Shoes are a little large than your standard size but if you wear thicker socks or two thin ones than it fits. Wearing the shoes for 8 hours straight is comfortable enough as caterpillar shoes are wider at the toes so your feet don't pinch. The reason I gave it a four star is I started getting sand in through the top were the laces meet in one of the shoes and that sand accumulated between the linings so there was no way of emptying it. (I was working at a construction site) On closer inspection I found there was a small hole on that shoe. I used some glue to fix that and it was all right. Working in wet weather conditions the shoes performed well and kept my feet dry.	2015-08-13

They make me the coolest kid in my 5 am crossfit classes. I have an ankle injury with both ankles, so the high tops on these shoes are perfect to help protecting my ankles, and they are totally flat on the inside, which is perfect for lifting all sorts of weights. They are meant for lifting weights, so you're not going to have a great time running in these shoes. They are also very wide, which I like for my wider feet, but I'm not sure everybody would appreciate the wideness like I do. Once these wear out (which probably wont be for a while, they're very well made for $35 shoes), I'll likely purchase another pair of these.	2015-08-13

Hello!<br />Doc Mart pair number seven for me, and I must say that despite the excellent look of these boots. . . .well they kind of just plain suck.<br /><br />Reasons they suck:<br /><br />Break in: I understand that docs take a long time to break in, but wow. These were about the most horrific and painful boot I ever owned for about three months. I did all the classic things we used to do to break in combat boots when I was in the army, (oil, shower in them, beat them to a pulp) and nothing but time and pain seemed to do the job. Before you go off on how they probably didn't fit proper. . . .no. No they definitely fit very well.<br />To emphasize how hard the leather was on these boots, understand that after 4 months of owning them, I still didn't want to wear them on a cross country motorcycle trip.<br />Needless to say, eventually they got pretty comfy.<br /><br />Looks: they look sharp, however, it is very easy to tell that they were assembled out of patchwork leather. My toes are two completely different colours. COMPLETELY. Like night and day.<br />Pretty cool, Doc.<br /><br />Quality quality quality:<br /><br />This is where things get nice; I was in my driveway destroying something ransom and discovered something under my bum that I was sitting on. What was it you ask? Oh, nothing more than the heel of my boot! Just decided to spontaneously fall off.<br />They went for some sort of stacked leather idea on the soles, but went the air cushion route they always do, yet in the process sewed the front of the boot on (good idea, thank you, common practice and sense) but glued the back portion on, using some sort of quality of glue you used to eat as a child.<br />So yeah. . .that happened.<br /><br />They've been gluing together under 5 C Clamps in my garage for the last 24 hours.<br /><br />If this is a reflection of your quality, I feel as though you should drop the doctorate portion of your name. For shame.	2015-08-13

So I bought this pair to replace those two. These are nice - fit well, comfortable and I can walk in them for a long time. The challenge is in the zipper. Pulling it up when they're off is pretty easy, but pulling it up when they're on is a struggle.<br /><br />My previous Merrell's lost the zipper pull on one shoe (both pairs). I was hoping that they would have figured out this flaw and was pleased to see a bigger pull. But with the effort it takes to zip them, I'm concerned that I'll lose this pull, too.<br /><br />Now, I am KEEPING them - because they're comfortable and I'll wear them a lot. However, will likely use them as slide ons so I don't have to fight with zipping them (note: I am *strong* - this isn't a weakling thing - they are just that challenging). If you have any challenges with strength, go with another choice from Merrell.	2015-08-13

For way too long, I have struggled to find a sandal that has the right width to deal with an overlapping toe issue I have (probably caused by various narrow width sandals I have worn over the years).  With Chaco Sandals my search is finally over.  The  Yampas (wide size) fit perfectly both in length and width.  Much to my surprise, the straps do not bother my feet at all.  Thankfully, the straps cross over my foot BEHIND my small toe, not on top of it.  Also, I have a mild to medium arch.  The arch of the Yampa is mildly stated.  As a result, the arch has been very comfortable for me.  The sandal is a true winner.	2015-08-13

They are phenomenal.  I have a problem with one of my feet due to three surgeries performed to remove bunions and that foot now has issues. Because of this, I mainly wear closed toe shoes that have support.  Fit Flops provide me with the stability and comfort that I need.  I own them in red, black, navy, pewter, suede forest green and tan.  I love them  It takes awhile to get use to wearing them, if you have never worn them before,  because the wobble board technology used in the shoe definitely  provides a different strut reality for you.  I take them to the park walking and honestly, I feel that  they are a better workout than my Puma workout shoes, with which I alternate. They force your stride differently than you would  normally be use to.  You would have to walk with them to see what I mean. I can't say enough about their benefits to my foot comfort except that I'm glad that I discovered them.	2015-08-13

These are pretty comfortable though I don't think I could wear them if I were doing a lot of walking for a long period of time.  There is no arch support and the sole is very thin.  Great for small walks, shopping, etc.  They are stylish and pretty and I get a lot of compliments on them.  I bought a size 9 which is what I typically wear in a sandal and it fits great.  I opted for the Smokey Grey color and like how they go with pretty much any color I wear.  I should add that I do not have a wide foot and these sandals are just about perfect for the width of my feet.  If you have a wider foot, these may not work for you.  These do not work well when wet. I walked through some grass where the sprinklers had been on and my feet were slipping all over the place.	2015-08-13

I bought these so I could wear sandals all day, but still have good support for my back and a stronger shoe that lasts, especially if it gets wet.

You cannot beat that price!!! As i can see may people has received sunglasses made in china or they are not sure if they are authentic. If you had aviators before you can never miss a fakes or a defective ones. Although mine are made in italy and i got ORB3025 112/4L58 blue mirror polarized for my girlfriend which are also made in italy. Both pairs are 100% authentic. If you want to pay 200$ just to be sure that they are authentic go for it and purchase the sunglasses from Rayban.com but once you find out that these are as much authentic as the ones from rayban you will want to save those 80$ because these 2 pairs cost 400$ on rayban.com and just 244$ here. Do not hesitate and if you want these sunglasses buy them from here. Do not spend 200$ on sunglasses which costs about 30.. The mark up here is just more reasonable. Good luck everyone with getting the sunglasses you want and authentic ones!	2015-08-13

I purchased 1 pair last year and they lasted all summer, started to break apart after few months of constant wearing. Still very happy and will continue to order more. They are jellies so I am aware they will not last too long. Love the glitter in the jelly and get lots of compliments on them!	2015-08-13

I love the look of these shoes and they are extremely comfortable. However, after a summer of normal wear, they are not holding up very well. The elastic on the strap closest to the ankle is stretched out and no longer elastic-y. The leather is not holding up that well either, particularly where the straps overlap each other. At this point, these shoes look like they are a few years, rather than a few months old.	2015-08-13

These Steve Madden's exceeded my expectations in person, but I have to agree with other reviewers in regards to overall comfort - these are not the shoes you'll want to wear when you know you'll be moving around a lot. I feel like they did get more comfortable as I broke them in, but I'm not entirely confident I'd be able to last a full day/night standing in these pumps. I received a ton of compliments though and they easily update wardrobe basics. I usually run around a size 7 in Maddens, size 6.5-7 in Aldo, and a 6-6.5 in Charles David. I'm also planning on ScotchGuarding these to hopefully extend their lifespan.	2015-08-13

The Coffee Liqueur color goes with everything.  At first I thought they were not as comfortable as before, but just needed to get the instep cord tightened properly.  My last pair (in this color) was purchased 4 years ago - so they last a long time.	2015-08-13

I ordered a size up because they didn't have my size... they fit me like they are about one size too big. Sounds right! That is fine for the minimal trudging in the rain and mud that I do though.

I bought these for my first official Colorado hike in the mountains and they did great! They had wonderful traction going up and down rocky trails and across streams. I got them wet and they dried right away. They took a bit to wear in but once they were they fit perfectly. I have a really hard time with shoes because I have big, wide feet and they fit me perfectly. One of the reasons I purchased them is because I saw people saying in the reviews that they were too wide. But for me, that's what I need! And they're very cute too! I would definitely buy them again.	2015-08-13

I ordered a 7.5 medium because the width of my foot is 3.5&#34;, which is supposed to be average.  When i got the sandals they were tight (and my feet are bony).  I measured the widest part of the sandal and it was 3&#34;!!!  I called Timberland to complain about this and ask how much wider the wide width model would be.  They told me it would be an extra 1/4 inch on each side.  So i ordered the wide width sandals on Amazon.  They came today and they do fit much better.  However, there was only an extra 1/8&#34; on each side.  So i gained 1/4&#34; instead of the 1/2&#34; i was expecting.  So the widest part of the wide widths are 3 1/4 inches.  The toe stap is also more roomy and doesn't squeeze my foot.  There is still a slight over hang on the sides of my feet in the sandals, but they do look and feel much better!  So be warned and make sure to measure the width of your feet!	2015-08-13

They are just shoes. I will however say this; I used to get these shoes through a retailer (brick and mortar), but now &#34;blindly&#34; buy them through Amazon. Why? Because the exact same shoes sold through the discount brick and mortar store are actually discounted versions. Inside, they are the equivalent of old Converse Chucks. Like iron maiden for the feet. For pretty much the same price, these ones actually have arch supports in them. Not sure why this would be. But ordering another pair now.	2015-08-13

Addendum Febraury 6, 2016:  I have been wearing these shoes several times a week to work.  The quality of these shoes are superb, much better than any Timberland pair I have ever owned.  I am on Amazon to re-review this product, as well as to purchase another pair.  Thank you Bates!  Of course, it's too early to tell how long these will last as I just started wearing these.  I am so tired of Timberland shoes having the rubber soles separate from the shoe itself.  I went through 6 pairs of Timberland shoes in the past 8 years.  Each pair died in the same exact way.  I even used Shoe Goo, but that only helped them live a few months longer before being tossed out.	2015-08-13

Only problem is sizing: this shoe is not medium width; it is narrow width. Based on reviews, I ordered a 1/2 size up to compensate for the narrow width and that worked. But Merrell should re-last these or provide &#34;wide&#34; sizes. I also note that some half sizes are now not available, making the sizing problem worse. I still must give the shoe 5 stars because I can walk 3+ hours without discomfort or undue sweating. I wear the thick Wigwam merino wool socks now, but for sometime I wore the thin Wigwams without problems. The sole has held up well to 4 months of 25+ miles per week walking, and is non-slip on almost all surfaces. The synthetic upper and insole seem like new. I have high arches, and these mocs do not rub my ankle bones.	2015-08-13

I have been having problems with shoes from other brand name manufacturers now making their shoes smaller.  The Clarks were a welcome change, they fit as expected and seem to be very high quality, at a reasonable cost.  i was also pleasantly surprised that they had these in an attractive style in a size 15.  Other companies in this price range seem to just adjust one part of the shoe to accomodate larger sizes which gives them that stretched out &#34;clown shoe&#34; look.  The Clarks seem to have been designed from the ground up and are well proportioned as a size 15 shoe.	2015-08-13

I've only been buying shoes from ecco for the last decade and amazingly comfortable shoes like these are why. They are mostly leather, so they take a little bit to break in. I've worn these to 5 day conventions and the aching in my feet that normally creeps in over the last few days of a con never came. The one complaint I have, and why I can't give them 5 stars is that when you tighten the laces for tying, the metal grommets on the eyelets dig into the laces and every 4 months or so I've had to replace the laces after one has snapped. I now keep a few pairs on hand since shoe laces are pretty cheap and I really like these shoes. If I had known about that ahead of time, though I would have bought a different model of shoe.	2015-08-13

My first impression is how gorgeous the /brown case they come in is. It is high quality and will protect my frames from my frequent clumsiness. I opened the case to find these stylish teal lenses that will compliment my Rx lenses perfectly. They fit my face and are very comfortable around my nose. I highly recommend saving money and purchasing these Marcolin Village 6725 Mens/Womens Optical Oval Full Rim Eyeglasses and have your own Rx lenses put in at your Optometrist. Please note the lenses are plastic and have a stamp on them but this is because they are meant for prescription lenses to fitted into them and the plastic lenses that come with them will not correct your vision. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-13

I just wanted something I could fold up in my carry-on for the trip over, that would match (or at least not be offensive with) every outfit, and that could hold everything from my wallet to a beach towel. This was even better than I expected. It's the perfect size - fits nicely over your shoulder, is deep enough but not so deep things get lost in it. It has one side pocket for phone and keys. The open design on the side is a nice touch. I've got lots of compliments on it and highly recommend.	2015-08-13

I have an over pronation and these shoes corrected it better than any other stability shoe.  I tried the Brooks Ravenna 6 and the Adidas Sequence Boost 7 on a treadmill while being video taped and had better results with the Adidas.  There is tons of padding and they are super comfortable to wear all day.  Also, my knee pain has gone away after running with these on.  I will buy another pair when these wear out.<br /><br />From what I can gather, Adidas has made huge strides (pun) in their running shoes over the past 2 years.  The price is what you would expect to pay for a good pair of running shoes.  The only con is they look a little bulky but the bottom portion of the shoe is black, so you can't tell.	2015-08-13

First off the price difference is huge and the Red Wings do not even come with an insole! Quality of leather and sole I would say is equal.

However, one thing I have noticed with Frye flats is that you should go half a size down. I tried on the 7.5 and they would slip out. The size 7 fit perfect plus flats stretch a little after use. The fit and comfort is really good. The quality is great and my cognac shoes are just what I was missing in my wardrobe. I also own the Carson flats in black, the ones with the harness.

Made from scraps of material they appeared. Right shoe looked as if, someone had it before I did, as the right outside seam was ripped approx. one half inch, upon removing them shoes from the cheap plastic bag. So horribly disappointed.

These are OK sunglasses, not sure if they're actually authentic or not. They were nicely made-nice quality-just not the right frame for my face (a little large). They did come with a case, which is nice, but the quality of the case is what makes me wonder if they're authentic. The case was nice, has the Coach print on it, but it was vinyl-like, making me think that real Coach glasses would have a knit-type of material on the case (like a purse). Either way, I mainly returned them because I just didn't like the look on my face. Nice glasses though!	2015-08-13

This purse would receive five stars if the description were accurate.  I actually purchased the purse hoping that the description was wrong (it was).<br /><br />-The size.<br />The description says this purse is 9.1 x 2.8 x 6.9 inches.  In fact, it is approximately 12 x 6 x 9 (height x width x length) inches.  For some reason if you click on one of the pictures and pull up the separate picture window, you can view additional photos that are not shown on the product main page.  One of those shows a woman holding the purse and it is obvious that it is larger than described.  I have attached photos.<br /><br />-The inside.<br />This was (mostly) a happy inaccuracy.  The photos show that the inside of the purse is brown and appears to be a canvas-type of fabric.  In actuality, the inside is gray and appears to be nylon.  Personally, that works better for me.  The one thing that I did not like is that there is no key strap.  I swear that there was one photo which makes it look like there is a key strap, but I just went back to look and it appears that they've removed some of the photos (including the one of the woman holding the purse).<br /><br />So, all of that said, I really love the purse.  I got the blue color and it looks great with the brown/beige accents.  It's the perfect size for me as I commute on a train 2 hours round trip every day and it can hold all of my stuff.  I've attached some photos.  They are really designed to show you the size and carrying capacity of the purse.  (Please note that I removed the leather zipper pulls on the front.  Those do come with the purse as shown.)	2015-08-13

US	47169566	R3A2AJWJLPQ31S	B00EAKRMJS	648726075	Kamik Women's Flora Rain Boot	Shoes	5	1	1	N	Y	I wear size 9 and a size 9 fits perfect with wiggle room	I wear size 9 in all shoes except ankle top hiking shoes where I have to wear extra thick and cushioned socks.  Other than that I wear size 9.  So, in saying that I ordered size 9 in these rain boots too and with no socks they have lots of extra wiggle room and with thin socks they have extra wiggle room, and with semi-cushioned socks (cushion in toes/heel area) in these boots they fit absolutely wonderful.  I have full- cushion socks that I wear in my hiking boots, but those are are too thick for these boots and make a really tight fit.  So, if you truly wear a size 9 and wear thin or slightly cushioned socks then these rain boots should fit fine.  I personally don't like loose rain boots flopping all over the place, and its a sure set way to end up stumbling over your feet and falling.  With a slight snugness will offer you some stability and assurance in your footing as you walk.<br /><br />Now on to the style and color pattern.  I purchased the Black/White floral design and at first I didn't think these would be appealing but they were on sale and plus had a coupon discount and the only one that was about $19.00 so I took a chance and purchased this design/color.  After receiving them and trying them on with my jeans, I'm VERY happy I chose this color.  First reason, is that blue jeans really blend in with the color and make it look as though the &#34;black&#34; color is really navy blue, and since most times when its raining or wet outside, there are probably grey skies which blend in with with the &#34;grey&#34; in the boots which are NOT white by the way. It also blends in with the grey sidewalks and driveways, so these black/white boots are the best color option in my opinion if you don't want to stand out and just blend in.<br /><br />I'm 5'4&#34; and these fit right below the knee and I can wear my jeans inside or outside.  I figure if you're wearing them on the outside and water gets a little more deeper you can easily just pull your jeans up, so wearing jeans on the inside or outside to me isn't a big deal both ways are dooable.<br /><br />Lastly, the style on these boots are awesome and don't look like a lot of those clunky garden boots. I'm glad I waited for the price of these to go down!  I will keep these in my truck and when I need to use them I will have them handy.jeans on the inside or outside to me isn't a big deal both ways are dooable.<br /><br />Lastly, the style on these boots are awesome and don't look like a lot of those clunky garden boots.

My 4th pair of asics GT series and am still 100% delighted with the wonderful support these shoes provide. Literally played a key role to end of my plantar fasciitis. Highly recommend really any of the GT series. Oh yeah, easy fix to the common problem of the big toe wearing a hole through the top of the shoes mesh... A piece of gorilla duck tape right in the toes mesh part of the shoes. You don't even feel it, it stays secure, and does not affect the shoes performance, problem solved for me these past few years! Really, do yourself a favor, pick up any of the GT series but I do think this is probably my favorite so far.	2015-08-13

The lenses are large and protects my eyes very well. The frame is sturdy and feels well made. Over all this is a good pair of sunglasses. The reason for the 4 star rating and not 5 is because of how large these sunglasses are. I have a large head and still these specs were almost too large for me. If you have a normal sized head or a small head these are not for you. They will fall off.

The color of the frames is something I always love in my glasses, I own at least 3 tortoise pattern glasses already (all different styles), It probably would have been a better idea to get the all black, because I feel like I do not gravitate to them as they aren't my favorite glasses I own. In terms of the quality, they look very luxurious. I think for someone with a smaller face that wants something a little fancier these are perfect. They aren't extremely over sized, but at the same time they somewhat are, especially if you have a smaller face, I like that they aren't a typical over sized par and just round or square. They also have a bit of a cat eye. Which I personally believe to be the best cat eye shape. It's not too much,like a lot on the market. For this particular style I do wish they were slightly more over sized, but everything else exactly the same. Just a personal preference.	2015-08-13

The black on black sparkle is more subtle and looks great with dressy or casual.

An MRI showed multi tears of this and that and surgery was offered as treatment. I could still walk but I was uncomfortable. My wife convinced me to try a lower heeled shoe and when I first put these on I almost laughed at how uncomfortable they were and set them aside. But then I went on a walk,  I noticed I could hear a pronounced footstep. It was loud; it was my heel touching the ground as it should.  I always wore Nike Shox and those have a very high heel and they cut off my stride. My heel touched the ground before it should.<br /><br />I can't say that these shoes are the sole (get it? Sole? I'll be here all night) reason my knee is better as I have had discomfort and swelling that went away prior to this. However, it seems logical to me when I hear my footstep and feel the longer, more natural gait. Propet states to ease into wearing the shoes and I think that is wise since your gait is being altered.	2015-08-13

But my biggest complaint with them is that they aren't adjustable.  It looks like the pull cord on these would allow you to adjust them, but it's actually just for decoration.  The rubber underneath the pull cord is actually attached together, so there's no way to adjust the width of the shoe.  My 18 month old has wider feet and we couldn't even get these on him.  I felt bad because he was so excited when he opened the box and was just dying to wear them.  They are cute, but I'd say they're only made for tots with narrow feet.	2015-08-13

The design of this flip flop is terrible with respect to, as another reviewer put it, &#34;where the bit b/w your toes goes&#34;. It leaves so much extra room above my toes and the remainder is almost too short. The back of my foot is almost resting off the shoe. The WORST part is that I ordered a 7, didn't like the fit (as described above) and then tried a size 8 and it was the same but worse. The only difference b/w the 7 and the 8 was MORE room above my toes. The sole itself is very comfortable but the stress of walking around for even an hour was so tight where the strap was resting on the top of my foot that it's not worth wearing. At all.	2015-08-13

I've been wearing Keens for a good many years and love them. I just ordered the same size I normally get and they fit fine. I show that they do not have good arch support, but I should explain that I know of no shoe manufacturer that puts good arches in shoes now a days. Years ago all manufacturers put arches in their shoes, but for some reason they do not seem to even attempt to put an arch in, any more. I always have to go out and buy arches for the shoes I buy. I do have some sandals that have great arches in them made by Chaco. But that is rare. But back to Keen. My first pair of Keens, I am still wearing after many years, although the soles are worn through and there is almost no tread left on them. These are just street shoes. The uppers are still going strong. The soles on the Durands are so much better than the shoes that I will probably be wearing these for a long long time. It's very hard to beat the quality of the Keens. As for being water resistant my shoes still are, even with the soles about gone and I would expect the same from the Durands. Feet have never gotten wet with my Keens.	2015-08-13

It's much roomier than it looks (that already makes it a winner), has ton of pockets (again, a winner), comfortable (and adjustable!) shoulder strap, ans all the zippers zip together so they can be tied shut.<br /><br />The inside zippered purse pocket is large and deep, making it a perfect foil for pickpockets. That being said, in both pick-pocket locations, I could easily fasten the main zipper to the metal adjustment piece on the strap, which kept the main compartment closed. The versatility of being able to secure the bag in different ways was perfect.<br />There are probably better locking solutions to mine, but I found the bag functioned beyond my expectations, was versatile and could hold almost too much stuff without making me feel like I was carrying a backpack.<br /><br />The strap shortens and lengthens easily, and is comfortable to wear. The fabric is a herringbone-style weave and tougher than I was expecting (points there), and the quality of the craftsmanship was very good: I had no fears of unravelling, breaking zippers, etc., which goes to show why it costs what it does. It is worth it.<br /><br />It went from day to night very well and the strap could shorten enough to hang it over my knee under a restaurant table. The pocket size and variety is very useful and met all the needs that I had.	2015-08-13

The boot itself gets 3 or 4 stars.  The fit gets about 1.5 stars.  Based upon the Seller's own size chart, if I (my wife) wears a Pleaser brand size 6, then we should order this boot in a size 7...which I did.  They're HUGE!!!!  I'm not even certain that a size 6 would have been small enough.  After waiting several weeks for the international shipment, which carried no tracking other than &#34;Shipped&#34;...my wife is very disappointed that she can't wear them.  Would love to reorder, but don't want to play the guessing-game on the sizing AND waiting for weeks to find out if we guessed correctly or not.	2015-08-13

I am not sure what to say about the sizing.  A previous reviewer thought they ran small, but I took a chance on them, given I wear a half size larger in a wide width, and I was still able to get my foot in them even though they don't stretch.  So I am leaning towards them running a little large.  The outside length of the size 9.5, which should be pretty close to the inside length since the body of the shoe hangs over a few mm, is just shy of 28 cm.  I am glad they have half sizes, but wish there were more sizes overall, since the majority of U.S. men wear size 10 or over.  Discounted sample provided for review.	2015-08-13

I returned it.	Extremely lightweight shoe... my initial thought was whether this shoe would last very long or not.  Of course I won't get that answer as the shoe itself, while the right size, was too narrow for my feet.  After a few mins of wearing it, I could feel too much pressure on the sides of my feet.  I didn't want to see what would happen if I wore it for a full workout session.	2015-08-13

These are a bit expensive for &#34;Cheaters&#34;, but when you consider they have the added protection from Blue Light, they are a bargain. Adding a coating to prescription lenses to do the same costs close to $200.  I cannot say for sure which does the better job, but given I'm not currently in the market for new prescription lenses, this looked like a good alternative.<br /><br />If you are not aware of the dangers of blue light - which is emitted by your digital devices (computer screens, tablets, phones etc), you should educate yourself.  Eventually, the damage caused by blue light can lead to blindness.  It cannot be reversed once it occurs.  Best to try and limit your exposure.	2015-08-13

My first pair were worn almost every day, all summer long, for two years. They survived several machine washings and are still comfortable. But after all that, they were looking a bit ratty. Time for another pair, fit to be seen when going out with friends.The new pair fit wonderfully out of the box and I anticipate another couple of summers out of them.	2015-08-13

They only last 2-3 years, but they are wonderful. This pair is no exception. They seem to run very slightly large, but for the most part fit as stated. The bottom is a bit more skid resistant, but I haven't really tested them on wet floors. As for the look, they are nice looking. A sort of rugged brown strap material and the Crocs logo near the toe. If you are looking for the most comfortable flip-flop out there, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one than these.	2015-08-13

This one has 3 zipper compartments - one large, one small on the flap and a small one on the interior under the flap.  It does have 6 slots for cards, but it does not have a convenient place for unfolded paper money.  I like to have a section for paper money so I do not have to have a wallet in my purse.  I will use this when I attend a baseball game or go to the zoo, but not for every day.  It is a nice size to carry cross body and won't beat and bang against your body as a larger one would, if you are active.  The other Mini Hipster style is not as convenient for cross body and activity, but it is more to my liking for everyday use.	2015-08-13

Best thing about these are their comfort, the sole is much better than my flip-flops.<br /><br />These have a tongue on them and I have a minor issue with the right sandal.  The stitched edge of the tongue runs across the tops of my toes and after about an hour of wear my toes are rubbed raw.  I don't see a way to trim the material or contour it so it lays flat.  I've tried soaking and stuffing socks inside to lay it over, but it hasn't worked.<br /><br />Something I didn't expect about these sandals - They trap dirt, grass, pea gravel and just about anything else you walk through.  I've given up on using them for general puttering around outside and limit them to shower shoes or swimming/beach use.<br /><br />If I had a do-over I would not purchase these sandals.	2015-08-13

I ordered them for my bikini comp and in my opinion they look better than any of the others. Before purchasing these  I contacted the seller about sizing. I were a size 10.5 in a running shoe and was told to go with the size 10. These shoes fit really big mostly because of the strap in the back. It stretches out a lot. I ended up sending them back and getting a size 9. I am still waiting for the size 9 but I know it will fit perfectly once I stretch them out a bit.	2015-08-13

I like that the rubber soles allow for brief outside wear as well as non-slip indoor wear. They're toasty warm in the winter, a bit too much for summer wear, but I usually don't wear them for more than a couple of hours at a time. Arch supports never work for me, they usually make the shoe uncomfortable, so I never search out that feature--these aren't uncomfortable there. Mine feel as though they're lined with synthetic fleece, not fur, though it does look like the fleece is bonded to the leather...<br />Great item for the price!	2015-08-13

Very cute and very sturdy, and the material does not have a cheap feeling. I got these shoes for my daughter and they fit her very well, and also provide the comfort for her. She loves wearing these and I can tell that she feels comfortable in them, she does not want to take them off. Hopefully these shoes will be with my daughter for a while, accompanying her in her first few steps into life. I will definitely keep these as souvenirs after she grows up and does not fit the shoes anymore.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.	2015-08-13

I have now worn them a few times to break them in before the trip. I purchased both a size 10 and 10.5 and will be keeping the 10.5 due to the slightly narrow toe box. So far the shoe seems like it is constructed very well and I have really enjoyed using them on different terrain. I only wish I had these when I did a tough mudder last year, as the grip on these shoes is incredible.<br /><br />I am used to Nike Free shoes so these are the thickest soled shoes I have owned and I haven't minded the extra padding on the heel. I can't wait to use these for my hikes in Yosemite and Sequoia and will be sure to update how the shoes hold up. So far they have exceeded my expectations right out of the box and were a steal for just under $85.	2015-08-13

Nice boot but I did return it.  I only went up a half size which left no room for socks and my toes felt like that were almost touching.  This is not a boot for anyone with large calves, I have skinny calves and barely had room for jeans, not complaining as that's usually the opposite problem for me.  Also, the front of the boot at the ankle and strap dug into me when I walked, saw that too as getting worse over time.  The liner was a deciding factor as well, it left fuzz all over which would be horrible with tights in the winter.  Thick leather, stiff, most likely loosen up over time but I want full comfort out of the box.  Good boot just not right for me.	2015-08-13

They felt like they had great support and I was looking forward to running in them (I usually run 3 miles a couple times a week). They are heavier than expected and don't breathe well. They may be a good running shoe for the cooler temperatures, but for summer they are too hot and my feet feel claustrophobic. I am buying a different pair for running.	2015-08-13

I work as an armed security guard responding to alarms and client calls and am on my feet a better part of my shift and these shoes are extremely comfortable.

The  challenge in buying shoes online  will always be the fit. Yes you can check out the reviews and decide from them  only to find out for yourself that it will be always be the  case of individual preference,. Some will find  half size fir just fine while some would prefer a full size to accommodate their size.  I am a regular size 9  and I have a size 10 of this shoe (Chocolate)  which I bought from their Sebago retail shop. I went for size 10 since I find the shoe width to be tight,  With that in mind, I bought a size 10  (Cognac) of this shoe on line only to find out it was .larger than the size 10 which I previously bought. So I went for 91/2 for this variant. While it is still tight, the length is much better compared to the size 10 (Cognac)  which came before this. Over all I am happy with my purchase and I love this Campsides style of Sebago.	2015-08-13

The new Hurricane XLTs are wider and have a much thicker heel (see photo) than the old Teva Hurricane model that I wore for 15+ years but after trying Zirra and Tirra, I decided to stick with the Hurricane XLT. Yes they run large. In regular shoes I wear an 8 or 8 1/2 narrow, but in the Hurricane XLT I wear a 7. (A 7 1/2 might have been nice to try but there are no half sizes so 7 it is.) They're extremely comfortable and great in wet steamy weather. I can wear them for hours with no blisters or discomfort. I think the new Hurricane XLTs are a tad uglier than the old Hurricane but I don't wear them for their looks anyway.	2015-08-13

I have just discovered the See Kai Run brand and am totally in love with their shoes.  My 18 month old is a big guy and his feet have been described by some as &#34;Fred Flintstone Feet.&#34;  In having wide feet, it's been a struggle to find him cute shoes that fit well...until now!<br /><br />The quality of these shoes is top notch and you can tell that the company takes a lot of pride in their styling.  For being about a $50 dollar shoe they exceeded my expectations because he will only need 1-2 pairs per size.  The shoe is versatile and looks great whether my guy is in his playground best or dressing up for a night on the town.  The best part of these shoes is that my little guy LOVES them.  As soon as he opened the box, his face just lit up.  In the mornings he gets incredibly excited to put these on for school.  Normally, when I pick him up from daycare at the end of the day, he is ready to get his shoes off....well, that's not the case with these.  He seems content to keep them on his feet indefinitely.<br /><br />In terms of size, we just moved him into 7's and these fit perfect with a good amount of room to grow.  My son normally wears a stride rite extra wide, and the width on these is perfect for him.  If your child has regular to wide feet, I think you'd be happy with these shoes.  If you child has narrow feet, then these might not be right for you.	2015-08-13

These shoes are very good at first, but with age, they feel more like bedroom slippers.<br /><br />The sole wore out very fast, and I don't even run on pavement.<br /><br />Initially, I thought these were an improvement over my Brooks Adrenaline, but I feel otherwise now.<br /><br />The main problem I have with them is the squishy heel. The bevel canting seems to control pronation well, but the midsole is squishy enough in the heel that I think it is extra strain on my Achilles.<br /><br />If you have good and loose Achilles tendons, go for it. It is more of a forefoot type shoe, I'd suggest something else if you are a heavy runner.ed these shoes is really on their game. I am glad to have my legs feel young again. It is unbelievable.  There is plenty of room in the toe box, and you will find yourself progressively tightening the laces for the first runs.  The cushioning in the forefoot is slightly better than the Adrenalines. You will still feel large gravels if you run on dirt roads, but not as acutely. The shift of the foot plant to the forefoot will give you better placement accuracy on gravel.  I also think these are slightly cooler then the Adrenalines, perhaps due to the thinner tongue. My feet do not do well with hot shoes.  This is an incredible shoe that has changed my life.  I am wearing the same size in this as I did the Adrenaline, but this seems a wee larger. In fact, as I progressively tighten the laces every couple of runs, I am wondering if I would have done better to go one size smaller.	2015-08-13

They know nothing of how life really is.  They are so wealthy, they do not get out of their ivory tower and see how most of the women have to live day to day.  What is worse, to bring children into this world when they can not be taken care of, or loved.  Get some real information.

I gave these shoes 2 stars because I don't hate them, I just don't like them and won't be buying them again. I bought these in September of 2014 and they were done for by April and May of 2015 and that includes the winter when I wasn't wearing them as much. I paid 40$ for them. It's hard to describe but the fabric on the foot bed started to come off the foot bed. Like I said, it's hard to describe but the quality is not very good. They look just awful now. I liked them for the first few months but they just didn't hold up like I wanted. I wear them now as yard/work shoes though I noticed the last time I wore them for more than 3 or 4 hours, my feet were hurting and I got ugly blisters on my little toes. I think I'm just going to throw them out and that's sad because I haven't even had them a year. Okay, I'm changing the review to one star. I replaced them with more expensive Keen's and i'm hoping these will last longer.	2015-08-13

Feeling out of options, I gave the Karhu Strong 5's a try despite my reservations.<br />I have only been running on them for a week, but in that time, I have been able to go longer and faster with minimal pain.  They provide great support and cushioning.  I just hope they are durable given their cost.<br />Knowing what I have gone through up until finding these, I would definitely recommend them to the heavier person who is starting a workout regime to get in shape.<br />You're welcome Karhu marketing team!!!	2015-08-13

Was disappointed that these didn't work out b/c they're pretty and not too bulky (most slippers seem to be made for winter and I need house shoes for Texas).  However I'm normally a size 5-5.5 and I bought the size 6.  Way too tight that it was hard to stick your foot far enough in to fit length wise.  My heal was at the very edge.  I exchanged for a size 7.  Still tight!  You have to work to get your foot in which defeats the purpose of being able to easily slip on your slippers.  And the material wasn't all that soft and they squeaked when I walked.  Material is boiled wool so it feels like it sounds; dry and a bit brittle.  I saw some reviewers saying that it stretches over time but I didn't want to wait to have my slippers be comfortable.  My feet aren't wide either and I don't have problems with normal sized shoes.	2015-08-13

They appear to have been made very well and they are surprisingly comfortable, now that being said I wouldn't want to wear them all day or have to walk a mile in them.

I looked at some &#34;trail&#34; running shoes and the prices were really high. i ended up finding these mizuno shoes and buying them immediately! let me just say these shoes are like a step beyond comfortable. i don't care if they are not intended for trails as they are racing flats. I could feel the difference in this shoe and how the gel at the sole lessens the shock in my knees when i'm running. they don't feel too wide at all though i would strongly recommend tightening the laces all the way to the top (yes that hole no one uses..) as they keep the shoe from loosening when you're running. all and all i LOVE these shoes and for the price you cannot beat the comfort that you get. i'm one happy runner right now.	2015-08-13

Being a 10, I purchased a ten thinking I'd have some room. Nope. They're definitely a true ten. This is only bothersome to me because although they're comfortable for walking, I bought these to run in. Hopefully they'll hold up well.	2015-08-13

The pull tab on the zipper jingles so it makes a noise when you walk.  I ended up cutting off the pull tab and using the straps instead of the zipper.  Also the back of the shoe takes a bit of time to break in.  You may need some extra bandaids for the process if you are wearing the shoes with bare feet  Once it's broken in, everything is fine.	2015-08-13

First impressions are high quality, new shoe smell, and a great introduction to clipless! I am a 42.5 EU / 9 US, ordered a Size 43, and they are quite comfortable. I would say the sizing is spot on, so this concern may have been fixed. Best idea may be to look at more than one pair of shoes that you own. I anticipate these to be quite warm during winter rides, as they are leather with just enough breathable spots worked into the design.<br /><br />As far as installation, the instructions could have been better, but did not take long to figure out. Remember the pedal on the left side is reverse thread!<br /><br />I saw in other reviews that someone broke their shoe clip. They are plastic, but fairly durable. I had trouble figuring out the ease by which they operate, and could have done the same to mine, had I forced them. I instead enlisted my wife to figure this out, as she is far more patient than I am.<br /><br />Over all, great pricing and great quality.	2015-08-13

I've had my Chacos for years and I always get blisters when I wear them for too long. These fit perfectly and I've not had an blisters yet!

I would not recommend running without socks, because blisters will most likely form behind the ankle.

Buy these!  These aren't flashy, no sparkles, no frills, just pure comfort.  Most of the shoe is a mesh fabric with leather trim on the sides.  The stitching and partial soles, as well as the ribbon on the heel, is a nice raspberry color.<br /><br />After experiencing such comfort, why am I returning these?  Due to foot issues, I see now that I need a more supportive shoe.  These are SO soft that they are too soft (for me) and very lightweight.  What a shame!  If you value comfortable shoes, you should give these a try.  Sizing was true. Also, with so many shoes now having the elastic laces, note that these are standard laces, as shown in the pics.<br /><br />If you find the information in this review to be helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34;.

The faux leather is soft, flexible and comfy. The ankle buckles are adjustable. The red color is matte and just a bit more to the orange/coral end of the spectrum than the bluish red shown. The shoes look well made and the zipper is a flexible plastic, not a scratchy metal. The  1 1/4&#34; heel is rubber with a cute jute espadrilles texture. No padding to speak of and no real arch support, which is fine with me. If you have a size M foot shorter than a size 10, you could try ordering up a size and letting out the ankle straps, but just remember these are narrow sandals. Great sandal to wear into fall.	2015-08-13

FIT and FEEL:  I am surprised at the rave reviews for the arch support in this shoe. I do have very high arches, and the support in this shoe for me amounts to &#34;a little support at the outer rim of my foot's arch&#34;. There is no arch support in the center of my arch, at all. The rest of the footbed is not especially padded, though I wouldn't call it stiff. I think the major source of discomfort is the width: This is a NARROW shoe. Again, I have somewhat wide ball area in the foot, but I've always worn size 6.5 or 7, and even the 7 feels constricting. The length on the 7 suits me, while the 6.5 was a little bit too short. My foot measures between 9 and 1/8 and 9 and 1/4 inches long. I will not keep these shoes. *If your feet are somewhat narrow, and you don't have high arches, this shoe might work for you.<br /><br />LOOK and STYLE:  I tried both the dark purple with neon laces, and the navy blue with mint laces. I thought I would like the purple better, but the navy/mint shoe is simply cuter in design. Everything looks better in the blue/mint/pink shoe. However, both shoes have a fairly bulky sole in white, and the tread area is tall and fat -- They make one's feet look bigger. I prefer shoes that minimize + make the foot appear smaller.<br /><br />OVERALL:  Nothing special, unfortunately. Disappointed! The Ryka shoes I bought in 2008 were the most comfortable I've ever owned, besides my Nike Airs from 2006. Who makes a good shoe these days?? If anyone reading this knows of a Ryka (or Nike... or any brand) shoe that truly provides excellent arch support and has a comfortable footbed and movement, PLEASE comment. Thank you!)	2015-08-13

They were a little tight when I was first using them to the point that I almost returned them but after a while they stretched to my feet and now they fit perfectly!

Completely comfortable from the moment I put them on. I walk to work in the city, and am always looking for a closed-heel sandal with a moderate heel height: closed-heel because bare feet in sandals get dirty in the city, and a moderate height for comfort and walkability. They're very flattering, and not so bare that they aren't appropriate for work. The cork makes a comfy and natural-feeling footbed. I wouldn't walk long distances in these, but someone who wears heels all the time probably could. I wear a 9.5 and the size 40 is a great fit. I've loved all my Josef Seibel shoes.	2015-08-13

I am comparing these to my Kinvara 4's, (non runshield), which I really like.  The 5's have a bit more liner in them, and seem to fit a hair tighter as a result.  I've only done two runs in these, 3.5 miles when they were delivered and a 5k in a rain storm, which is the weather I bought them for.  My feet did stay dry during the run, but eventually got wet hanging around the finish line.  They are keepers, but on dry days the 4's will be on the feet.  Worth noting is that I went to the Kinvara line because of the 4mm drop.  Right away I was impressed how comfortable that was over the more conventional style shoe I ran with in the past.	2015-08-13

I have a very wide foot and these bad boys swallow it up easily in my size, 10.5 4E. They come slightly larger than the size stated, maybe even 1/2 larger and are quite roomy. The width at the middle of my foot is quite comfortable and almost to large, but with a thick pair of socks they work well. The toe box is huge, plenty of room and no worries about bunching of toes and such. The look is pretty darn nice too, they go well with a pair of boot jeans and a collared shirt..could just about pass for a nice pair of dressier shoes, the laces are small diameter, solid black. The shoes are lightweight and appear well made, just not quite as comfortable as other Rockports I own. I am thinking about installing a pair of premium cushion supports since they run about 1/2 size large and have a large toe box.	2015-08-13

I have been wearing these for a couple or three months now and I love them so far. They have worn excellently and still look new with daily wear. They fit perfectly and I ordered my size which is 9. I had a pair of clarks that I wore last year and was disappointed that they really only lasted that year. I did spend a little more on these so I hope they hold out longer. They are pretty much the only nice casual sandals that I own so I wear them with most everything.  I haven't noticed the etching in the foot bed as one reviewer mentioned. Love the slip on, non thong style. They might not be for everyone's tastes (aesthetically speaking) but I like the look and the feel!	2015-08-13

If you are looking for fashionable all-day wear shoes, these are it. I bought these before I left to study abroad in Europe for a month, and I'm so glad I did. I could walk for miles and wear them all day long with hardly any discomfort to my feet. They provide great arch support while still being comfortable and fashionable. They are great to wear casually or dressed up. The only thing I didn't like about these was the size. I consider myself a true size 7, I don't think I've owned a pair of shoes that weren't a 7 except for these. They run about a half size too small, so order a half size up and you'll be glad you did. I originally ordered a size 7 and my toes were spilling over the edge just a bit, when I exchanged them for a 7.5 they were absolutely perfect. Also, another plus was that they really didn't need to be broken in. They were comfortable from the get go! I spent almost $90 on these shoes and they were worth every penny!	2015-08-13

I have been wearing Vibrams for years and unfortunately I am right on the edge between sizes. If a 38 were just a fraction bigger they would fit, so I always have to go with a 39 which is just a little longer than I would prefer. The 39 in this shoe is a perfect fit so be aware that it runs a little smaller than some of the other Vibrams. I love the Trekker sole. I have never worn a heavier sole and was not sure I would like it, but these shoes are specifically for trails where I walk among heavy blackberry thorns and sharp rocks and they are absolutely perfect.

It has so many samples to choose from to make music, and you can make your own samples if that's your thing. I used to spend hours writing beats and melodies. One great thing is that you can make a video to go with any masterpiece you create. Wanna jam with a friend? Sure! You can play with up to 4 people making live music, and you can record sessions with your friends at anytime. Each person has their own sample sets to choose from to play whatever sounds they wanna jam with. In conclusion, I recommend this music making software to anyone who is musically inclined, beginner or expert.	2015-08-13

I decided to try this game since I became a fan of the series with Hitman 2 on the PS2. Hitman: Codename 47 is a very addictive experience, all missions are hard, but in the sense that you have to figure out what to do and build a strategy around it, there's no in mission saves and the continue system is pretty much useless, the game will only save your progress after completing a mission. The controls are a challenge for those of us who aren't PC gamers, the game won't recognize gamepads, but there's several keyboards you can get to make the game more playable, I use a Gear Head mini touchpad + Keyboard combo and use the touchpad with my right thumb and it works very good for me. I've heard you can get a third party program to map a keyboard on any gamepad, but I think it's a paid program. If you enjoy retro PC games, I'd say just get a keyboard that suits your gaming needs.<br />Once you get past the controls, the game becomes very addictive, it forces you to use your brain in order to succeed, running and gunning will get you nowhere, even if you manage to escape alive from the enemy you will fail the mission, you have to beat all missions without alerting enemy troops.<br />Some of these missions were re-imagined in Hitman: Contracts, but they're nothing like the originals, because Contracts versions are shortened or remixed, you ain't experiencing Codename 47 by playing Contracts, they're different games.	2015-08-13

So after taking a day to calm down and working on the problem some more I've finally got it connected again... for now. I opened every port I could find relating to the xbox 360 and xbox one. I reset networking settings, cleared the cache, I even went as far to try cloning Mac Addresses.  I don't know how, or why, or what exactly it was that caused the problem with the game connecting to the EA servers but for now it seems to have been fixed. I'll grudgingly add one more star.<br /><br />This game is awesome. EA Servers suck. Oh and yeah don't even TRY to play on two different Xboxes with two different accounts with TWO LEGITIMATE copies of the game. Not going to work. From what I can tell the Servers suddenly only allow ONE connection PER public IP ADDRESS. This sucks. My girlfriend and I both bought this game with the intention of playing together and it worked. For a month. Now we can't play together at all. Hell, most of the time now my Xbox won't even connect when she's not playing anymore either.  I've tried everything I could find to remedy the problem. If you are looking for hardships unnumbered then buy this game. Otherwise stay away from it and EA until they can learn to properly implement an online multiplayer system that works like it should.<br />IF they fix the issues with it then I'll rethink my rating. Until then they can kiss my rear.	2015-08-13

DMC 4 was fun for me, but I wasn't a fan of the Nero character so much.  I didn't like his weaponry or fighting style that much.  Special Edition allows you to play through the game as other characters, however.  I picked it up and I'm about halfway through it playing as Virgil and I must say, I'm enjoying it much more than I did when playing as Nero.  Virgil fights with more accuracy, and I just feel more in control.  Playing as a different character does change the game up a little in terms of the story as well.  Certain cut scenes are removed or changed to correlate with the character you select.  If you're a fan of DMC, you'd like this game.  It does feel a little outdated as next gen games go and the graphic appear more &#34;HD&#34; than &#34;next gen&#34;, but it's still a decent looking game.  Recommended.	2015-08-13

I am not a fan of fighting games, as I find them repetitious, but this was not that way at all.

The console worked great for about 6 months then the disc drive stopped working. I sent it in to get replaced and when i waited a month to get it back from microsoft, and the console they sent me worked for a week and then stopped. Very frustrated but patient i waited another month for another console and the same thing happened. I just told microsoft that the product was defective in general and that i just wanted my money back for ever buying it in the first place. They refused to give me a refund and basically told me to live with it. I have never seen such arrogance from microsoft after owning an xbox 360 for 6 years. I still play it and it still works. Very disatisfied with wasting almost 600 dollars on a defective product and being told i can never see that money ever again. Mind you i paid for the console with cash and no store credit was involved. Will never forget this event and will always be pissed at microsoft for how badly i was treated. If the product would actualy work i would have given it 4 stars, as the console gets way too hot way too easily.	2015-08-13

Movement in the various environments is free. Movement in the &#34;world map&#34; (which is a map of Manhattan) is limited to specific destinations. Upon the player walking over a &#34;hot spot&#34;, there's a chance of a random encounter. Each time the encounter occurs, the likelihood of the battle reoccurring decreases. Enemies materialize suddenly and though there is no shift to a separate battle screen, the player is bound within a perimeter of unseen barriers until the battle is over, either by defeating all enemies or using the Escape command.<br />In battle, the game uses a Pausable real-time combat system. In Parasite Eve, the player has an &#34;Active Time Bar&#34; (ATB) that sets the time for every turn to take action. While waiting for her turn, the player character Aya can be moved around to dodge enemy attacks. Upon each turn, the player may choose between attacking with their equipped weapon by pressing the attack button, using PE (Parasite Energy) for defense, assistance, or attack, using items, changing weapon or armor, or escaping the battle. If the player chooses to attack, the battle briefly pauses and a dome/sphere symbolizing the range of the weapon appears, allowing the player to target an enemy within range. If the enemy is outside of the range, the shot is likely to fail. Even if the shot lands, the damage will be less than normal. When the player decides to use Parasite Energy, they must choose from the menu the desired PE skill. The same goes for weapon, armor or items; however, if the player should choose to escape, experience will be lost. Parasite Energy is slowly recharged over time.<br />When not in battle, the player has the option of altering the weapon and armor attributes and effects with tools and super-tools. The player selects the &#34;tune-up&#34; option, choosing the weapon that will be altered and the weapon from which the attributes or effect will be taken. One of the principal RPG elements of the game is that experience-based levels are present. Each time the player's level increases, his/her attributes go up and BP (Bonus Points) are given. These points can be distributed to the ATB, item capacity, or attributes of a weapon or armor.<br />EX-game<br />When the game is cleared once, a new mode appears, called the &#34;EX game.&#34; It is different from the normal game in various aspects: the player has access to every item stored in the police station, the game begins with the final weapon and armor the player chose before ending the first game, and the bonus points (BP) given to the player at the end of the game are now available to use. However, the biggest difference from the normal game is the Chrysler Building, a progressive endurance test.<br />The Chrysler Building test allows the player the chance to save only every ten floors and only after defeating a boss. The items, weapons, power-ups and enemies are of a higher class. The best items, armors, and weapons are here along with the trading cards that allow the player to make customizations to the weapons and get the tool and super-tool kits. It should also be noted that every floor (except floors 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70-77) are completely randomized so each floor is like a maze. Most importantly, the boss in the last floor of the building (77) is the true final boss of the game and has the form of Aya's elder sister, Maya.<br />Plot<br />The game takes place over a six-day span in New York City in 1997. The incident starts on December 24 and ends on December 29.<br />The game begins with Aya Brea, an NYPD rookie, attending an opera at the Carnegie Hall with an unnamed date. During the opera, everyone in the building spontaneously combusts, except for Aya, and an actress on stage named Melissa Pearce. Aya confronts Melissa onstage, and Melissa says that Aya‚Äôs mitochondria need more time to develop. She flees backstage, with Aya giving chase. Backstage, Melissa then mutates into a beast and flees into the sewers, declaring that her name is now Eve.<br />The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, go to see a scientist at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He tells them things about mitochondria that they find useless for their purposes. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage.<br />Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses. While Manhattan is being evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages to sneak into the city, witnessing a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after she was involved in a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an ‚ÄúUltimate Being‚Äù.<br />The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.<br />The next day, Aya sees the orange mass of people from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has engineered special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve in another part of the museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates in her.<br />After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.<br />After completing the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and have access to the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya‚Äôs, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight offthe Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.rancis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being.

After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya‚Äôs, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight offthe Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.	2015-08-13

I think the graphics on this game are pretty good, and the little Krypt thing gives it a really fun thing to work forward to. So unlike games like Tekken, you don't just &#34;beat&#34; the game and that's it, you have other things to work forward to. Also, it is a challenge, which for me Tekken games even on Hard can be beaten, but i think it's because of the more fluid gameplay. I'm not very familiar with Mortal Kombat other than when I was a young girl on the beginning ones, but this game is almost a little too hard. I'm more of a Tekken player because the moves are a lot more open-ranged, the blocking is substantially easier and it's easier to dodge. For some reason, on this game, no matter how I block, dodge or whatever, the players manage to hit me. Yet with Scorpion's Ninja Sword, I'll stab people and it goes right through them, and they're not even blocking. It seems to be almost impossible to beat this game, as others have said, and I don't remember the beginning ones being this hard. The CPU characters love to back you into a corner and just beat the bloody hell out of you, and your blocking, dodging, jumping, backflipping, nothing can save you. I find myself having to win by constantly just waiting to sweep kick or do jump kicks. I do like a challenge, but this game seems really limited and even on novice, it is definitely a challenge that I'm not sure I have the patience for. I actually slammed my controller down because I got so pissed :-/	2015-08-13

DO NOT BUY!!!	To date I've owned 3 pairs of these. The first was purchased as a gift and they were great for about a month. During a gaming session I noticed one of the ear cups felt like it wasn't positioned properly so I removed the headset to adjust it and noticed the arm on the right cup was cracked. As it was a gift and I had no way of returning it to the store I contacted Turtle Beach and got absolutely no response.<br /><br />That wasn't a big deal to me, so I went to Gamestop and got another pair as I really liked the first pair I had and was hoping that it was just a fluke. Second pair lasted for another month when the same thing happened. I promptly returned them to Gamestop at which point they gave me a brand new pair. No charge, no questions.<br /><br />Third pair has now lasted roughly 4 months with very careful use. I play nightly and use my headset every time I play in order to chat with the people I game with. Extremely careful with how I treat them, if somebody is in the same room and talking to me I made sure to remove them completely so as not to stress the arms, never get dropped, never get bent or twisted in strange ways, etc. This evening after work I get home and put them on and notice that yet again, one of the ear cups feels odd. Yep, you guessed it, same spot same side, there's a crack running right through the plastic. The other side has stress cracks as well.<br /><br />I will never buy another Turtle Beach product and will make sure everyone I know avoids them at all costs as well.<br /><br />Only reason it's getting 1 Star is because that's the lowest you can go...	2015-08-13

I've never played a Rune Factory game before so I didn't know what to expect. It's sense of humor was a little more...best way I can describe: anime-y? I've never been into the comical side of anime, so that wasn't my favorite. But the farming aspect was fun and I wouldn't even want to compare it to Harvest Moon. It stands on it's own, I think. I did LOVE being about to have a wilderness to not only explore but interact with to the extent that you could. Fighting, collecting, a few secrets areas, collecting monsters as pets. Virtually everything you can do was associated with a skill level, which was pretty unique and fun. There were tons of weapons and armors you could make, which always kept you working towards something. The story line was decent. Gives you a goal, so that's about all that matters. I don't know if I'll play it again with the amount of time you can invest into a game like this, but I'm definitely glad I got one good run. Honestly, my biggest complaint was no custom character. It's so common now, that I tend to expect it with these anime style games, but the fact that neither of the main characters were the least bit interesting to me really bummed my out.	2015-08-13

I don't care if you play this through an XBOX 360 or Steam or a rental, you should absolutely play this game if you love South Park.

Although not as long as the original XIII game, I liked the game play almost as much.<br /><br />Others complained that your movement was limited. I didn't mind as much and to me it was as bad as what others were making it out to be. Things like this aren't what makes or breaks a game for me. It does take a little while to get used to the controls during battling, but once you do, it's actually not too bad either! I liked MOST things about this game. There of course were some unnecessary things, but livable. Only really 2 things I did not: The time constraint and only being able to DO things during certain times made it hard to move forward in the game sometimes without wasting your precious time! Secondly, well I can't exactly say without giving spoilers, but let's just say it has to do with the story outcome.<br /><br />So conclusion is this.....if you are a Final Fantasy game fan....buy it! You'll like it and maybe hate it too LOL....but be glad you were able to see Lightning  (and a few others!) once again! I know that's what made me like it too!	2015-08-13

These protective grip cases are awesome! They are super comfortable to play with and makes your controllers look awesome. I was a little worried when putting them on the controller for fear of the thin silicon pieces snapping, but I was able to get it on the controller without it breaking. There are bumps where you place your hands on the controller, hence the grip. It fits well and all of the cut outs were cut great and were perfectly aligned. I was quite impressed with how thick the silicon was. You can also use these for ps1 (joystick) and ps2 controllers! I think one of the good things about these controllers is that it will protect them from getting dirty also.<br /><br />They look and feel AWESOME!<br /><br />** I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My one complaint is the very reason why I haven't finished it: where's the story? ANB had a very clear list of goals to meet and a very clear end. This one lacks the driving component that keeps you going to the 'end' if there is one. There were more like a series of smaller personal goals you could head towards, filling the safari with animals, getting all the traders, or just starting your family. But this one was tough for me to complete when after a while, each day is the same as the last, and you're not sure if anything will change. I'm pretty sure I haven't even met all the characters yet, not that I think about it and the game already mellowed out pretty badly. Despite that one big flaw, I really did enjoy this game. There were a lot of diverse things to keep you busy.	2015-08-13

These headphones have exceeded my expectations!	Wow! These headphones have exceeded my expectations, especially for wireless headphones.  The noise-cancellation is incredible, crisp highs and rich lows and clear mids.  My only complaint (and therefore only 4/5 stars) is the terrible app for iOS (Ear Force Audio Hub), it does not include the Turtle Beach Elite 800X only the Turtle Beach i30 and or i60.  If and when Turtle Beach offers a new app for iOS that addresses the Elite 800x, I'm likely to change to 5/5 stars.  It is my understanding that this is addressed with Android based devices.  I have not yet tested this with online chat and therefore cannot offer an opinion about this.	2015-08-13

Like everyone else here I purchased this pad very enthusiastically from their home website (precisiondancepads.com) and was very excited to get back into DDR seriously.  The order took about a month to deliver which from what I understand isn't unusual as they seem to deliver pads in monthly batches.  After I received the pad I set it up and started playing.  It worked phenomenally for three weeks of casual everyday use (an hour or so 5 days a week) until suddenly during a song the left arrow key ceased functioning.<br />I emailed the seller and received instructions on how I should fix the pad myself. Note these instructions said right in them that 1/100 pad's jacks will go bad.  Now let me state I am not particularly savvy when it comes to wiring or electricity.  I was instructed to look for any loose connections in the box and when I looked I did not see anything suspect.  The next instruction was to replace the rj45 jack on the front of the pad.  I looked into it and learned that doing so requires special tools so I purchased some jacks and a crimping tool and attempted to fix my less than a month old pad myself.<br />This didn't work well and now my pad is a paper weight.  I send an email to the seller on june 18th asking if there was any way I can have them repair it (offering to pay costs) and it is now been almost 2 months and still no reply from the seller.<br /><br />Unfortunately the pads are great when they work but like everyone fears when spending this much money on one thing, you hope that you don't get the one that is broken.	2015-08-13

I heard about Decathlete from EGM's Top 100 Games of All Time back in the day, and bought it since I own a SEGA Saturn. Since then I have tried lots of arcade-style sports games, but I'm here to tell you that these two are the two best I've ever played.<br /><br />Ever watched alpine skiing, ski-jumping, bobsledding, or speed-skating and thought it would make for a fun video game? You were right! this game has gorgeous arcade-style graphics and brilliantly fun gameplay. The downside is that it really is designed to be played in turns with other people and every event has unique controls you will need to figure out. But if you give it a go and are willing to just relax and have fun you will likely even enjoy your ridiculous fails.<br /><br />Playing this game got me hugely excited because it felt like living my dream of playing an Olympic Winter Sports game, and the gameplay is enormously fun. If you enjoyed Decathlete you need to own this game as it is it's Winter companion. Now if only SEGA had made a modern game exactly like this for the Summer Olympics with events like Gymnastics... Hey, a man can dream, can't he?	2015-08-13

Never played tomb raider before since I grew up on Nintendo products and then got an xbox, so when this came out as one of the gold members free games I was excited. Generally speaking the visuals were pretty good, storyline works, and gameplay was great. Some of the cut scenes where you need to push the correct buttons at the right time were slightly frustrating, but that's probably because I am not used to games that utilize this feature. It seems slightly silly, but it is what it is.<br /><br />Overall an entertaining game, especially for free. Multiplayer is not really worth anyone's time in my opinion.	2015-08-13

Horrid experience trying to activate this, had to contact Xbox's support and wasted over an hour of time for them to keep asking for my code.

Also, the rubberish stuff on the earpieces are peeling off and the in the middle at the top of the headset where it touches your head is starting to peel too.

Both molds are well designed but I really like Spider-Man more. Spider-Man is also more fun in-game because he's one of the few web-slinger characters in the game. Nova plays very similar to Iron Man and Thor which are already included in the Starter Pack	2015-08-13

When it plays game discs, it gets pretty loud that it sounds like a printer. It gets even worse if you try to play intense games like Grand Theft Auto V or even Call of Duty. Now I'm playing the Kingdom Hearts Remixes and the system stay pretty quite frequently during gameplay, except when it goes into loading screens. I would recommend that you'd get the regular slim because the regular slim doesn't have a thin piece of plastic covering the disc reader. It's able to muffle the sound better. This system just feels cheap and makes a lot of noise that gets really annoying after a while. I would retune it if Amazon could give me my full money back, but I know that won't happen. Just save your money for s regular slim.	2015-08-13

I'll try my best to explain this to newcomers. I'm assuming you haven't bought the original diablo 3 in this review. Ill add the expansion review in under that.<br /><br />Diablo 3: Honestly its a very imcomplete game without the expansion. You can get to level 60 and have access to most of the classes(Demon hunter, wizard, monk, barbarian, witch doctor). The main drawback is you pretty much only have story mode to do and that gets old quickly. You can't play with friends who have the reaper of souls expansion unless you have it yourself. Overall its still a fun game for a playthrough or 2 solo.<br /><br />Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls:You gain access to level 70, an extra chapter in story mode, you gain the ability to play as the Crusader, and you gain adventure mode once you've beaten story mode(including the extra chapter). I'll try to explain adventure mode the best I can. Basically you have access to the entire game world, you can jump between chapters, do any boss fight, explore any side caves. The appeal to adventure mode is you get quests that give you various crafting items and keystones to unlock a randomly generated dungeon called rifts. Rifts are my main reason for playing adventure mode as the map is random along with the enemies. If you manage to hit the difficulty max and still don't feel challenged they have special ranked rifts where you have 15 minutes to complete a rift of various difficulties(you choose before you start with a special keystone). This special rift is attached to its own leaderboards for you competitive types.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite thing so far with the game is the developers are keeping in touch with the community and adding new items and enemies every few months at no extra cost. They add seasons which are basically a separate account where you can start fresh with friends. Seasons typically have special items that can only be accessed in seasons at first.These seasons come with there own leaderboards and typically last 3 months. Overall I'm glad the developers continue to add to this great game.	2015-08-13

I'm gonna give you guys the pros and cons of the experience I had with the hori fighting commander 4 and also some features I believe can be good for some players or not useful at all.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Controller is built with care feels sturdy and not so cheap feeling like the mortal kombat pdp fight pad<br />2. Face buttons are Phenomenal, very responsive to all attacks no mushy feeling to your thumbs.<br />3. Controller has a Remapped switch for the L1,L2, R1,R2, L3,R3 and Turbo option of course.<br />4. Controller has switch to change from L-Stick to D-Pad or to R-Stick<br /><br />Cons<br />1. I feel like D-pad is just Tad bit big for my thumb and I finding myself smashing upper right corner to jump forward. its not sensitive enough in that area. (This was the major let down for me)<br />2. the adjustable D pad sensitivity it not much of difference in terms of d pad response but all it does is raise the d pad higher for less sensitivity and Lower for more sensitivity.<br /><br />Now these other features I'm going talk about doesn't help me but might be great for others.<br />1. Adjustable D Pad these feature allows you rotate the d pad 20 degrees, I tried it but feels really odd to me<br />2. On the right backside of the controller is spot where you can place the controller on the knee to give that fight feel with the buttons. I don't think most people will play like that but the option is there.<br />3. The controller is a little bigger than you standard Ps4 controller or Ps3 but doesn't hurt the experience for me but for smaller hands its a possibility.<br /><br />This my overall review on this Hori Fighting Commander 4 Hope it was helpful and Understandable	2015-08-13

Aside from being the most visually mesmerizing game I have seen, the quantity of player options are seemingly infinite and the amount of play time you can extract from it is unrivaled by any other title. Skyrim is all about exploring, and you can do this in any way you see fit. There is always more than one way to get a job done or complete a quest; you can play to your character's strengths and side with whatever or whoever you want. Let moral values guide you - or don't! - it is up to you.<br /><br />With the Legendary Edition, the beautiful landscapes, enthralling quests, captivating lore, and of course, player options are multiplied. Build a mansion (or three), adopt a few loving children, defeat a Dragonborn much like yourself, roam the mysterious island of Solstheim, aide or destroy the Dawngaurd vampire hunters, and get more acquainted with Hermaeus Mora's painfully slow speech. After playing these add-ons, I couldn't imagine The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim without them. This is how Skyrim was meant to be played.	2015-08-13

I bought this looking for a traveling case for my amiibos for when I go to my friends' houses. The problem is that it does has have 8 storage areas but they are designed for smaller amiibos like sonic or pacman. The main problem I have is that I can't have both my zero suit samus  or my lucina in it at the same time due to them both being only able to fit in one square out of the 8.  That is a great product if you have small amiibos but if you have medium to large amiibos it's not worth it.	2015-08-13

I had no problem installing the case and the screw driver was great. The reason for the 2 stars is due to durability. The gold had a chip when I got it, showing some black underneath. I figured it wasn't a big deal so ignored it.  Now, after having this for a month, I realize that the gold color is coming off. Where my palms rest on the controller, both spots have become silver. Very noticeably silver! I would normally return an item that crapped the bed in under a month, but the hassle of taking it off and sending it back is not worth it. I expect more of the color will come off in the coming weeks and will more than likely just put the old cover back on.  I am quite certain this will happen to anyone who buys this product.  Edit: the gold has worn down so much that it now looks terrible. Gold became silver, which then wore down to a white color. I barely even use it.	2015-08-13

This review is for the Special Edition Armed Forces headset.<br /><br />  I just got this headset today and I am very impressed with them. Even though they don't have true surround sound they still function well enough that I can tell what direction the enemies are coming / shooting from. It really adds a feeling of submersion to the game, when the bullets are flying and the explosions going off you feel like your right there. My only complaint would be that they do seem to drain your controller batteries a lot faster than the standard headset but that just means I have to remember to put them on the charger instead of lying around. I paid $40 for mine due to the box having already been opened and for that price they are amazing, If I had to pay $89.99 for them I'd probably look at some of the higher end headsets instead but for 40-50 dollars they can't be beat.	2015-08-13

The only downside is Moga Boost is not meant to charge your phone, at least with this controller. As it says in the name, this is merely a boost in battery power to keep it from losing power while gaming. This mode is not sufficient enough to power the whole device and in about 40 minutes your controller could be almost out of power after trying to charge your device. I just recommend buying a good mobile charger to do the real charger and let this controller just be a controller for an awesome gaming experience. Emulators that I run are just PSP and N64. But they work beautiful,  *April 15, 2016* [UPDATE]:  So the thumbsticks have rubbed away, I've found the Power A (App) option completely obsolete. There's so much a disconnection between the software and the game that it seems ridiculous that MOGA designed a software for the controller in the first place. Honestly, if you buy this you are guaranteed to only use Power B (Bluetooth) eventually as Power A is too much of a hassle and Power B is more straight forward and simple.

And it certainly is, plunging players once more into a land devastated by an apocalypse and surrounded by ravening monsters. Faced on all sides by madness, the player knows only that he has to slay these monsters and make progress, but towards what? The game, like its predecessors, keeps its cards close to its chest, revealing plot details only in small morsels which dedicated players will have to piece together if they're going to have any hope of making sense of what happened to the city of Yharnam. Even at the end, though, one can expect few answers, and little assurance as to how much of what the player experienced was actually real.  The vague, open-ended plot usually works well to build mystery, drawing players into the world in a way that big-budgeted AAA titles with celebrity voice actors often don't. However, at times this can also work against the player, leaving him confused and lost in the world and without clear objectives. At times the player can completely miss out on amazing secrets and hidden areas just because an item's description wasn't clear enough. And sometimes the purpose of items, like consumables and badges, is too mysterious and you find yourself wondering why you're lugging them around. For instance, I have yet to use a single lead elixir because I have no idea what it does. I shouldn't need to go to a wiki to find this stuff out.  Despite the fact one is likely to get lost in this damned city, it's an amazing tour at least. Yharnam is filled with terrible creatures that get progressively more horrifying and malformed, and I lost track of how many times I wondered, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; Destroying them is fun and bloody, though, with geysers of gore--sometimes in unpleasant colors--erupting with each strike of your weapon. Unlike the Souls games, though, Bloodborne doesn't allow you to turtle up behind a nice safe shield*, andforces you to dart in and out of range of the enemy, striking him from behind or after he just tried to flatten you. The emphasis here is on speed, agility, and thinking on your feet, making for a much faster pace, and even encourages recklessness by giving players a brief window to heal themselves by laying into their foes.  Weapon selection is more limited, here, and armor seems to matter less, but at the very least the weapons are all very unique in how they are used and also have alternate forms that grant new attacks. Weapon transformations allow the same weapon to have multiple uses, such as in the case of the cane, which lets you quickly smack around one or two enemies in its default form or lash multiple enemies at range in its alt form. As for the armor, it does have benefits but its real purpose is to help you look like a proper gentleman/lady, because a good top hat is what truly separates you from the beasts!  While guns are a cool addition to the equation, the big letdown in your arsenal is magic, which can hardly even be called that. Instead of a handy spellbook, the spells are treated the same as items, occupying item slots and consuming valuable bullets. And, unfortunately, the payoff for that investment is often disappointing, with little damage done by most spells. Worse, spells have sometimes steep requirements, forcing you to beef up your Arcane stat instead of more potentially useful stats. As someone who likes to play a magic-user, this was a big disappointment.  Almost as bad was the implementation of multiplayer. Before, in the Souls games, you could summon in helpers at any moment, and you had to beware of invasion all the time. Here, though, summoning help consumes resources, and invaders can only enter your game under specific circumstances, making their incursions rare. And when you do summon help, it often makes the game too easy. Bloodborne feels too much like a single-player game at times.  Player builds are also very limited, an inevitable downside to Bloodborne's stripping out a lot of the more exotic stats, with only a handful being very useful. The result is almost everyone is going to have a similar build and the only real choice is between emphasizing skill or strength.  Beyond that, though, Bloodborne is another amazing RPG from Fromsoft and I highly recommend it to those seeking a challenge or to fans of dark fantasy.  *The plank doesn't count!	2015-08-13

If you can get past the outdated graphics, (which isn't hard), you will be enthralled in this amazing, captivating story full of creatures and demons who seek nothing but to tear you limb from limb. This game is packed with stuff to do, quests to fulfill, and they are quite enjoyable. Without a doubt, this game is the greatest intro into a new fantasy world that I've yet to see. Regardless, RPG fan, you gota try it. Its filled wit tons of interesting lore, books, creatures and all kinds of important and non-linear tasks for you to perform that is sure to keep you busy for 60-70 hours. Plus, its so much fun. The Ultimate Edition also throws in even more content. I will remember this epic title for a long time to come and will never grow tired of it!!	2015-08-13

Update 8.18.15 So, I spent a good 20+ hours on this game and I'm getting use to the controls. Trust me on this - it takes time if you're and avid FPS console player use to the traditional stick control style. This game has no auto-aim and I think the intention by the developers was to keep this game fun and not just kill kill kill. You're never going to be extremely accurate in it, but that's almost half the fun - your main priority is to ink! I'm giving this 5 stars instead of the original 3. It's the only game on the new consoles that's kept me coming back for more, the other being Destiny.   First off, this game has a great concept and is truly something different in the FPS world. It was very refreshing to play. The game play is awesome, it's fun, quick and entertaining. The weapons are extremely balanced and all excel in certain areas.  Sadly, the controls on this are horrible. I've spent several hours with gyro controls and without and still am frustrated beyond belief. I'm an avid FPS player, Destiny COD, etc and I'm very good as well. This game on the other hand just has horrible controls, it's almost impossible for me.  Everything else about this game is stellar, if only they could adopt a regular FPS control characteristics, this game would get a 5/5 from me.  I bought this game electronically from the Nintendo store.	2015-08-13

I've only had it for 6 months and one of the earcups have broken off, while the other side is about 80% of the way cracked through. I've taken care of this headset (I keep it away from my kids) and was surprised that it broke easily. There's also a lengthy thread on the Playstation support site documenting this damage (see http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/Consoles-Peripherals/How-to-FIX-your-Pulse-Elite-Headset-crack/td-p/41790995). Check out the pics that other reviewers have posted for more details on this damage.  Apart of the design flaw, the headset is actually very nice and works wirelessly with PC's and also as a corded headset that can be used with cellphones. Audio quality is pretty good (but nowhere close to my Sennheisers).  I did contact SCEA about the issue and they've issued an RMA for a replacement pair.  [ADDITIONAL INFORMATION] It looks like the cracking issue is related to the main headband having too much spring tension. This causes the earpieces to press onto your head with too much pressure (and causes pressure spots especially if you wear glasses) and the additional force causes the plastic piece to break.   When I received the replacement pair, I took the time to carefully bend the main headband outwards, a little bit at a time until the pressure applied is significantly less. The headset is now super comfortable and does not show any signs of cracking at the earpieces after 3 months of use.   Be careful when bending the main band. Hold it on the main band as you are bending it. Do it in small sections across the main band and slowly the spring tension will be reduced. It's pretty obvious that you should not bend it while holding on to the weak earcups. Do it carefully and I believe this is a good solution to the headset cracking issue.	2015-08-13

This game...this game...<br />Yes, this game can be pretty childish--your main foes might be a giant bird or a cartoonish skeleton, but there's something about its charm and leveling-up system that keeps me coming back and back and back again.<br />Most of the reviews on here hit the nail on the head, so I'll try not to be too repetitive.  When you start off, you can choose from twelve lives/careers--but don't fret, as you play deeper into Fantasy Life, you're going to want to master every life and career, and the game draws you in to WANT to be everything.  Want to be a chef?  But that one dish you still need to make needs a certain fish that only a fisherman can get.  Looks like I have to start a life as a fisherman too.  Want to be the best wizard or hunter there is?  You're going to need a great and powerful wand or bow...and only a mastered carpenter can get you the best.  Same goes for a swordsman or a mercenary...if you want the best steel and armor to take on the most powerful monsters, you'll just have to become a blacksmith and make it.  And you might as well become an alchemist while you're at it so you can make your own healing potions and not have to waste money buying them!<br />And as you read this...if you think &#34;Wow...that sounds cheesy and stupid...&#34; then this game is not for you.  I've spent over 50 hours playing this game (over the course of about 9 months...) and I still have yet to complete the main storyline or master all the lives.<br />There are a lot of people comparing this game to Animal Crossing or Zelda or Harvest Moon, and, yes, it contains elements from each of these games, but to be completely honest, I have all three of these games, and it's this one that I keep coming back to...because it has the most to offer.<br />There's so much choice in this game, and I think THAT is what makes it worthwhile.  It's so easy to get distracted in this game...you set out to find or kill one thing, and then two hours later, you realize youstill haven't gotten it...but nowhere in your mind are you angry because along the way you've found so many other things that will help you out.<br />Yes, as many others have said, the main storyline isn't the greatest, and you'll find yourself skipping through most of the lengthy dialogue, but that's only a couple hours of gameplay, and you need it to open the whole giant map and discover new areas.  The rest is all up to you and what you choose to do.<br />And, to top it off, all of this was BEFORE I played in multiplayer mode.  I played it for the first time this month and it just adds so much re-playability and entertainment to this game--even if you've finished everything, it's very fun making items and weapons and armor for someone who's just starting out.  And it's fun to go on quests with these other players, even if they're just starting out.  It would be a great cooperative experience for kids aged 10-15 because it contains elements of working together to take down an enemy and sharing the reward.  And...I guess 26 year-olds too?  HAHA.  It definitely has elements to be attractive to gamers of all ages.<br />In addition to this, I haven't downloaded the Origins Island DLC yet either...just more things to look forward to, I suppose?<br />Anyway, long story short, I strongly recommend buying this game.	2015-08-13

I've played and enjoyed both previous entries in the Witcher series but Wild Hunt raises the bar considerably. It's a mostly open ended adventure with a game map that makes Skyrim jealous.

It's short, but whimsical and cute. it should be remembered that this is a game aimed at children, so, its by no means a hard game, more of a relaxing story and some occasionally challenging side quests, depending on how you play the game. The DLC is pretty decent, too, but I'd recommend playing for a while before you buy it, as the whole game is a very hit-or-miss experience.	2015-08-13

Castlevania 2 Belmont's Revenge is a vast improvement in every way over Castlevania Adventure for the Game Boy Console.  Belmont's Revenge uses a Mega Man style platform where you can pick your own stage.  But it still has all the Castlevania feel and atmosphere to it.<br /><br />The game has a good length overall for the time period it came out in and all 7 stages were interesting and challenging in their own way.  The sub weapons are back missing from Castlevania Adventure and they really add a lot to the game.  The story is pretty good and I love how you get to fight your son Soryu at the end of stage 6.  Dracula is no breeze in this game and you will likely die several times before you figure out the pattern to beat him.  In Castlevania Adventure that game moved at a snail's pace, but in Belmont's Revenge you can speed through the game pretty quickly.  I completed the whole game in 33 minutes sitting in a car waiting for somebody.<br /><br />Everything about this game was very well done.  The music and backgrounds had a lot of nice detail and  the bosses of each stage were unique and fun to battle.  The Dragon boss in particular was a very cool element to this game going through the floor and ceiling.  The game was one of the best side scrolling adventure titles on the original black and white Gameboy.  The password feature was simple with 4 characters instead of 12 or 16 like the Megaman games.  The ending was very well done and you definitely feel like you accomplished something finishing the game.<br /><br />Graphics 7/10<br />Music 7/10<br />Challenge 7/10<br />Play Control 7/10<br />Fun Factor 8/10	2015-08-13

The weight is perfect with all the weights installed, and nothing about it feels cheap, even when compared to some steel-based models from competing companies. The only potential negative is the three-button array on the left side of the mouse could stand to be just a bit lower as your thumb (if right handed), needs to travel a bit too much to reach them, but that's a nitpicky point.  Also, Anker's customer support is phenomenal. The scroll wheel on mine gave out (probably because too much furious clicking and scrolling when playing FPS), and even though I purchased it more than a year ago, Davin at the American customer support line got one set up and sent to me within 5 days, along with a pre-paid shipping label to send back the one I had.  I can't praise Anker enough for this mouse and their customer support, they deserve a lot more than 5 stars.	2015-08-13

Arkham Knight doesn't try to reimagine or reinvent itself after the first two games - it continues on with the same formula but with current gen console power to deliver excellent open-world gaming (even if the &#34;world&#34; is just Gotham City). After playing through the entire campaign, it's safe to say that some of the puzzles are easy, the driving element is a little twitchy, and the graphics aren't hyper-realistic. However the graphical design of many of the characters is excellent, the story is not epic but above &#34;pretty good&#34;, and there's a lot of exploring available to give hours and hours of gameplay.	2015-08-13

Shooters do not come naturally to me, and I tend to nerd out over character customization and in-game romances, but this game had a level of dark intrigue that I couldn't pass up, and I'm glad I didn't! Partly, it plays like a puzzle or a maze, in that you have to be tactful and patient and observant. It's not a straight up shooter where you just have to be good at fighting. You get this sense of accomplishment when you FINALLY work your way past this chunk that you have memorized after the sixth time, and then BAM, you just turn the corner and there's like three giant creatures you've never even seen before and you panic and start running hopelessly thinking if you run through everything, they'll miss you and you can find a check point, but then you die, and you just silently turn the console off and vow never to play again until you turn it on the next night because it's a blast!	2015-08-13

I was hesitant, since I usually invest in the stock PS3 controllers for quality and comfort, and reading other user reviews didn't help. But, I took a leap of faith and got it (for $14, why not,right?). Lo and behold, it came with decent packaging and came with the controller and USB cord. The controls feel fine, it has that stiff, new joystick feel. All of the buttons feel great, and the bluetooth function works as it should on the PS3. One downside to this controller is that if you try give it a new master to connect to INSTEAD of the PS3, such as a bluetooth dongle on your PC, it will not work, and simply just go through a connecting loop. Primarily, I use my PS3 controllers for emulating XBox 360 controllers for PC gaming, and occasionally use my PS3 to play those exclusive titles. But, to summarize, I enjoy this controller! I got it in the bright yellow color, and it feels good to play with. If you have some money laying around and you're going through  the comments, debating on whether to get this or not, i'd say go for it. USPRO seems to be looking out for us, too, as they have emailed me to see how everything is going with my purchase. At least I know that there is some form of effort made to contact me, their consumer.	2015-08-13

I can also reduce my credit card risk by pre-paying!	I purchased a 12 month Xbox Live Gold membership for the first time on Amazon a couple years ago and I love the convenience. I typically use the &#34;Online Game Code&#34; option which provides you with a code you enter on your Xbox or within your Xbox Live account. This allows me to make the purchase and basically instantly redeem the code on my Xbox Live account. It's great if you need to quickly start, reactivate or extend membership without waiting for a physical card to arrive in the mail or without needing to run to the store to buy one. I also like using these prepaid cards or codes to pay for Xbox Live over paying with a credit card or debit card. If you pay with a credit/debit card Microsoft typically automatically renews it when your subscription is up. As a single dad I may not always have the required funds where they need to be when that happens.

Gaming Headset	Video Games	4	0	0	N	Y	Great Headset, A Small Setback	Aforementioned by the review complaints, it's confirmed that although the headset is impressively sound, the weight in itself is an issue. I'm an active gamer, and I bought this headset to be curious of its qualities.<br /><br />Since I've received the product, sometime around the previous month, I've extensively scrutinized the headset.<br /><br />If you've got small ears, these will go over them like snug shooting earmuffs, and if you like killing the guying stalking you, then buy these.<br /><br />The corrective wiring is a walk in the park, but not a piece of cake, with detailed instructions at hand.<br /><br />This headset can be fun and it can be scary.<br /><br />Using the headset in Dead Space 2 was an overall bad idea, because if you love sound quality, assuming you crank up the volume for added effects, when you see a baby crawling across the scene to its mama, detonates to oblivion with a loud bang, of course, the sound is completely desirable and the natural reaction to such quality is fully recognized.<br /><br />However, there are exceptions to the latter that's a No K.<br /><br />After an hour, either sitting or lying on the floor, the twinge of pain starts to settle in, and after and additional hour, it's present and damn near impossible to rid of, and even if you take short breaks within every half an hour, the pain builds and settles no matter what.<br /><br />These are an excellent quality performance headset, but the execution was just not there.	2015-08-13

Less then a week before this version was launched Blizzard decided to pull patch support for PS3/XBOX versions. A lot of people who pre-orded where upset, people like myself wouldn't have purchased this game at all if we had known blizzard would update the game for other systems and abandon paying customers of PS3/XBOX versions. This means that with this console version you won't get the great patchs that make it a better experience. Blizzard basically sold the game to a larger profit audience that they intended to abandon support for.<br /><br />I don't recommend this console version  If you plan on playing this with friends online or getting the most enjoyment possible out of this game look elsewhere to PC, XB one or PS4. This version was sold as a cash grab that isn't being supported with the latest updates.	2015-08-13

I recently bought the PS3 version, and I sincerely think this is one of the best games I played if not the best!<br /><br />I was a bit anxious because of all the reviews mentioning bugs and bad graphics, but I guess these were solved with patches as of August 2015. Yes, after 85 hours of game play there are some minor things like an odd pixel and the game did freeze twice when several things were happening at once (saving, new area, video about to start), but that was very minimal and once I loaded a previous saved game problem was solved.<br /><br />Be ready to explore a HUGE map, with a lot of quests and very interesting characters and interactions. Of course nothing is perfect, one thing I feel could be better is crafting and upgrading weapons and armor. It is very time consuming, and in the end becomes not much better than the ones you find around the word... so it is a pretty pointless feature.<br /><br />Other than that it is an amazing game, go buy it now!	2015-08-13

It's very fun for me as I'm very much into third person action games. I love the idea of hacking and stealth with a mix of combat and vehicles in an open world game. I thought the story was good, good enough to make me want to keep progressing through the story. I thought the multiplayer portion was pretty well done as well.  The BAD: Although I like the multiplayer portion, sometimes I'm just really not trying to get in any multiplayer sessions. I understand that it's kind of a part of how the game is but I do prefer my single player mode to be completely separate from my multiplayer modes. That's my main complaint of the game. I haven't experienced any horrible glitches or bugs. I didn't get turned away from the game because of the story. I just am mostly a single player game kind of guy, I guess I'm old school like that.  The OTHER: This game was super hyped up and for that I feel like the reviews are biased for or against this game. If you never got this game when it launched and you get it now I think the reviews would be different considering the cost of the game. I really love this game and I thought they did a great job especially coming from a company that keeps releasing Assassins Creed games yearly or however often they do it.  The REMINDER: Also just remember, I'm different from you. This is how I feel about the game personally. If you hate the game, that's fine. If you love the game, sweet we have something in common! But just remember this is a review from my viewpoint so take it with a grain of salt as they say.	2015-08-13

Storyline is shaky at best, but if you ever enjoyed mech warrior games and FPS you'll definitely enjoy this. It is pretty fast paced and there are lots of strategy that can be used between your titan and being on foot. Probably much more fun and easier to win matches if you are playing with a group of friends. When compared to a lot of FPS games these days this game doesn't have too large of matches (8 people per?). It was entertaining, but as time passes this will probably be a small blip in the xbox one game library.	2015-08-13

It doesn't have very good replay value, but I played it twice all the way through and enjoyed both sessions.  I tell people it's like Crash Bandicoot meets God Of War, but it looks like Pixar made it.  It reminds me of more of an old-school style of platforming.  Unfortunately, it's not the best game out there for showing off the raw power of the PS4.  Otherwise, I like Knack: tight control, great story, cool characters, fun platforming.	2015-08-13

Tons of fun characters and a really intriguing story that I would stay up way too long investing time into before I realized that I probably needed sleep. I, initially, played the PS2 version of this game about a week before purchasing the Vita version (which I played on the PS TV, which I payed for... totaling $60 altogether with this game which was a GOOD DEAL, if only for this game).<br /><br />I loved the game before learning that P4G was essentially the DEFINITIVE EDITION of the same game. Loads more of events that fleshed out the characters more, more anime cut scenes which I enjoyed, and enjoyed the new Social Links and night time stuff. IMPORTANT: IF YOU'VE PLAYED THE PS2 VERSION AND ARE LOOKING AT THIS ONE - you can CHOOSE what skills your Persona will get when you fuse them. It such a HUGE change that reduced SO MUCH STRESS and gave me 30 hours of my life back for this playthrough.<br /><br />Generally, they made the game a lot easier to manage everything to Social Links to Dungeons. Except Gold Hands. Gold Hands legitimately frustrated me finally.<br /><br />As for the game as a whole, the story follows Yu (or whatever you decide your character name to be) and his transferring to Inaba due to family reasons. A series of murders occurs roughly the same time he arrives and it seems to involve the rumored Midnight Channel. It's a fun mystery with a satisfying resolve while mixing in talking to friends, building up your stats and enjoying the town of Inaba. And on the dark side of things, going into the TV, facing yourself to claim your Persona and fighting multiple Shadows to search for the truth and rescue people along the way.<br /><br />I am curious since this is my introduction into the series, but I haven't really played anything like this before. I had moments where I planned DAYS to hang out with particular people for a few reasons. I liked these characters and also hanging out with these people affected your ability to make stronger Personas for the dungeons. I was surprised how valuable it was to just try to get your Social Links up so you can level up your Personas earlier and get them better skills. And with your Investigative team, they learn new abilities as well to help fight along side you better. GALACTIC PUNT, YO!<br /><br />Dungeons themselves are fun, randomized each time you re-enter a floor so they are 95% random. There are specific floors that will stay the same, but generally they won't. Shadows are encountered in dungeons, not random encounters, which give you a chance to get an attack advantage if you hit them from behind... and same goes for them, if they hit you from behind or first without you reacting they'll get an attack advantage. UTILIZE THIS. Each Shadow tends to have a weakness to a particular element which you can use to gain an additional turn. It's a fun mechanic that I feel is unique to the Shin Megami Tensei series, including Persona. Might have resistances of varying degrees.<br /><br />Stylistically, this game is stellar. I love the presentation because it is tonally consistent ALL the way through, I feel. Really upbeat music, which I was surprised to really enjoy and continue to listen to past completion. Everything feels super slick. It's got some good UI.<br /><br />I don't have many complaints. I feel like any rough edges were refined from the original release. Can be confusing to get some Personas without a guide or to progress some quests. Occasionally tedious quests.<br /><br />The expected average playtime through this game is about ~100 hours, more if you REALLY invest in the Social Linking and Levelling. I have spent 140+ on this version. I highly recommend it. If you're me... dangerously addicting.ected your ability to make stronger Personas for the dungeons.

Kratos is a badass.  Kicking Olympian arse never seems to get old.  The PS4 takes the best entry in the series (III) and revamps the graphics to make it look more beautiful than ever.  I had played God of War III all the way through 3 times for PS3 (it's that good).  I'm on my first run through the PS4 version and I'm enjoying every second of it.  Nothing has changed in terms of controls or gameplay - only the visuals have been made to look better.  Totally worth $40 in my estimation.	2015-08-13

Since it carries a hefty price tag I did my research. Got it yesterday and while I do like the design the screen left a little to be desired. Out of the box it's not very crisp when it comes to sharpness and there's no way to tune it. In the menu you can only adjust brightness, contrast, and color saturation. I found this very disappointing after paying so much for it. So I'm going to hang on to it for at least a little while longer to see if my opinion changes on it. While it's a great product, the calibration options leave a little to be desired.	2015-08-13

I own 2 of these chargers and we love them.  I recently purchased our 2nd charger after my daughter received the Wii U for her birthday and we were running through batteries too quickly with her new controller.  We already owned this charger and wanted to stick with this because over the years it has always gotten the job done for us.  Unlike a lot of other chargers I've seen, I really like that this design allows the controllers to lay down rather than standing up while charging. The controllers lay flat and we don't have issues with the table being bumped and knocking controllers off the charger.  The red/blue light indicators are great identifiers for my daughter and her friends to know when charging has finished.<br />I would recommended this to anyone with Wii controllers.	2015-08-13

After a few months I feel its time to judge this product, its ok. When I first bought these, as soon as I tried them on they barely fit, in fact i had to completely extend the length of the headphones to even make them fit, a little disappointing because I don't believe I have a large head size, but its manageable, but with long term use it does irritate me sometimes. Secondly the headset has comfortable padding, no complaints there, the plastic feels a little flimsy sometimes i feel like if I'm not careful I might snap them. Lastly, I primarily use these headset for chatting with my friends on Skype and we play a variety of games from PC to console and a huge plus I found was I was able to connect the headphone cable from my headset to my Ps4 controller and receive game audio, while talking to my mates, just a small tidbit I felt was nice, as for the mic quality, my friends say there is static and its noticeable when there's no one talking, the mic is detachable and bendable which is great for transporting, the battery life isn't that bad when fully charged it lasts around 8+ hours. This headset is obviously compatible with the ps4 and ps3 but for full wireless functionality you have to attach the given cables to your Ps4 or Ps3 to receive game audio which i find tedious. Overall, they are ok, a bit pricey but so far they have been sturdy enough.	2015-08-13

I played this game over and over again, and even after I collected all of the trophies, I still wanted to play some more. With so many different combinations you can do as far as battle partners and endings, this game is AWESOME.<br /><br />At first, you may read the synopsis and go &#34;.... Wait. What is this game?&#34; I laughed too. I bought it to try it. I got addicted. There is nothing &#34;risque&#34; about this game: when you strip, it's either down to underwear or, with special combos, down to nakedness but with large bursts of light that censor anything naughty. There is some language in it, but it's definitely nothing a 15 year old hasn't heard. There is also suggestive content (as, throughout the game, you choose how your character responds to things), but it's nothing major.<br /><br />There is the ability to change your items and create super-level items from them. You need three pieces of armor (head, torso, legs) and a weapon. Depending on your level of difficulty that you're playing on, normal drops from enemies (since you need to strip them to get them to disappear) go anywhere from 5-30. Collect enough of these and you can meld everything together to create items that go up to level 999.<br /><br />There are multiple difficulties for this game that run from easy all the way to otaku (or super-hard) mode. Each has a varying level of difficulty. As I blasted through the storylines on easy and collected trophies, I maxed out all of my armor and my weapon early on. Even with maxed out everything, and maxing out all of the equipment my partner had, I still had some difficulty on the mob-groups of mini-bosses and some of the bosses.<br /><br />Graphics wise, this game is pretty good. It isn't Final Fantasy or Dragon Age detailed, but it isn't The Sims either. Looking around the different places in Akihabara can turn anyone who has never seen it into a die-hard fan. Control-wise, it is a button-mashing game. Again, depending on difficulty, you can eitherslam and defeat your foes using only one button, or you need to use triangle, square, and cross to combo.<br /><br />This game is fun. This game is funny. I don't regret getting this game at all, and I recommend it to ANYONE  looking to have fun!	2015-08-13

This particular copy I sent to a gaming friend that needed a copy and I was able to help him out. Even though UT3 has been out for years you can still find many faithful fans online playing it. Unreal Tournament 3 is my go to game when I'm done with all my single player games. You can also play in single player mode but this is one of the few games I prefer playing online with others.	2015-08-13

The different skill sets that you can unlock and the opportunity to turn different level of orcs to your side to do your bidding is actually a nice touch. This slight difference from other similar types of games definitely makes it an enjoyable experience. I actually purchased the season pass (which I rarely do) because I was hooked.<br /><br />With that said, a lot of the objectives and stealth/normal kills get very repetitive... so once the novelty wears off you'll probably not pick up the game again. The novelty did last for about 40 hours or more for me, which I would say is on the rarer side.	2015-08-13

I have waited to play the Final Mix version of this game for over seven years now, so finally being able to was amazing! The graphics are incredible and I'm finally able to fight all the secret bosses I've been watching Youtube videos of ever since I was a kid. The only drawback to this version are the loadtimes. It takes a lot longer for Sora to change from his normal form to a Drive form in this version. Summons and command menu loads also take a bit more time, and cutscenes as well. It isn't very debilitating, just something I've noticed. But if you want Sora to change quickly into a Drive form, pause buffer it while he's transforming! For some reason it keeps on loading even when it's paused, so he should be completely transformed when you unpause it after a few seconds. Have fun playing! :)	2015-08-13

The thing is, Elder Scrolls just doesn't transfer well to a MMO. ES should be a central hub and only group with party's of 2+ based on missions. Let the main story be solo.<br /><br />Instead, you are in same dunguens.and.dragons as dozens more so you have to fight for mobs, or in many cases, just walk through without a fight to finish a quest. Speaking of quests, 90% of the quests involve you finding something, doing something with it, and returning it. That or killing something. Not as entertaining as other MMO quests or even traditional ES games. The story is pretty much non existant. Graphics are outdated and laggy. Feels like mid quality XBOX 360 game.<br /><br />Controls are clumsy. Voice over are mostly non existant. Character growth is below standard and to park with traditional ES games.<br /><br />Finally, unless you have friends already who have the game, good luck trying to form a party. In game chat is something you have to actually select. It is worthless because no one uses it. There is also no text chat. This makes things more frustrating.<br /><br />Other than those gripes.....yeah Just don't get it. Best thing about it is that it's free to play. But the game is not even worth the 35$ I paid.	2015-08-13

And what I got was pretty much what I expected. It is comfortable to wear, which is a plus. The folding microphone is very neat, so you don't have to keep unplugging it and break the input like you would with a set of Trittons.<br />The sound quality is a little iffy though. First I used the adapter and it sounded like the sound was coming through a hallway. I plugged them into the TV, thinking it was just the adapter, but it still sounded kind of strange. It sounds fine when listening to my phone though, so I don't know if there are settings in my xbone that I need to adjust to up the sound quality or what.<br />All in all, great headset for the price, and would recommend it for anyone in need of a cheap one.	2015-08-13

I recommend starting on a lower difficulty and working your way up. There are three save files so you can keep multiple playthroughs. Avatar customization is OK. The characters are brilliant. The story stands up well enough on its own that first time players of Fire Emblem won't feel lost.	2015-08-13

I have to say that I can see what the other reviewers are saying; you DO have to be a little careful when using the latch on the front. But otherwise, if you're not rough with the case, it works great for what it's meant to do. Plus, unlike a lot of other cases I've used, this keeps all my games in one place that I can easily take with me on the go. Still, because of the &#34;this is not a product you want to be rough with&#34; part, I wouldn't recommend giving this to little kids because it absolutely WILL get broken. But if you're an older Nintendo fan with a lot of games, it's worth checking out.	2015-08-13

I really wanted to like this. I actually prefer the Your Shape for the original wii as it was easy to just put in a length of time for working out and go about it.

But at least its something.<br /><br />As an early adaptor of Kinect I was really impressed by the kinect sports boxing game, I expected the same from &#34;Fighters uncaged&#34; which was the predecessor to this game. I was really excited when I got it and tried to like it. But it was crap. What I want, is a one to one fighter game, not a game where I move a certain way and it may, or may not trigger a move. WIth games like this, you are moving a certain way, that may, or may not, trigger a strike. I suppose it is good exercise. And really, what makes moving in a certain pattern any move satisfying then pushing buttons in a pattern? For what it is, it's fine. That's why it gets four stars. But really, I hate it, I want the game I expected from kinect 2.0. Where is my one to one fighting game xbox?	2015-08-13

I am a big fan of Asylum and City (and even Origins), so I was expecting a lot of Arkham Knight and Rocksteady delivered for the most part. The city of Gotham is huge to explore. I though City was big and I was impressed with Origins‚Äô size, but this one is big (at least 5 times bigger than City was according to Rocksteady). Despite the game's size, Batman is on the same beat he's been since the beginning. He is hunting for clues and grabbing gadgets that get him closer to catching bad guys. Once again, Rocksteady has used that same formula in this game to something great. Actual civilians in need scattered in the city would have been nice, but it does not really bothers me too much.

I saw a video of the Gunner class that recently came out, and had to try it. I really had a blast playing her. I tried the other classes, and I just didn't have fun with those. But, that's me. I hardly ever group, so a solo class was a must for me. The Gunner met that and then some. I could solo 5 man dungeons.  The problem is, is that I hit level 65 (max) in less than a month, and that's as a casual gamer. I made another Gunner, but it got repetitive quick!  The issue that I really have with this game, is that you only get 2 character slots, unless purchase more character slots through their store. Which I can appreciate for the free game. However, as a subscriber, you still only get 2 characters, unless you buy more slots in their store for real money, or, you buy the original game release, like this. Then you can get 8 character slots.  I have played many other F2P (Free To Play) games, where I have subscribed, and as a subscriber, you get a WHOLE lot more for your monthly fee. Rift comes to mind.  I'd like to point out, that you do not need to buy the game to be able to play it. I bought it so I could have extra character slots.  Pros - Beautiful graphics. Runs real smooth. Great animation. Gunner class is a lot of fun. The one good thing about being a subscriber is that you get an Atlas, where you can teleport to any city on the map, without having to take a flight that takes time.  Cons - As a subscriber, you don't get much for your $15 monthly fee. Their in-game store prices are high. No tutorial for crafting. Not much economy for crafters, as you get better weapons by doing a class quest. Armor is scarce.	2015-08-13

The graphics are great, the controls are smooth and sound is spot on.  For soccer fans, you must own this game.  For those people who haze zero interest in watching soccer on TV (like me), you'll still find entertainment value in this game.  It's fun to play the computer, but playing against live competition is a blast.  It also has a career mode that is highly entertaining and easy to navigate.  I certainly reccomend this game!	2015-08-13

For years too they have taken away content rather than added any. The newest version of the game only has 12 golfers and 8 courses built in to the game. I was told there would be free dlc to beef the game up because EA dropped the ball on release. As many people know EA doesn't give anything to people for FREE. The Golf Club is a great game that takes the best of what Tiger Woods was and turns it into a much more simple game. Yes the controls are a bit awkward at first, but your control will improve over time. People have become brainwashed into blindly buying EA Golf game because they just assume the game is great and it just isn't.	2015-08-13

But few video games have encourage me to travel their worlds and explore (almost) everything the game has to offer.<br /><br />The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of those games, worth every single penny of its $60 retail price.<br /><br />The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt tells the story of Geralt of Rivia, a mutated human whose misconceived profession is to fight monsters. Geralt is searching for his lost love, Yennefer, and his ward, or &#34;adopted&#34; daughter, Ciri, while trying to fend off a demonic group known as The Wild Hunt, who are also tracking Ciri for unknown reasons. Depending on players' choices, Geralt can be either a heartless rogue, or a benevolent anti-hero. Regardless the path, Geralt is still a most candid and likeable protagonists.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is wonderfully designed and written. Meeting each character was a pleasure, with each encounter uncovering motives and backstory that felt natural and interesting.<br /><br />The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the best-looking open world game I have played to date. Every object received the utmost attention and care, and the details and emotions brought forth by each character were astonishing. Similarly, the audio track was spot on, always matching the action on screen, especially before an epic boss battle.<br /><br />The dedicated people at CD Projekt Red have crafted a game that will go down in history as on of the greatest games ever made.	2015-08-13

Defense Grid 2 for the PS4 and Plants v Zombies on the PS3. So I kinda know what to expect for a tower defense game. And this game hands down, tops them all. The production value on this game is amazing. It feels like a AAA title. Even though professional gamers and critics refuse to play this game, Destructoid is the only one who has yet to publish a metacritic review, I feel like this is one of my favorite games in this generation. The controls are crisp. I can easily pop into zoomed out battlefield mode, and zoom in, jump from turret to turret. It's fun to micromanage each turret, you won't get bored waiting for the money for your next upgrade, because you're busy shooting bad guys.<br /><br />I love the wide array of characters. I like how the turrets feel and handle. They aren't too overpowered. And it's not too underpowered. It puts the gameplay difficulty right there at the sweet spot. I love the geographical layers of the battlefield. You have to keep in mind, obstructions, soldiers in bunkers, etc.It's not like the other TD games, where it all occurs on a flat surface. I love the varied settings. The night environments where you can barely tell where your enemies are. The cartoony unicorn world. etc. Just nice color palettes.<br /><br />Uplay features are nice. You play the game, you get uplay points, you spend the uplay points on cool gear and coin packs for the game. Win win.<br /><br />I'm a lone gamer. I don't do multiplayer so I can't comment on the multiplayer aspect of the game. I can't comment on day 1 bugs either. Cause I bought this game a day later and installed the update file which I assumed got rid of the bugs.<br /><br />Some tips for the value gamers out there. I don't recommend the $15 stripped down version you can get digitally. You do get a high quality game for $15. But lots of characters are missing. I would only recommend the $15 route, if you want to divide the payments intotwo. Like if you have $15 now and want to play. And in two weeks, you're getting allowance money or your paycheck and will buy the rest of the characters then. That's a fine way to go.<br /><br />So yeah, great game. Check the youtube videos out to see if the gameplay vids are your cup of tea. But yeah, I love this game.	2015-08-13

That game was so amazing that it just blew my mind. Therefore I had to give this one a try. After finishing the story and playing new game+, here is what I think.<br />***********************************************************************************PROS*************************************************************************************<br />-Stealth and Combat Mechanics: This is what I liked the most about the Arkham City and also what I like the most about this game. You can take the enemies out sneakily or just beat them up using Batman's physical skills as well as unique gadgets. The game gives you plenty of options in terms of how you want to take the enemies out in most of the areas and one you master some basic controls this stealth and combat gameplay becomes quite fun and addicting. It was the best part of this game.<br /><br />-Gotham Openworld Gameplay: This game has a very nicely designed Gotham city with a lo... Read more	2015-08-13

This is the same exact controller as a standard Xbox One controller, it just looks a lot cooler with the Titanfall skin. The current high price is due to the limited release of the controller. It's just a nice controller to have if you enjoyed the game and want a piece of Xbox history since it was the first special edition controller by Microsoft for the Xbox One.	2015-08-13

The controller has a nice feel to it and all of the buttons seem easily accessible, both for and adult and my 3 kids under 10.  Unfortunately, I bought 2 of these at the same time and neither is usable right now.<br /><br />On the first one the mini USB port fell back into the controller.  I happened to have a triangle screwdriver around from my Wii days, but it wasn't the right fit so the controller sits collecting dust since it can not be recharged and I can't break it open with the tools I own.<br /><br />On the second controller the left analog stick get's stuck in the up/up-left position.  While I can play through it (by always returning it to center), this drives the kids crazy and essentially unusable.	2015-08-13

I thought they were different, but boy was I wrong. Bungie has taught us that buying a game a year or two after its release is now the way to go. Otherwise, they will promise content, just to screw you by charging a ridiculous amount of money for it ($20,$20, and $40 for each expansion, respectively). 4 stars for the game itself, -3 (and should be more) for Bungie being bunch of greedy pricks.	2015-08-13
