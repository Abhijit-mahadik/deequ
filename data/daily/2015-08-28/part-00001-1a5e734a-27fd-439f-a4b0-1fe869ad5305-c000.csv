US	15236349	R3J7PSJ53POQQ1	B005EYRAUK	961959489	Sonic Generations	Video Games	5	1	1	N	N	I enjoyed it	This isn't really a review, but mostly what I like about this game in my opinion.<br /><br />Although shorter than the Xbox 360/PS3 version, Sonic Generations for the 3DS is still a fun game...BUT I wish there were more levels. They didn't even include a stage from Sonic Heroes, though I suppose the Special Stages and stage select soundtrack make up for it...I guess. One thing both versions of the game did do right however was using Chemical Plant Zone and Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2 as in my opinion those were the best, memorable stages of that game. The rival battles here were meh...not really special to me and the Time Eater boss I have to admit was less frustrating than the 360 version.<br /><br />The stages are lush and beautiful especially Casino Night, Tropical Resort and Emerald Coast. A nice memory of my Sonic Adventure DX days making me wish that they ported Sonic Adventure to the GBA or DS. 2D stages of that game would've been interesting.<br /><br />If Sega decides to do another Generations game during Sonics 25th or 30th anniversary I'd want a full 3D version of the original classic Sonic the Hedgehog.<br /><br />Like most reviews here the game can be beaten in a few hours but Mission mode will surely keep players coming back. I've finished all missions and got S rankings in every stage so there's not much else for me to do then to improve my profile card. Pick this game up if you're a Sonic fan and want to relive those days of the Genesis and Dreamcast/Gamecube. Or else watch the playthrough videos on youtube to see how the game plays.	2015-08-28

Looking at only about 6-8 hours of charge time before the controller will need docked	Overall, this is a pretty good charging station for the XBOX.  My only real complaint with it is that the batteries don't last as long as I would like them to.  With regular batteries I can get maybe a week or so of really solid playing (more than 6 hours a day), but with these charge packs you are looking at about 6-8 hours total before they need to be recharged.  Not a huge issue if you have a second controller to switch to or you aren't a diehard, marathon gamer, but something to be wary of all the same.	2015-08-28

It has a great feel and I use it almost daily to play many different games on my xbox 360. I personally love it because it has a smooth feel to it and I can't even explain how awesome the experience is if you are playing an immersive game like Call of Duty or Halo. Also, I think that the battery life is great. It uses 2 AA batteries and it lasts about 2 months for me, and I use it almost everyday for about 2 hours. It also is a great material and it does not damage or get smudges easily. The only downside is that it is pretty costly, but it is well worth the price if you buy it.	2015-08-28

Been using this mouse for over month and haven't had any problems with it yet. The only complaint I have is this mouse replaced the small logitech mouse that came with the keyboard.

However, it conforms with the hand better and generally feels better to use so that makes up for it.	2015-08-28

The StealSeries Siberia P100 packs a lot of punch for something as lightweight as this!<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure what my boyfriend has but it's the one in white with the ring that changes colors and the volume and such are adjustable by turning the middle part of the ear section.<br /><br />Pros ---- The headphones itself (as in the fluffy part that goes on your ears) is incredibly lightweight and comfortable. I normally hate big clunky things like these (which is why I was always like nahhh when it came to buying so Beats by Dre) but these don't make me annoyed or make me feel like it's suffocating me with its size at all. I can almost barely tell it's there. The cushion on the top of the band rests nicely on top of your head giving you even more room to breathe and adjusts perfectly so that the headset stays in place. Because you know, like I know, that sometimes when games get really intense you do a lot of laughing or head movement as you're yelling at the screen. Yeah, with this, it's not going anywhere so no more of that &#34;crap! I just dropped my headset hold on. HEY WAIT UP!&#34; moments. I know you know what I'm talking about!<br /><br />The sound quality is awesome but I still would prefer the surround sound effect that my boyfriend's white ones give out. Headphones. With surround sound. It's about as mind blowing as it sounds guys. Forreal! I do however like the sound quality that comes with these when it comes to simple MMORPG gaming. I've always played my games on mute (I'm one of those people) so to actually HEAR what's behind you? It's crazy for me. Now I see why people use headsets to play COD!<br /><br />I like the options this product gives you. There are a few simple clicks of the middle button to control you music as far as back, pause and forward. No need to grab your phone to switch the song, it's awesome. Now if only they included voice command, could you imagine?! Talk about #lazygamer right?!<br /><br />Cons --- It doesn't flash crazy colors like I thought it would. But that's okay, it would probably distract me. Also the microphone is a mini mic so it's tucked behind the fluff of the headphone which is fine cause you know it's there but it's not like all in your face. But I'm just one of those people who like to SEE where my mic is just so I don't feel like I'm talking to myself lol. But if you're one of those people who like that you can't see the mic, then great! Regardless of your preference, the mic is of great quality as well. I'm pretty impressed.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me... I have a Chocobo to rent and a town to head to!nd, could you imagine?!

It plugs into a Wii Remote and can be used with both the Wii and Wii U on the menu and in games (assuming the game in question is compatible). Naturally, the designs are designed around Smash Bros. characters, and this controller definitely feels right in that game, as it has since Melee.<br /><br />The build quality is top-notch, but if you've ever bought a HORI controller, that's kind of old news to you. The plastic on the controller is matte finished, rather than the glossy finish of real GameCube controllers. It makes the controller feel slightly different than a real GC controller, but it still feels great. The ZL and ZR buttons are actual buttons, not triggers like the L and R buttons were on the GameCube, which could be a bit of a downer for some. That said, an L button was added to even out the controller.<br /><br />The controller has a turbo function, but I've never really gotten into using turbo for games. The sticks are tight and pleasant to use, with little resistance. They, as with the plastic on the controller, are a different material, but still feel good. The buttons go down easily and seem to use a mechanism identical to the old GC pads - so it's not likely to stick. Finally, the D-pad blows the real GameCube's D-pad out of the water. It's much larger than a GameCube D-pad and feels an awful lot like the D-pad you can find on the Wii U GamePad, but smoother. Since the GamePad has one of my favorite D-pads, this is a very good thing.<br /><br />It is more versatile than the Wii U Pro Controller at half the price - as a Classic Controller, not only can it be used with compatible Wii U games, it can also play games through the Wii Menu and can be used with actual original Wii hardware without extra setup - I've used this controller for playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl and it feels just as great as it does in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing negative I can say about this controller. It exceeds expectations, it feels great, and it brings a familiar controller layout to a new generation of games.	2015-08-28

(known as Ratchet & Clank: Tools of Destruction in Europe and Australia and Ratchet & Clank Future in Japan) was developed by Insomniac Games, and was released on October 23, 2007 for the PlayStation 3. This was the first Ratchet and Clank game for the PlayStation 3, and the first in the Future trilogy. In this installment, the self-proclaimed crown prince of the Cragmites known as Emperor Tachyon is after Ratchet, claiming that he is the last Lombax in the universe. He and Clank escape to the Polaris Galaxy, befriending the Markazian Talwyn Apogee and two old war bots named Cronk and Zephyr, who help the two uncover the Lombax secret, Tachyon's ultimate goal. Throughout the game, Clank encounters a mysterious race called the Zoni, who assist him at various points in the game, only to abduct him during the ending cut scene.<br /><br />Tools of Destruction's weapon upgrade system introduces the need for Raritanium, an aptly-named rare resource mentioned in previous games, in exchange for certain upgrades, as well as continuous use of said weapons to upgrade them automatically.	2015-08-28

However, the side buttons merely toggle the key, even when held in.  So if your play style is to crouch by holding C, you're going to crouch and come back up immediately, even if you're holding in the side button.<br /><br />I purchased this mouse exactly 1 year and 11 months ago today.  Within the first 3 weeks I had an issue with the laser not tracking correctly.  The mouse would move in unintended directions on the screen.  I wrote the company and they replaced the mouse with a new one.<br /><br />Since then, it's done the job.  Granted, I was trying to save a buck at the time, so I settled for this guy.  It feels like a mid-grade mouse.  However, within the past few weeks, I've noticed that my right mouse button does not register as well as it used to.  Now I'm an avid FPS gamer, I probably play 3-5 hours per week, and occasionally I'll play an MMORPG.<br /><br />The Right mouse button failures are most noticeable when sniping, the failure has robbed me of numerous kills and has even caused me to die several times.<br /><br />Also, the scroll wheel seems to cry or squeal every time I use it now.<br /><br />Basically, this mouse was good while it lasted, but don't expect it to last too long.  Spend the extra $20 and get something that will survive the FPS abuses. I just ordered the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I'm going to have to learn a whole new mouse :(	2015-08-28
US	20452959	R2FSVEE5LQLHQB	B00KSQHX1K	912829820	Halo: The Master Chief Collection	Video Games	3	1	3	N	Y	OKAY!	This game is OKAY. The multiplayer works pretty well most of the time. I really only have two gripes, and I'm sure if you play this game then you will agree with me.<br /><br />1. Menu for multiplayer - This game has a multiplayer menu that jumbles everything together. I was hoping that you could go to a separate matchmaking lobby for each game - go to a lobby and pick Halo 2 snipers or rumble pit playlist. This is not the case. There is one lobby and the gametypes you can pick are must much more limited - you can pick slayer and that includes Halo 2 and Halo 3 maps. I would have really liked if there would have been a main menu that allowed to select Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3 or Halo 4 and from there went to the same menu you could expect from each respective game. This leads to...<br /><br />2. Controls! - I never thought about it, but the controls changed from Halo 2 to Halo 3 and even to Halo 4. You can't just use the legacy controls for each game. They created a new &#34;Universal&#34; default that just doesn't quite provide the one size fits all that they intended it for. Sure, there are several variations but none of them work well with all of the games (grenade switching..deploying items). I can't believe they don't just let you customize the controls for exactly how you want them. It's not a big deal, just a little annoying.<br /><br />All in all, these aren't two huge issues that should prevent you from getting the game. They, unfortunately, along with the initial poor matchmaking experience, are two common sense things, that prevent this collection from being as great as it should be.	2015-08-28

This game is totally comparable to The Legend of Zelda in its constant action and nonlinear progression. I would consider it even better in a couple of ways; for example, you can equip multiple different weapons/armor/shields/spells and rotate them out at will depending on the situation. You have to figure out which combo to use for different opponents. It also has a leveling system, an EXCELLENT save system (you can save/load anywhere on the map except for certain hostile zones). The combat system is also a precursor to The Secret of Mana and I would even say Secret of Mana ripped this off a bit.<br /><br />The music is irresistible after a few listens, the controls are snappy, and the graphics are colorful. I am really surprised this isn't more famous. CHECK IT OUT!	2015-08-28

Great music too.	- Introduction -<br /><br />IA/VT Colorful is a recently released Japanese music game for PS Vita. It probably won't ever be released in the West, according to producer Kenichiro Takaki, so if you want to play it, import it. The menus use lots of English and there is no story to follow, so knowledge of Japanese is not necessary at all. The game is massive, featuring 60 full-length songs, all sung by a vocaloid named IA (pronounced &#34;eee-yah&#34;).<br /><br />- My Background -<br /><br />I am coming to this game much more as a general music game fan than as a Vocaloid music fan. I am a big fan of music games, my favorites being DDR (back in the PS1 era) and Elite Beat Agents (NDS). I've also played a decent amount of Guitar Hero, Rock Band, DJ MAX and Bit.Trip Runner2. But I've only played a short demo of Hatsune Miku Project Diva f and I don't know much about Vocaloids. (Although this game is slowly changing that!)<br /><br />- Gameplay -<br /><br />The gameplay is easy to understand and fun. There are 8 different face button notes and special &#34;colorful notes&#34; which are triggered by any button and boost the score multiplier. I really like that there are no touch controls at all, which I have always found kind of gimmicky in music games. The goal is to try to max your combo and get as many &#34;Cool&#34; note scores as possible, and it's quite a rush to finally succeed and get the ultimate SSS and Perfect Combo rankings on a song.<br /><br />On a technical level, the game is really solid. The note scoring system (Cool/Nice/Safe/Miss for each note) is tight and balanced. And thanks to the great visual and sound design, you get really great feedback on your timing, if you are early, late or missed it. In comparison, it seems like a lot of music games don't give good feedback on your timing. These games are either frustrating to play or unsatisfying because they introduce sloppier scoring systems to compensate. So I am really impressed that IA/VT pairs a demanding scoring system with such great feedback. This makes improving your skill easier and more satisfying than many other music games.<br /><br />I started playing on Normal in &#34;Free Play&#34; mode. It seemed a little too easy at first, but the challenge ramped up really nicely as I unlocked songs, with lots of fun tricks and fast notes to keep me on my toes. It was a nice touch that the last unlocked songs on Normal difficulty have about the same challenge as the first songs on Hard difficulty. The challenge keeps progressing up to the final songs on Hard, which are all rated 9/10 or 10/10 for challenge.<br /><br />There is also &#34;Step Up Play&#34; mode, which is essentially a campaign mode where each level gives you a specific song (or 2 or 3 songs in a row), applies a modifier (like random or hidden notes) and you are challenged to get at least S ranking, or a certain number of &#34;Cool&#34; notes. This was pretty fun and gets quite tricky too!<br /><br />- Graphics -<br /><br />Overall this game looks absolutely stellar. It's hard to even think of a single ugly thing in it. The UI is incredibly polished and even the default note skins look fantastic. I'm not even sure that Persona 5, when it comes out, will have better looking UI than this game.<br /><br />Regarding the songs themselves, most have video animations or slideshows going on in the background, ranging from meh to awesome. Some songs you can play with costumes and 3D animations, which are cool but mainly just show IA staring out into space while walking or standing and not lip-syncing to the song. From what I've seen, Project Diva f has way higher quality song animations, but this was never really a selling point of the game for me and I think it is perfectly fine the way it is.<br /><br />- Music -<br /><br />I think this music is pretty cool on the whole. I've played every song at least 2 or 3 times now and most of them keep growing on me. I really like indie-rock and post-rock kind of stuffand a lot of these songs felt inspired by this kind of music. Lots of wacky, interesting rhythms. Lots of pop, electronic and metal elements. The Vocaloid singing is obviously all digital, but many of the backing guitars and drums sound like they were performed live by skilled musicians. This isn't the kind of stuff I ever imagined being in a music game, but I think it all works really well.<br /><br />Still, I'm left wondering who are the people who are making these songs? I looked into one song I liked called Migawari Kibonnu. Between Youtube and Nicovideo, the song's PV has gotten around 35,000 views total over two years. This seems like an absurdly small number of views for something cool enough to be put into a video game. The song's creator was Manabe Shuichi, a mysterious person who plays bass in the band Soutaisei Riron (literally &#34;Theory of Relativity&#34;), produces for a young female singer named Hanae, and plays in the self-described &#34;brutal orchestra&#34; music collective Vampillia. I still don't even know what he looks like, but these other projects seem just as interesting and unusual as this one song that he contributed to IA Project. I suspect the backstories for the other 59 songs in this video game are probably pretty similar to this as well, which I think is pretty cool. The subculture of Japanese music represented by this game seems to be both incredibly rich and very mysterious at the same time.<br /><br />- Replayability -<br /><br />Like most music games, there's tons of replayability here. Each song is about 5 mins long on average, so with 60 songs included, there's around 5 hours of music to play in this game. That's a lot! With three difficulty levels, as well as a separate campaign mode, it takes around 20 hours to do everything in the game once. Replaying and mastering songs you like is of course fun too. The Platinum trophy seems like a pretty reachable goal, although maybe a little grindier than just playing the game for fun.I'm currently working on this myself. Getting the Platinum will probably take the average player around 25-30 hours and involves playing each song in the game several times, as well as playing through extra songs for each of the 59 unlockable costumes.<br /><br />- Final Thoughts -<br /><br />+ Really satisfying to play thanks to the tight scoring system and great timing feedback.<br />+ Impressive visual presentation.<br />+ Interesting and slightly unusual music for a rhythm game.<br /><br />- Much smaller budget than Project Diva games.<br />- Some songs (not many) are boring or just not very fun.<br />- Not enough higher difficulty songs.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really fantastic music game. It does a lot of things right, such that I feel like all of my complaints are pretty minor. I really can't put my PS Vita down, which is just like when I was playing P4G all over again. If you just like all kinds of music games, this one is definitely worth your time. More so than your Rock Bands and Guitar Heros if you have the slightest leaning towards Japanese music. If you like Project Diva games, I'm no expert, but I think this one is worth your time too. You might love the music, or you might not, but you will probably at least like the music enough to really enjoy the high quality of gameplay included within.	2015-08-28

Yes, it is a European New 3DS; I thought that was quite obvious since Nintendo of America doesn't offer the New 3DS in the standard size to North America.<br /><br />As far as cost, it is more expensive than an American New 3DS XL because it costs £160, which is roughly $240.

Don't be turned off by the typical turtle beach price tag like I was... they are worth every penny.	I got these to replace my PC headset, as it was decent but just kind of a no name one that didn't have many features. I already have an extremely nice (albeit much more expensive) pair of turtle beach's for my 360, so I'm pretty well stuck on this brand now. They are highly rated and widely used for a reason. Compared to other turtle beach headsets, and specifically for use with the PC, they don't stack up (compatibility with PC mainly... they weren't just instantly recognized like most products made for PC. Also, compared to other turtle beach headsets, the comfort and sound quality isn't as good). That's the relative portion of the review I guess. However, I am completely satisfied and I still love these things. Compared to most other brands, they are much better. But you really can only compare higher brand name models with the same brand or others in that category, and I haven't used any other good quality brands... mainly because I'm a turtle beach fan for life since my first set.	2015-08-28

Clever challenges, lots of time wasted completing side quests, and that warm feeling I'd get jumping back into the LOTR universe (particularly Howard Shore's utterly sublime score). That said, I'm extremely disappointed in Warners for dropping the ball on this game and not completing it. If I cared enough to do some research, I'm sure I'd find a rational explanation for not including the levels corresponding to the third movie, but the fact is that they went back on their word and ultimately failed to deliver closure to this game. I should have known something was up before I purchased it and found that only two movies were covered, but their official assurances that the final levels would be available to download shortly after was good enough for me. Well, I guess in the future I'll be that much more hesitant to take WB's word for it, and simply wait for them to deliver a complete product, or just spend my money somewhere else. 5 stars for the gameplay (avoid PS3 version: EXTREMELY BUGGY, while PS4 hasn't crashed once), but subtract 3 stars for selling incomplete product under false pretenses and thus far failing to make amends.<br /><br />(Accompanying photos include me as I was playing it the first time, followed by Warner Bros. announcement in March that it won't be releasing the last installment via DLC. Thanks, guys.)	2015-08-28

People tell me to just plug in iPhone headphones but when I did that the mic didn't appear to be working. Then I used a y-splitter and connected an xlr mic to a USB interface with a live monitor headphone out and used regular headphones. The quality of that setup was probably superior, but the Sony wireless set doesn't have me tangled up in cables. I wish there was a better way to keep it charged, it sucks when you're in a dungeon or battle and the headset beeps to indicate a low battery, and then shortly afterwords you can't communicate with your team. Or when you're hunched awkwardly out on the edge of the couch at the limit of your USB cable trying to be plugged in and using the headset at the same time. From a full charge it lasts a fair amount of time, but it could possibly be a more elegant power solution and allow some external battery or something.<br />The sound for the headset is decent but mic level is problematic. I was playing online and could hear my echo from other players, I held the ps button in like I used to for my jacked in setup and found no mic level adjustment to check how loud I was. I discovered that I could do it from the dashboard if I exited my game, but it couldn't be adjusted mid game. I swear with the jack method I could quickly access and adjust my volume so as to avoid annoying everyone for being that loud guy.	2015-08-28

This game is great...awesome story (very believable, too), great cutscenes (terrible graphics, but that's how it was for the time), and ok combat.  I had to take off one star for the following reasons:<br /><br />1)  The combat.  It's just ok...sometimes the controls stick and it's tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didn't mean him to back up onto.  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well.<br /><br />2)  You will die....A LOT....the game is not very easy on the &#34;easy&#34; setting either.  The worst part is that you have to go through all the cutscenes again if you die during a boss encounter.  Very, very annoying.<br /><br />and lastly,<br /><br />3)  The Psycho Mantis battle is AWFUL, but only if you got this game off PSN on the PS3.  The controller port switching doesn't work at all, and it takes a good half hour or so to kill him.  You'll find the battle to be very frustrating because of this.  I don't understand why this happens, but after performing a search for the issue online, it's clearly well documented.  I don't know why they haven't fixed it.<br /><br />In any case, the game deserves 5 stars for setting the benchmark for all future games to follow it, but the above concerns are worthy of a 1-star deduction.	2015-08-28

The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is fun. There is a lot of fighting, but there are also other minigames. My one complaint is that sometimes the dragon models do not display properly.. sometimes they show up like a plain white beta-testing model, and that takes away from the experience. This only happens occasionally and it may be caused by a bad disk or my old 360. But all in all, it's a great game. =)	2015-08-28

No dumb downed ports, no on multiple platforms, this game was made for ps4 and it shows!  Until Dawn is a virtual movie. If you've played games like Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Until Dark takes a bit from those games and utilizes the controls from those. Gameplay isn't the focus here, it comes down to the amazing story and your decision making.  The characters are lively, interesting, and the story is awesome.  You take control of multiple characters and you gain clues to solve things along the way. You make split second decisions that will affect the outcome of every situation and can also affect how the game ends. Starting out I thought the game itself was a little slow. But the introduction of the characters was required for you to really get attached to them and know each of their motives and stories. But the story really picks up and I was glued within no time!  The graphics are stunning in this game. Some of the best I've seen on ps4 so far.  Really struts out some nice visuals. My wife and I played it together and she was like &#34;man that looks so real&#34;  It really does look like a virtual movie.<br /><br />On a whole, this is one of my favorite ps4 games right now. Unique, great story, interseting characters and you won't want to put the controller down. I beat the game in about  8 hours. I find it to be quite worth your time and money. I hope maybe to see some added DLC in the future? Maybe some new episodes? Have fun! And God bless to all who read this.	2015-08-28

I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I'm more of a gameplay guy and my review will be based on that area. Madden 16 by far offers the best overall gameplay experience in the history of the franchise. Some of my favorite additions are as follows:<br /><br />New passing mechanics, new catching mechanics and options, DB/WR interactions, new DB play ball/play receiver mechanics, Organic and gang tackling, QB AI, improved locomotion on the controlled player, ratings being more of a factor, defensive holding and defensive PI. These gameplay additions help Madden 16 to march closer towards to the simulation game I have been waiting for EA Sports to produce. I would also like to add Draft Champions, great mode in my opinion. I don't normally play MUT and DC gives me the ability to play with a fantasy team without any real commitment. At the very most you can play with the same team 4 times, after that it's back to the drawing board. I love suspense factor of always having to build a new team.<br /><br />Of course there are still things left to do and the game still has a few issues which are listed below.<br /><br />I would like to see little to no warping and motion shifting into place.<br />Animation Quality, which the Devs have mentioned themselves. Just want the animations and player movement to look and feel more natural. At times the game still lacks the fluidity that you see in other sports titles.<br />22 Man Physics, I would like to see the physics run at all times and have an affect on every aspect of the game.<br />Physics driven injuries.<br />Signature Animations and Signature Skills for players. I would start with the biggest stars in the league and build from that.<br />New Ratings System, I would like to see position specific ratings and more skill based traits.<br />Jersey pulls and real reach tackles<br />Outside of that I would just like to see the Devs build on what's already in the game as well. Continue to clean up known issues and build on the foundation you already have set in place.<br /><br />I am also a big CFM player and I will mention that briefly. I like the new scouting system, dynamic goals, storyline commentary including drive starters, and the addition to free practice. I still think there is so MUCH more that could be done in this area to make the game more immersive. There needs to be more off-field activities such has developing storylines that affect game day, contract disputes, chemistry, performance hits for players not practicing, real life draft board, etc. I could go on for days.<br /><br />Madden 16 gives me confidence that the Devs want to get Madden to an elite level. I'm already waiting to see what Air Supremacy looks like in it's second year. If the Devs continue on the path they have going on since Madden 25 I think we have a lot to look forward to. The future looks bright.	2015-08-28

It seems undisputed that the sound quality in the ASTRO A50 is top-knotch for wireless gaming headsets.  They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn and often forget I even have them on sometimes.  They block out noise well and keep the sound of my games in.<br /><br />The primary issue I see people talking about is the microphone, and I haven't had any problems with my A50 (Gen1) OR the A50 Xbox One Edition with no echo.  I'm wondering if people have upgraded their firmware on their headphones or mixamp as that was a major problem with the Gen1 headsets.  (Even though it says the firmware is for A50, and doesn't specify XBox One, it's still the same firmware.)<br /><br />Once upgraded, my headphones have worked flawlessly.  Only problem that I have with them is that for PC it requires Optical Audio for the best sound, but fortunately my laptop has an SPDiF port.  Not everyone will, so make sure yours does.	2015-08-28

The game was announced as part of a 'surprise' from Insomniac Games to mark the 10th anniversary since the original game was released.[9]<br /><br />The gameplay is described as a tower defense, a deviation from the platforming/combat common to the rest of the series, where Ratchet has to fight enemies over 5 levels on 3 different planets. It was released on November 27, 2012 on the PlayStation 3 with the PlayStation Vita version delayed until May 21, 2013.[10]	2015-08-28

Why you can't get out the promo is insane, but it is classic EA sports.<br /><br />EA can take a good idea like this and just kill the fun of this game. I like football so I purchased a football video game. I want to play football in that video game and that is all I want to do, I don't want to own a stadium or move my franchise to a new city. I wish they would spend more time on gameplay and graphics.<br /><br />Another silly thing is the Skycam, they now explain that your view is from the Skycam and show it's shadow on the field. How stupid is that, that is like explaining that a documentary camera crew is following you around in Grand Theft Auto. Come on, it is a video game, not Monday Night Football.<br /><br />When you are playing the game I would give it 4 stars.<br />The other stuff, which is like 60% of this game, 1 star.	2015-08-28

When it works well, there's nothing to complain about, and it usually works well. There have been periods of time where it felt like the battery was not properly holding a charge, and that got very frustrating, but it did not prove to be a lasting problem. There are also times when the battery seems to die out of nowhere (even when fully charged) and the controller needs to be plugged back in to be turned on. When that happens, leaving the controller plugged in for a few minutes seems to do the trick. All in all, there have been some frustrations along the way, but I've owned only this battery for my xbox controller for 18 months. I play several hours almost every day, and this kit has been the only purchase I've ever had to make for my controller. If you don't mind sometimes having the charging cable hanging out (which I find is a minor annoyance but nothing more), this is a very solid product that should cover your needs for a long time.	2015-08-28

Udated the rosters. Changed the menus slightly. Added stupid EA Trax with dumb hip hop/rap songs that no one has ever heard of, while taking away the cool NFL instrumental score. This game should only be $20 for the XBOX 360, since is just a slight upgrade and cut and paste job of last year's effort. Shame on you, EA. I'm returning this for store credit. Gave it one star, but only because Amazon makes you give it at least one. Otherwise, it doesn't deserve any. And this is from a guy who has been playing Madden since it debuted on the Sega Genesis back in the '90's. I get that EA has a tough job in churning out a new game every year. I respect that.

Ryu, Ken, Charlie, Chun Li, Rose M Bison, Birdie, Sagat, Sodom, Gen, Guy & Dan. You have new additions like Rolento from Final Fight. They brought back Zangief & Dhalsim & a new character Sakura is now part of Street Fighter.  The game has the same idea as Street Fighter Alpha as whoever you play you don't fight M Bison at the end like if you play Ryu you fight Akuma at the end & this is the 1st time Ryu & Akuma fought. If you play as Ken you'll fight Ryu at the end. If you playthrough as Sagat then you'll fight Ryu. If you play as M Bison you'll face Ryn. If you fight as Akuma you'll face Gen. If you play as Charlie then you'll fight Bison. I am going through people I just prefer playing as. The game feels to me a more difficult I mean about a week ago 1 night I was playing as Sagat & I probably lost to Ryu nearly 10 times. That could be cause I haven't played this game in like 5 years although when I played again I still lost to Ryu mayabe 1 to 3 times but hey I liked it the last couple of fights they add a challenge to even on the most easiest so I'm glad they did that where even if you play on the easiest difficulty the last couple of battles become challenging & you'll have to play defensively & know when to strike. You'll need to know when to trip or when to do a jump attack. Plus you have special moves as well as super moves that were added back when Super Street Fighter II Turbo came out. The gameplay is great the graphics are really good & playing it on the Sega Saurn they look great especially if you can get it to output S Video then do it as it adds more depth & color on screen. The sound & music is really good. So if you are interested in Street Fighter & getting into fighting games then The Alpha series is the best way to start imo. It was available in Arcades originally so if you see it in an arcadethen give it shot. On The Saturn it's more costly these days I got my copy off of The Street Fighter Collection that has Super Street Fighter II & Super Street Fighter II Turbo it was under the name Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. But you can get this game on The PS2 as part of The Alpha Anthology & it's downloadable on PS3 & 360 as well on MAME. So if you like fighting games there's no reason not to play this cause it's a fun game. Next review will be for X Men vs Street Fighter which is the best home port of that game.	2015-08-28

Mine has maybe 20 hours of total use over the past 18 months, is mounted to a Forza edition playseat, adult owned and used, and it has already stopped working.  After some internet searches it seems I have what seems to be a common problem where the wheel will go through calibration and then go dead.  Contacting tech support is also a learning experience as their turn-around to respond is 2-3 weeks.  After a total of five weeks time and providing them everything they requested including a copy of my invoice, pictures of the label on the bottom of the wheel and a video of the problems, I received a response that the USB cable could be bad and I was welcome to buy one from them for about $36 plus shipping from Europe and do my own soldering and repair but they couldn't guarantee that would solve the problem.  Giving it two stars because when it worked it was great but the quality control and longevity is poor.	2015-08-28

My biggest gaming surprise in 34 years of being a gaming nerd.	I have been gaming since 1981 when my parents bought me an Atari 2600 for Christmas.  And in all that time, Until Dawn is easily the biggest surprise I have ever had in a game.  And what a wonderful surprise it is.<br />The game gets it all right.  I am not usually a fan of these type of &#34;adventure&#34; games.  I usually prefer to truly &#34;play&#34; the game.  But the whole adventure game thing is perfect for Until Dawn.  I never feel like the game is playing itself and I am just a spectator.  The controls are simple enough for the most part, that even someone new to games or the PS4 controller will be able to play with the minimum of frustration.  And even though the story is full of horror movie cliches (which I believe is the point), the story and characters are keeping me glued to my seat.  A chapter ends and I am worried...is so-and-so still alive?  I can't wait for the next chapter to start.  I am also a horror movie geek.  I love horror movies, but I am a snob.  I think 90% of horror movies are garbage and I tend to stay far away from horror movies that show up at the local cineplex.  And that was one of my main issues before I bought the game.  It is basically a playable horror movie...as the game makers will say in the bonus features, a playable &#34;teen&#34; horror movie.  Well I loved teen horror when I was a teen, but that was long ago.  I had no reason to worry.  The whole teen horror aspect works perfectly here and playing the game actually has me thinking I should check out some of these horror flicks I wrote off without giving them a chance.<br />I have also played many games lately that are full of very annoying design choices or super frustrating mechanics.  Often it feels like game designers hate me.  Not here.  Nothing but love here.<br />The voice acting is uniformly excellent.  The graphics are quite nice.  And the atmosphere is killer.  Thick and heavy and perfect.<br />I always get annoyed when I hear a game is made to be played multiple times.  I think that is a cop out.  If you can't give me everything in one play, that is a failure.  But this game begs for a second, third, and beyond play through.  I actually can't wait to play more.  Can I save that character I lost the first time?  Can I get that idiot who I hate killed this time?  My only problem is Metal Gear Solid V comes out in 4 days....gonna cram this weekend full of Until Dark.<br />I guess if I had to give a quick &#34;review&#34; of this game I would say that everything comes together perfectly in it.  If you love adventure games, but it.  If you horror movies, buy it.  If you are looking for a rip roaring fun time, buy it.  if you want to play a game that makes you scream and then makes me smile like you haven't smiled since you were a kid, buy it.  Just buy it...there is a lot of love in this game.  And even more fun.	2015-08-28

Also, there is a manufacturing defect in ALL of these where the power button is loose, causing it to rattle every time you move your head.<br /><br />First of all set up is a nightmare. The instruction manual (read cover to cover) is lacking any substantive information, and if you're on a PC a working mic set up is NOT included, you need to buy and install a separate bluetooth adapter in order to talk to people (somehow two way communication was an after thought when developing this gem). Secondly it has a lot of technical issues: the headset shuts down every ten minutes while gaming. I looked into it and it's a &#34;feature&#34; where the headset shuts down if it's not detecting any headset or mic sound...However this would happen mid sentence, mid game so it basically does what it wants.<br /><br />It serves as a hundred dollar pair of ear warmers, and that's about it.	2015-08-28

You cannot save your progress but must depend on &#34;save points&#34; at specific places during the game. This fates you to having to play the same mission over and over and over and over... until (if) you succeed. Due to the tedium of having to repeat the same missions I set the game play to &#34;easy&#34; just so I could accomplish any forward movement through the game.<br /><br />Worse is that if you die, the game throws you back at some random origination point on the map. This requires you drive/run/walk over huge stretches of territory just to get back to the point on the map where you last died in order to continue.<br /><br />Another time I fought my way through a mission but needed to log out of my computer. I thought it would save my progress to that point so I could pick up where I left off. Nope, I had to play through the entire mission, including waiting through those agonizingly long cut scenes again.<br /><br />The game punishes you for playing it; the tedium of repetition of missions and the extent one must go through to get back to where you were should you die, is a huge disincentive for me.<br /><br />The other issue are the graphics; I cannot afford to buy the latest, fastest computer every time a new games comes out. I actually have a two year old &#34;gamer PC&#34; and Nvidia video card, yet I had to set the graphics on the lowest level or the game was too stuttering (laggy) to be playable.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on having to have to log into UPlay to even open the game.<br /><br />It was fun up to a point then the frustration of repetition and tedium has taken it's toll. I am abandoning the game unfinished.	2015-08-28

It's shares a lot in common with F1 Championship Edition on PS3 which is also a stellar F1 game I recently got.<br /><br />This game is already one of the best racing games on PSP by far IMO. F1 2009 and F1 2011 are absolute trash compared to this game and its a real shame because I'd prefer to play on my Vita but the physics of those games are just awful and clunky.<br /><br />F1 2006 on the other hand plays almost perfectly. Realistic but intuitive physics and well configured for the PSP even if you turn all the driver assists off. It also has car damage, weather effects, and the coolest implementation of pit stops in any game I've.<br /><br />Another great thing about this game and F1 CE on PS3 is the classic F1 cars. There are several classic F1 cars you can unlock in this game which really makes it more interesting to play than Codemasters F1 series. Also, you can unlock the Jerez track as well. The F1 cars you don't have to unlock are the Lotus 72E and the Cooper CLimax. Through time trial mode, quick race, and championship or career mode you can also unlock the Lotus 49c, a 80's williams, a 90's williams, and a 50's alfa romeo (I could be a little off but I'm pretty sure these are the cars)<br /><br />It also has an interesting career mode where you have to prove yourself to get a seat in an F1 car because much like in real life, you start as a test driver.<br /><br />The only negatives are the graphics (still pretty good for a PSP game) and the way the game handles your steering inputs. To make steering less twitchy, they've made it slightly gradual so when you go left on the d pad or stick, it doesn't go all the way to full lock instantly sending you into a spin. The only problem is it takes a little getting used to and I wish there was an option to adjust it a little bit but otherwise this game is amazing.<br /><br />The best part about this game is the physics and the racing. The AI is actually really challenging even on medium difficulty and they're also decent to race with. They don't constantly crash into like other games and they're not afraid to pass you	2015-08-28

I didn't have any memorable problems with the first two, but this one has many flaws.  Broken quests, bugs that require you to save then reload (which itself takes a ridiculous amount of time).<br /><br />It's the Witcher, as done by a large publisher (WB).  That means basically a generic open world game (skinned as the Witcher), complete with tons of mindless collection quests.  There's nothing really new or unique here, unless you count the almost laughable character control; the biggest challenges in the game involve running up to a door at just the wrong angle and trying to correct it, only to end up at best doing a weird, frustrating sort of back-and-forth dance, or, at worst, falling off a mountain.<br /><br />I'd say &#34;Ditch WB and big publishers&#34; to CD Projekt Red, but they're making too much money to listen to someone like me.	2015-08-28

What can I say? This product met my needs perfectly. I prefer their ultra clear protectors since I want the screen to look as though there isn't anything on it. I bought the anti-glare variety for my 3DS, but it gives up a tiny bit of clarity. Nonetheless, this comes with three protectors so you have room for error. It will always leave about a millimeter of space on the Wii-U game pad depending on which direction you put it on, so keep that in mind. Customer support is also very helpful and understanding in case something goes wrong. 5 stars!	2015-08-28

The Ghost Edition itself is amazing.  The Ghost replica is well-made and really cool.  It's perhaps the size of a softball and looks great on the shelf.  It's motion detect mode is cool since it will say something when someone walks by.<br /><br />The other content in the GE is just as nice and well made.<br /><br />This would be a 5-star if it weren't for two things:<br /><br />1) My Ghost Edition arrive torn (the gray outer shell was torn on one corner) due to the shipping method from the distributor.  Many Ghost Editions suffered the same fate.  Pretty disappointing considering the high price and relative quality of the rest of the product- they shouldn't have cut corners there.<br /><br />2) Destiny (the game) ended up being a disappointment for me.  It was fun, just wasn't anything that kept my attention or gave me a rewarding enough experience to keep playing once other, better, games released.	2015-08-28

Until Dawn has to be one of the best horror games I've ever played. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen, and adds to the realism of the game.

Every single choice you make can change that characters relationship with someone else, change that characters characteristics, or lead that character or another character to danger/death.<br /><br />Ignore all the haters.

One of the biggest downfalls of Sony and their many mobile devices is that they often try to rely upon their own proprietary media formats. This has almost ALWAYS failed for them and the PlayStation Vita memory card is no exception. Instead of using the widely accepted SD format, Sony created this card for the system. It's very difficult to find these cards at a reasonable price, even for a VERY small amount of memory (microSD cards can be had for very cheap with large amounts of memory). And the fact that the Vita is practically useless without one is beyond frustrating.<br /><br />We can hope that eventually Sony will learn that forcing their own media down the throats of consumers and will use standard formats, but until then you'll be shelling out $80 for a 64GB card like this.	2015-08-28

This is the worst madden I have played, and I severely regret paying 60 dollars for this. Here are some things I dislike after playing several games.<br /><br />1) Nantz and Simms are back for more stale recycled commentary. Love the use of pronouns when announcing. Or generic position names. Other game commentary (like NBA2k) is so much better than this, cmon EA<br />2) Holy glitches and bugs. Connected franchise has frozen or disconnected in the middle of a game several times. Announcers comment over and over how an injured player has returned (literally every play). Also google &#34;Ghost interception&#34;. Do they even test this game?<br />3) New catch styles are dumb. Aggressive catch is so unrealistic and OP.<br />4) If you are a QB in Connected franchise, you have to play on Zoom camera which is awful. Thanks for taking away the customization EA.<br />5) New throwing mechanics are awful. My 80 qb cannot hit wide open guys. Using the left stick for placement is useless and the new buttons for throwing high and low are quite counterintuitive<br />6) Fantasy draft was so dumb. Jamaal Charles, a top 5 rb, went in the 5th round.<br />7) The bubbles that pop up saying for example &#34;20 yard return&#34; look so bad.<br /><br />Maybe this game will grow on me, and I will updated accordingly, but this game is just not a fun time to play. Save your money for NBA2k when it comes out	2015-08-28

US	8978869	RCRU38TXQY1P7	B00MV7KVP4	92208606	Until Dawn  - PlayStation 4 [Digital Code]	Video Games	5	2	2	N	N	Beautifully Crafted Suspense Thriller with Superb Graphics	I purchased this from GameStop. Until Dawn is a delightfully cheesy horror themed suspense game that's full of tough decisions and intense moments. The story & plot are fantastic and the outcome depends on the choices you make. Its like watching an interactive movie, if you don't like QTE (Quick Time Events) then this game may not appeal to you. This game startled the HECK outta me many times, and despite its slower paced nature, it was a complete thrill. I enjoyed the moderate horror level, it was not extreme like P.T. (P.T. is the most terrifying game I've ever played, I literally couldn't finish it). I beat it multiple times to find all the collectibles, make different choices, get all trophies and change fate for a different ending. Below is my opinion on the Pros and Cons.  Pros: -Best graphics for any PS4 game to date -Breathtaking atmosphere & beautiful scenery -Great story and interesting plot -Brutal outcomes based on your decisions -Great sound effects & setting music, play this game with headphones! -Character relationship status changes depending on actions -Surprisingly NOT predicable ending/plot -Moderate replay value with alternate endings -Get your friends together and grab the popcorn, make a whole night of playing this. Much like in horror movies, the characters here will do something stupid that'll make you yell at your TV. The only difference is you'll also be screaming at yourself for the things YOU did!  Cons: -Game is rather short -Very slow movement speed... You can hold &#34;L1&#34; to walk like 10% faster but its still slow. From a &#34;glass is half-full&#34; perspective, the result of this causes you to appreciate the unique camera angles and beautiful scenery much more because you're not quickly running past everything. -Some decisions result in the same outcome regardless of what you choice... kind of pointless. That being said, there are plenty of difficult choices in the game that DO actually matter and ARE important. -Unskippable cut-scenes on second playthroughs. For this game I can understand why, because you may get a QTE prompt at ANY moment, so you have to stay tuned in. However this could get annoying during multiple playthroughs, which seems to be ideal for this type of game. I suspect that between this and the slow movement speed, the intention was to add X hours on a play-through so it seems longer.  I don't usually buy DLC, but I hope they make some for Until Dawn. Despite my elaboration on the cons, the PROS far outweigh the Cons, no contest. I give this a solid 8/10. I look forward to a squeal.	2015-08-28

I am very happy that I purchased this Fit in Six game with motion controller. I've been using this game every day since receiving it. Surprisingly, I have not been very sore the day after doing the workouts, which motivates me to continue with the program. It's easy to operate once you get used to the Move controller. I recommend a yoga mat and some space to move about. You can do most of the moves in a smaller space if you live in an apartment though. This game has realistic instructors to follow, fairly clear instructions, and lots of encouragement. There is a variety of goals to choose from which the game has specific classes to take to reach each goal. Once you reach a goal, you can choose another one. It doesn't take forever to reach a goal, which gives me a sense of accomplishment and desire to complete more goals. The classes are mostly between 5-15 minutes, so you can do several in a sitting if you want. I already feel like I am seeing results from doing this everyday.	2015-08-28

I'll take other reviewers word that the Batmobile is involved in 80% of the game.  I can't believe that the Batmobile is driven with a little bitty joystick on the game controller instead of the controller itself as in many actual driving games: Motor Storm to name just one.  Driving with the little bitty joystick totally ruined the game for me and I have no intention of wasting any more of my life becoming highly frustrated and aggravated over a stupid video game.  Also no instructions came with the game which is also frustrating.  Continually stopping the game to view the games 'controller' functions to see what set of buttons need to be used for any given function.  HORRIBLE!!!  DO NOT BUY.	2015-08-28

I hate to give this a three star because it was so perfectly made (to me), the weight, the touch, the feedback of the bottoms, not to my favorite camouflage, but still I had to return it, BECAUSE IT JUST DOES NOT WORK WITH PCS. It says &#34;wireless&#34; but it's only wireless for the XBOX 360 console, not for PCs. Then I had to buy another &#34;Play and Charging cable&#34; for it, since I figured it said &#34;Play&#34; too, right? Again, NO! It didn't work, when you hook up you controller with your PC using the cable, you will be able to find the driver installed on your computer in you device manager, but it just didn't work, and trust me, that is not the problem of my computer, I went to the Xbox official website, they did not say it won't work, and also did not say it will, and a lot of video game forums too, and it all turned out that some of the answers given on the FAQ part on this page is just misleading. Another way for it to work with your PC is you need to buy a wireless receiver to for your computer, and then I called all the Bestbuys and all the GameStops in town, and I got the same answer &#34;No, they just don't make that anymore&#34;. Here on Amazon, you can find a bunch of them, and none of them is original, all knock-offs. If you spend a lot of time, which I do not have the patience to, you might be able to find brand new original ones, for 30+ dollars. So, think about it.	2015-08-28

This adds intrigue in finding more out about them as the game progresses.<br />- The combat system was like nothing I've ever played before which was nice. It fallows the traditional turn based set up but its utterly in terms of which party members get to act first and even which skills you've unlocked for each can be used. In a sense you basically always have to make due with whatever you end up with which might sound bad when said aloud but it actually is rather fun ingame. Also during the middle of battles you can swap party members in and out with each other if you want. This actually will be key as some of the characters have elemental attacks that work best on various types of enemies.<br />- The game uses the traditional random encounter mechanic, where you'll be attack by monsters after you move around for a odd amount of time. However at least one of the characters can use a skill that scares monsters away for a set amount of time (this is helpful when your party is tired and needs to get back to the rest area without further complications. That much said another character has a skill that does the exact opposite using it will automatically trigger a battle (helpful when you're doing your standard RPG character level grinding as it save time having to walk around to attract attention).<br />- The mini games that are key to unlocking more of each character's skills and improving your relationship with them are interest, but be warned they are a tad bit lewd so if you're not comfortablewill doing so kinky stuff to girls of questionable ages I'd suggest you skip this game.<br />- Character Dialog is surprisingly well done for a game that was most likely banking on fan service.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The game can be unforgiving in fights in later areas to players who don't put in a lot of work leveling up all their party members and improving relationship levels with each as much as possible.<br />- The magic on the touch screen mini games might be lost on some players after the first few times and after that some players might just find it annoying.<br />- Having to use both the rear and front touch screens at the same time can be chore at best and nightmare at worst.<br />- Its really rare but some of the later mini games have been known to freeze the game due to how much they make your do at once.<br />- This might not be a con for everyone (personally I find it trivial) but there is no english audio only original Japanese at least not that I recall so get ready read all the dialog.<br /><br />Thats concludes my review, all and all its fun little game and bold release given how uptight Western media is about the sort of subject matter this game has a field day with outside of blatant porn but thats Western hypocrisy for you.	2015-08-28

You should have bought an X-Box One	Were you excited by all the new features and changes mentioned all over the Internet, in previews and reviews, in videos everywhere?<br /><br />Too bad.  You should have bought an X-Box One.<br /><br />There is no new scouting system in Madden 16 on the X-Box 360.  Instead, you get the new points (fewer points, losing points if you sim ahead without scouting every week), but you get the old system with a bonus (I mean, other than the lack of points making it hard to skim the surface of a tiny number of players): It's bugged.  Every player shows Strength as &#34;fully scouted&#34; with a 0.  Which is just the kind of thing that really helps you figure out which offensive or defensive lineman you want to select!<br /><br />The new passing style might be there, but it's hard to tell at times, when passes seem to go anywhere but where you wanted them to.  There is a tutorial on it, though.<br /><br />Draft Champions is there, and that at least seems like an interesting way to play the game.  Is it worth $60 (or $70 for Deluxe Edition)?  Not at all.<br /><br />It's one thing to see minor changes from edition to edition with Madden.  We get that.  They remove features because it's easier to do that than develop them, or they can add them back later and pretend they're new (like owner mode).  But having an edition of the game where they manage to break more than they add while simultaneously having the &#34;same&#34; edition on another system with a lot more features?  We're getting into new territory here.<br /><br />If you have a 360, you've just been told you're an afterthought by EA.  Make them an afterthought in your own mind.  Don't buy this game on X-Box 360.	2015-08-28

I loved the historical aspects and the graphics and the combat and collecting.  If you like any of the following games you should like this because they are all the same game in a different skin:<br />- the Assassins Creed series<br />- the Batman Arkham series<br />- Shadow of Mordor<br />- Far Cry 3 & 4 (same but in 1st person)<br />The formula is...climb towers to reveal collectibles in the area; explore the map to collect, buy, and upgrade your skills/equipment; level up to where you can complete the core story and inevitable boss battles.  It breaks down like this timewise: 10% main story, 20% side mission stories, 70% exploring, collecting, buying, and upgrading.  I like all these games, but taking a break after this one.  On a positive note, this one minimizes the sci-fi thing and lets you stay in the historical immersion except for some voiceover from Abstergo Control and a couple of time-slip sub-missions.  I learned a lot about the French Revolution because of trying to solve the Nostrodamus-speak riddles with the clues buried in the encyclopedia entries that you collect.  The combat is brutal and graphic and surprisingly customized to your weapon of choice.	2015-08-28

Though I have not used a knife or anything against it, it feels pretty nice. It is very smooth to the touch compared to film screen protectors. It comes in a hard plastic case with some white foam pouch like thing to protect it from damages while in the case. I had zero 'bubbles' under the glass though I doubt you would notice if there was one, wiped the screen with the provided cloth and carefully placed it on and watched the 'wave' of air disappear until the corner where you need to push it a bit. Looks exactly like their screenshot at the time though mine looks a bit more clear.  The back film was difficult as there was only a Tab with a 2 on it and no 1 which was odd.  You peel the film off the larger plastic and then place it on. Although no bubbles on the main touch area, I did have some on the sides though it wouldn't really matter. I use the [[ASIN:B00KE6DCFU dreamGEAR Comfort Grip for PlayStation Vita Slim (PCH-2000)]] around it and it looks great.	2015-08-28

My rating may change over time, but for now here's my first impressions....<br /><br />Ratings typically are made by first impressions and as with previous years, I'm finding my first impression with the Madden NFL videogame experience is being ruined by having to sit through forced demos and lessons on what has changed and how I now need to play Madden with the new features.  This of course comes *after* struggling just to get the game to install completely as the first effort at installing got me to a &#34;Ready to Start&#34; that was then met with a &#34;This game needs an update&#34; before I could really start the game.  That took me through a loop of uninstalling the game which hadn't completely installed back through several attempts to get the game to completely install only to be met with &#34;There was an error installing...&#34; that could either have me Retry or Cancel the installation process.<br /><br />When I finally was able to complete the install (patience is definitely key as the process is slow and takes several minutes to get through (more like 15 - 20 minutes total) and actually start the game, I was, as noted, forced to sit through a intro story/movie that gives me a chance to hit a few buttons in key points to complete the play that was automatically called.  There is no way to exit that 'demo' that I could find, so again patience is required to sit back and get ready to actually play the game or enter the code that you might have to get you some additional content.  Once I did complete the opening story, I was then forced into yet more lessons of what has changed in the game or how to play the game, again with no way to exit to the main menu.  Seriously, EA (or their programmers) are that insistent that I have to sit through classes in how to play the game before they'll let me go to the main menu?  You can't offer say a &#34;Learn to play the game&#34; tutorial as a menu choice that would be available (but not forced upon the gamer) at the gamer's choice, rather you have to force the gamers into these tutorials as if they are totally incompetent at just putting the game in and starting to play?<br /><br />As a co-worker and I discussed about this, what happened to the good old days when you could just put the game in and hit the start button?  If the game is really that complex that it requires training and the training is really that different from one year to the next then something is fairly obviously wrong.  Perhaps the developers/publisher need to go back to the drawing board to remove some of the complexity and put back the fun that has been drained away thanks to these experiences.<br /><br />With that all said, I'm sure that fans of the game will love it and will likely trash my comments and call me a H8er.  The game has its fans and it certainly is continuing to be tweaked graphically as it has become one of the more realistic portrayals of athletes in a virtual environment.  It does look really nice, complete with a lot of serious eye candy.  The question is just how frustrated will you be trying to get to the point that you can just play one game?  Once you do get to that point you may find the time you had available to sit and play a quick game has already passed.gamer's choice, rather you have to force the gamers into these tutorials as if they are totally incompetent at just putting the game in and starting to play?<br /><br />As a co-worker and I discussed about this, what happened to the good old days when you could just put the game in and hit the start button?

I only play CFM and CFM is broken in Madden 16. Google it, EA is telling customers to wait before starting their CFM due to bugs.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that CFM is broken in Madden 16, there really are no improvements to CFM that make this game worth upgrading. Relocation is same as last year, there are no new GM type features such as the ability to trade more than 3 of players/draft picks, etc. Just about the only thing new is the menus which I actually don't like as much in M16. Graphics are good but barely improved from last year if at all.<br /><br />It's too bad the NFL doesn't realize that competition would create a better football sim gaming experience for all. Instead we are left with minor updates and broken games.<br /><br />All in all, this game is not worth upgrading to if you own M15.  If you don't own 15 and want the newest version, wait until EA fixes CFM.	2015-08-28

What first started life as a Playstation Move game on the PS3, Until Dawn never released in that form and was instead scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up for the PS4 to emulate the style of game that developer Quantic Dream has been making for years now, namely Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. However, unlike those titles, Until Dawn is a horror game. It's hard to find a direct comparison in video games when it comes to this style of horror. Many people might not have played it, but the closest thing I'd compare it to in terms of a horror game is Obscure from the 6th console generation. That was a teen horror game with all of the tropes that come with the genre. So if you've played Obscure, think of a better version of that married with Heavy Rain.<br /><br />In terms of gameplay, again, the closest comparison is Heavy Rain. You are exploring environments, finding clues, doing quick-time events during action scenes -- and these are done extremely well in this game and far more varied than in other games that offer them, etc. The gameplay is tied directly to the narrative to make it a cinematic and seamless experience. This isn't a game where you're just doing meaningless actions to pad a game's length, but each action services the storytelling.<br /><br />Graphically, Until Dawn is one of the best looking games out there. As someone who has all 3 current generation consoles, I haven't played many games on par with Until Dawn. Running on the Killzone: Shadow Fall engine, an engine capable of producing beautiful visuals, Until Dawn is a looker. However, that doesn't mean it's perfect as the framerate can chunk up in some areas, but these small issues are few & far between and it doesn't really tarnish the game's brilliance. Character model wise, these are some of the most detailed character models in any game, and these characters feel like real people, warts & all.<br /><br />In terms of being a horror game, Until Dawn isn't the scariest game you'll play -- it's a fun, campy, teen slasher -- but it still offers plenty of scares. So if you're a bit of a wimp when it comes to horror, don't worry. It's scary but not overly gross or terrifying.<br /><br />Please, please, please, if you have any interest in this game, pick it up. Remember, if you buy something and support it, it's more likely that we'll see more titles like this. If we don't support them, however, we won't, and that would be a shame. This is Supermassive Games debut, it's an interesting new IP, and it needs our support.<br /><br />To any employees of Supermassive Games: If you read this, thank you for the wonderful game that has been a treat for my spouse and I to experience together.ers feel like real people, warts & all.<br /><br />In terms of being a horror game, Until Dawn isn't the scariest game you'll play -- it's a fun, campy, teen slasher -- but it still offers plenty of scares.

But in less than 2 months the #5 button stopped working. It was Purchased from B&H Photo and they only have a 30 day return so I was left to the people at Thrustmaster. They made me do the same thing as in downloading custom drivers, video me trying the joystick out and showing both the stick and screen that its not being used. Then after 3 days they come back and say I should cut the USB cable and send them a picture of it before they will send me a replacement. This is horrible Customer Service. I will also never buy a Thrustmaster or anything from B&H again! I'm happy to say I have just put in an order for a Saitek X55 Rhino Pro and this time trough Amazon. Even with it though I sprung for the 2 year replacement plan for an extra $9. Seems worth the Money to avoid hassles like this in the future.	2015-08-28

I bought this stand for the main purpose of cooling my ps4. I do a lot of gaming and my system gets pretty hot with the fan running at full speed most of the time. I was skeptical that this stand would adequately cool my system and I was right, as far as i can tell it doesn't work at all to keeping my system cool. I still have to use a separate fan on my system. Other than that everything works, the controller changing ports work the USB ports work. So if you are looking for a good fan to cool your system look elsewhere.	2015-08-28

The game was better than expected and had I been more enamored with the included digital content I may rated this collector's edition higher.

The Scroll wheel itself has a great feel to it and solid click<br />-Software - completely custom - can change DPI settings, color of logo, breathing rate, button settings, click and scroll speed, etc<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Even though this is ergonomic, it feels like it was made for Left handed people (I am right handed). This may be because I have more of a claw type grip instead of palm, but it &#34;feels&#34; more natural if I hold it in my left hand. Not really a con, but something to note - and not something to take a star away.<br /><br />Really a great Anker product. I have become a big fan of this company's products - from USB chargers to my iphone case to portable battery packs and now this mouse. They are all very well packaged and user friendly.<br />Their promo codes and sales are icing allowing you to get a huge bang for your buck.<br />Quality product, definitely recommend this mouse to those looking to branch our from the norm and want something with some customization on it without breaking the bank	2015-08-28

The game has Online Multiplayer and 4 player Co-Op featuring the use of drop-in/drop-out, offline/online gameplay. The game mainly focuses on this cooperative play.[8] Teammates can work together, even using weapons between players. Players can take control of Ratchet, Clank, Captain Qwark, and Dr. Nefarious. It was released on October 18, 2011.<br /><br />In Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One, Ratchet and Clank retire from their adventures as superheroes after the election of Captain Quark as the Galactic President. Dr. Nefarious tricks him into going to Luminopolis by telling him that he would have gotten a prize for his heroic acts. Quark invites Ratchet and Clank to come with him and, after arriving, they discover the ruse, but Dr. Nefarious brings a Light-Eating Z'Grute back to life. The Light-Eating Z'Grute gets out of Nefarious' control, however, and they all work together to stop it. After killing the Light-Eating Z'Grute, they get captured by a mysterious drone, but they break free thanks to a little Tharpod girl called Susie. After escaping, they realize they are on an unknown planet and that if they want to get back home, they will have to cooperate.	2015-08-28

These headphones are not made well at all. I can speak from experience because both my kids have them and have been through 3 pairs each. The functionality and sound are definitely great.The craftsmanship however here sucks. If you don't treat them like they're made of fine china then they will quickly degrade and break. The real problem is taking them on and off by pulling them outward away from the ears. This is because there is a real weak spot in the sides where the pivot hinge is. The plastic around the steel pins breaks and then it's all over. After buying two replacement pairs I smartened up and bought the replacement plan at Best Buy. Now I bring them back every few months for a new pair. That's the only way to own these. Seriously. I've attached photos to show the nature of the problem. Stay away. Just not worth your hard earned money.	2015-08-28

The controller doesn't lock into the tray but rests on it. It seems like the PS4 controller was designed specifically for this type of charger.<br /><br />The stand up chargers I've used stopped working because of plastic failure.

I've played the first one, and I must say that this game is a vast improvement in so many ways! The controls and gameplay feel a lot more fluid, the sheer amount of weapons and items is impressive, and there's so much variety to be had that replay value is phenomenal! As vague as all this is, if you've played the first and enjoyed it, I highly recommend this. If you've played Dark Souls II and are curious is this enhancement is worth it, I have friends who have played it and will agree that it is a vast improvement and, with the addition of all DLC, say that this is well worth the price. If you're new to Dark Souls and wish to jump in here, I say this is as good a spot as any if you don't have any interesting in playing the first. The lore remains the same, but the story isn't connected (contradiction? you bet!) so you won't be missing much if you're just heading in.<br /><br />TL;DR -- Great game that's worth the price for new and returning players (DS1 & DS2).	2015-08-28

I bought this for my SNES and it is significant improvement over composite, but like a few others have noted, there is &#34;checkerboarding&#34; or &#34;screen dooring&#34; whatever you want to call it, which shows that these are not high quality S-video cables.  If you want high quality S-video you're going to have to spend more on a Monster S-Video cable or a Japanese import. If you're looking for a good cable for SNES, I would forget S-video and RGB (which is a hassle and expensive), and wait for the component cables from HD Retrovision to come out.  EDIT: I was very wrong in my review. What I was talking about when I mentioned &#34;checkerboarding&#34; and &#34;screen dooring&#34; were actually scanlines, which are completely normal on CRT TV's with svideo. The cable I received from &#34;ztnetstore&#34; did not have any &#34;screen dooring&#34; whatsoever.	2015-08-28

I was blown away by the graphics and I like this Far Cry even better than FC3.  Spectacular scenery and outdoor sounds that I just wanted to immerse in.  It does follow a formula seen in other Far Cry games, but that is ok with me.  This is some of gaming's best AI for making you feel like you are really being hunted down by pursuers.  This is Ubisoft, so there are lots of drug trips to Shangrila if you choose to do the side missions.  Those scenes are spectacularly beautiful, but the gameplay there is so frantic you can hardly take it in.  The only thing I did not love was the ending with the procedural boss battle.  Voice acting is Hollywood quality.  Watch out for the freakin rhinos--they don't give up once riled.  :)	2015-08-28

It is also known as Ratchet & Clank: Quest for Booty in most PAL regions and as Ratchet & Clank Future Gaiden: Kaizoku Dark Water no Hihou in Japan.<br /><br />Taking place where Tools of Destruction left off, the game focuses on Ratchet and Talwyn's search for Clank. After a number of encounters with the pirates introduced in Tools of Destruction, they finally manage to activate a device called the Obsidian Eye that allows communication with the Zoni. However, the machine can not be activated without a reusable black hole frozen in furion crystal, named the Fulcrum Star. Rusty Pete revives the dead pirates and gives Slag a new body. After Ratchet defeats Darkwater/Slag, he and Talwyn obtain the Fulcrum Star. Ratchet then activates the Obsidian Eye, and learns Clank's fate: the Zoni have him in a strange new place, where he is malfunctioning. The Zoni reveal that they have hired Dr. Nefarious to repair Clank. Ratchet sets off to rescue Clank, and the story ends with Rusty Pete narrating to the head of Slag, which survived the destruction of Darkwater.	2015-08-28

Vendra's twin brother Neftin Prog, along with hired thugs from Thugs-4-Less, stages a jailbreak and frees her. Vendra activates the Nebulox's self-destruct sequence, escaping with Neftin while Ratchet and Clank are flung into space, unable to save Cronk and Zephyr. Ratchet and Clank pursue the twins throughout the galaxy, seeking revenge for their fallen comrades.<br /><br />This installment introduced gravity-based platforming and gameplay, as well as 2D puzzle sequences involving Clank in the Netherverse, a focal point of the game's plot.	2015-08-28

Picked these up straight from the Allure website.<br /><br />This particular model, the CODG4 has definitely gotten close to being the best pair of glasses I have found so far. I have about $300 worth of Gunnar's, a handful of the Gamma Ray glasses, a noscope (fake computer glasses, avoid) and another Allure model (broke, cheaply made).<br /><br />Pros<br />The quality of the frame is fantastic, it contours nicely around the eyes. Look good wearing them, which is a rarity with these types of glasses. Extremely lightweight.<br /><br />Cons<br />Lens quality is questionable, where most glasses feel smooth when wiping with a microfiber cloth...these feel rough. Could just be the coating applied to the surface. The coloration of the lens is still a bit more orange than the competition. (Gamma Ray, the cheapest on amazon, actually has the best tint so far, color looks correct).<br /><br />This is worth the cost. Well done Allure, please keep up with this kind of form factor and if you can upgrade the lens quality as well as reduce the tint... I would gladly pay even more for that what these are going for now.<br /><br />NOTE: The sleeve the glasses came with was not the one pictured above, but for an older pair they had featuring Black Ops 2.	2015-08-28

The game itself is pretty fun, especially for date night or family time.  There are several games within the game that are pretty good at instilling activity and fun with the Kinect.  My only real complaint with it (and it might be a Kinect issue) is that it isn't real responsive to your movements.  Such as the climbing game will often fail as you reach up outside of the view of the Kinect and it can't see you grab the handholds or the bowling game sometimes gets confused and you can't grab the ball or it goes wild when you throw it.	2015-08-28

I like the new way you get to pick how the receiver catches the ball and how if you pay as the tackle on defense you gotta time the buttons right and you'll get a sack.  I always thought MUT was and awesome contribution to madden,  and I'm sure that the Draft Champions mode is good too.  The franchise mode allows you to gain experience through playing for your team.  It's just a great overall football experience with very few flaws.	2015-08-28

This indicated the planned release date for the next installment of the series. Ratchet continues his search for Clank, Dr. Nefarious returns as an antagonist (primary or otherwise), and the game goes into more depth about what happened to the Lombaxes.<br /><br />The story and player's perspective alternates between Ratchet and Clank; Clank's side of the story involves him fixing time at the Great Clock, as well as learning to fulfill his destined role as the Great Clock's senior caretaker. Clank also learns that a Zoni named Orvus had created his soul. Ratchet's part in the story includes meeting another Lombax named General Alister Azimuth, an elder who turns out to be unintentionally responsible for their kind's downfall as he allowed Tachyon to use the Lombaxes' technology, and is intent on taking control of the Great Clock to rectify his mistakes. Qwark also assists Ratchet during the storyline and eventually goes alone to gather useful information for Ratchet.	2015-08-28

As soon as the update downloaded & installed itself, I got a gamepad error code 165-6596.  Googled it and found many others encountering the same exact problem as a result of this game.  Called Nintendo and they're trying to tell me my gamepad is broken and they want $99 to fix it.  Ummmm, if it's broken then how come it still works just fine with ALL of my other games?  This is ridiculous.  I've owned every console Nintendo has ever released, and I never had a problem with ANY of them…until now.  If Nintendo's game/update is causing gamepad issues for people, they need to take responsibility for it rather than using it as an opportunity to extort more money out of their loyal customers.  I certainly regret purchasing this game, as I can't even play it!	2015-08-28

If your like me and found yourself with the gummies on your PS4 broken and starting to crack look no further. These are the best ones I have found and I have tried a lot of them.  Only one problem is that getting those lil suckers on is time intensive.  What i found best to maximize them was the cut off the old original gummies from the PS4 off (be careful doing this) and put these guys on the now-bare plastic joysticks.  I've used this controller at least 15+ hrs a day sometimes and they still haven't let up.  Great thing is you get 3 pairs so you can give a pair to your friend if he needs em too. Great product.	2015-08-28

US	52965580	R2NQS5JABLWXNO	B00SXEOMWW	281669131	LEGO Jurassic Parent	Video Games	3	6	8	N	Y	Really Buggy	I bought this game to play with my eight year old grandson.  We have an XBox 360 as well as a Wii U, and I chose the Wii U version so we don't have to play split screen, which I find really annoying.<br /><br />I've played many other Lego video games, and this one works pretty much the same as the others.  The only unique aspect is that you can play as a dinosaur.  There also seems to be a lot more running around looking for things and less fighting with other characters than in the other Lego games (although you do have to knock out some pesky dinosaurs at times).  I found it kind of confusing figuring out how to get to all the parks, but that could just be me.<br /><br />My main complaint is the amount of bugs in this game, which really should have been taken care of before it was released. It completely froze several times during play.  Sometimes when you are playing a one player game, the other character just randomly changes on his own to another character or a dinosaur.  I was playing as T Rex when he got stuck inside a wall.  I found trying to make Billy Brennan glide to be very frustrating  Sometimes he would just not open his parachute, even though I was controlling him correctly.  Velociraptor can jump and pull bars, but you have to stand in just the right place to make this work, which can take a long time to find.<br /><br />Another quirk is that in many places you need to be a dinosaur to accomplish certain actions.  In Free Play mode, if you're standing too close to where you need to change to a dinosaur, you cannot switch to the dinosaur character.  You need to move some distance away.  Why?<br /><br />This is my least favorite Lego video game.  I would recommend waiting until the price drops to about $19.99 before buying, which shouldn't take too long.  Maybe they will fix some of the bugs by then.	2015-08-28

Started all the way back in 2008 as the successor to the long running Super Robot Wars Alpha, Z had some big honking galoshes to fill and looking back on it I think it did a good job. Z stumbled a little with some of Z2's decisions, and the decision to release on both portable and console has definitely constrained Banpresto, and there's some generally deserved grumbling about some of Banpresto's decisions vis a vis series and unit availabilities in this game, but at the end of the day Z3.2 is a worthy finale to this multiverse spanning Super Robot War.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is the big one. Z3 Tengoku starts right at the ending of the previous Z3 game: Hibiki and the other heroes of Z-BLUE have won their final battles and have gathered to witness the end of the Time Prison on the Earth, and discover that a second Earth hanging in the sky over their world. However both their reverie and their confusion is short lived when the main forces of Sidereal arrive to invade the Earth having decided the time for subtly is at an end. With no pause for rest our heroes are once again caught in a massive conflict to decide the fate of not only the Earth but the very future of existence. There's barely a year left until the end of the universe, and arrayed against Z-BLUE are not only Sidereal but Amalgam, Neo Zeon, the Baal, the Gods of universes past, and of course the &#34;Angel&#34; that Hibiki has been ceaselessly pursuing. Along the way the 12 spheres will finally be gathered, the story of Asakim Doan will be told, the truth behind The Edel will be revealed, a reckoning will arrive for gods and for the people who would become them. The end of the universe is coming, and it's going to go out with a bang.<br /><br />If you've played a Super Robot Wars game made since the DS came out then Z3.2 will be a familiar experience. The fundamentals of the game remain the same, it's a Turn Based RPG with a linear progression of stages using a grid where you move your units and attack to fight your foes. It's Fire Emblem if Fire Emblem had giant robots instead of fantasy character. As usual for non-OG games the bulk of you army is culled from quite an array of Giant Robot anime series and the full cast list is an impressive who's who of giant robot anime from the 70s up till the modern day.<br /><br />All of the standard gameplay mechanics of Super Robot Wars are here as well. All your pilots have their own Spirit Commands akin to magic which they can use to boost themselves or others in nearly any aspect. Pilots also have a Morale rating that rises over the course of battle, boosting their stats, unlocking more powerful attacks, and for some units enabling or automatically triggering super modes or other abilities. Both pilots and the giant robots they fly can be upgraded and developed, improving stats or learning new skills to make them more effective. Like many console releases Tengoku-hen has a dynamic difficulty: there's a bonus objective for every stage (and unlike previous games these can be downright nasty) and depending on how many you earn the game's difficulty changes. Get most of them and you'll play in hard mode, get almost none and you'll play in easy mode, in between lands in Normal mode. And of course there are secret units and characters, not as many as a game like UX but still a handful of people you can recruit or save, and a few snazzy mechs you can get your hands on (Including the only playable version of the Alpha Azieru to date).<br /><br />Tengoku-Hen uses a polished variant of Jigoku-hen's various systems. Like Jigoku you assign 2-unit squads for your characters, with one unit as a main and the other as a supporter that can provide covering fire and more. Also like in Jigoku you can earn Tag Tension stars, and cash them in for an explosive Maximum Break or a special tag command. New to Tengoku is a 5th Tag Command, Boost Dash which gives you a significant movement boost and lets you pass through enemies for one turn. The tactical combo system also returns, your combo rating raises whenever you wipe out an enemy squad, boosting damage and rewards, but drops every time you launch an attack that isn't a cleansweep. Thankfully unlike Jigoku your combo rating ONLY declines if you launch an attack, merely moving a unit does not penalize you anymore. Lastly the AG's Z-Chip shop returns with a larger inventory of ultra-powerful optional parts, but instead of buying passive, global boosts from the shop you get them by investing Z-Chips in your Z-Crystal.<br /><br />And of course the graphics. As usual Banpresto does a smashing job in terms of animation. Super Robot Wars still has some of the prettiest spritework I've ever seen, where units and attacks have an excellent level of design and detail. The previous 3 Z series protagonists, Rand, Setsuko, and Crowe all return with extremely pretty upgraded units. The animation is excellent across the board, and special work is once again done to capture the style of the myriad series that are included in the game.<br /><br />So what's less exciting? Well the balance overall is pretty good, but you get SO MANY units you often you can't even deploy half your roster in any given stage. This means that even a lot of mid-tier units like the Diebuster era Buster Machines or a good number of Mobile Suits simply get edged out by really excellent units like the new Sphere Reactor units or old favorites like Chirico's Scopedog or the Shin Getter Robo. It also doesn't bode very well for units that require investment like Daiguard, and even the newly debuting Chamber can get left in the dust by the stampede of great robots. This massive roster also leads to some frustrating decisions on unit availability. Relegating some characters to only being summon attacks in Z2 were a bit divisive but at least they were things like Sochie and her Capool or the other Silhouette engines in Sara's squad, but in Z3 some fairly major units like the Legend and Infinity Justice Gundams are relegated only to being summoned by attacks. Even more frustrating was the decision to put Toby and Denzel, Xine, and Marguerite from the previous Z games as an attack on a battleship, If they aren't going to be available as fully playable units at the very least they probably should have appeared with Setsuko, Rand, and Crowe respectively.<br /><br />Going along with the roster issue the choices for which series to use and bring back also feel a little off. Turn A Gundam and Gundam X return, but King Gainer is gone despite characters of those three series hanging out quite often in Z1 and 2. Similarly Gravion remains gone despite the Gravion plotline not having actually finished back in Z2 (Poor Eiji, he never did find out about his sister). Zambot 3 and Daitarn 3 return, but Daitarn 3 has little to do but be in a combination attack and the return of Gaizock from Zambot 3 feels weird and superfluous, Gaizock had a perfectly fine death so his return and attempted reintegration into the plot feels forced. The return of the original Aquarion to appear alongside Aquarion EVOL also feels a little unnecessary, and then weird when the game reveals that the first Aquarion has retconned out of Z2 (and the bonus stage of Z1) for some reason. Possibly most galling is the lack of any Eureka 7 series, after being so important in Z1 and Z2 not having either the original or AO for any of the Z3 games feels strange. Lastly despite a lot of build up for it there is no original Shin Mazinkaiser. If ever there was a game that deserved to be graced with Banpresto's most famous creation it was this one.<br /><br />At the end of the day however all these complaints feel sort of like nitpicking. The game is good, great even. Z3.2 is a worthy finale on par if not better than its predecessors like F Final and Alpha 3. The gameplay flows well, the mechanics remain good, the roster is huge and varied, the cast is used well, and after five massive wars Tengoku-hen offers a satisfying conclusion to the ongoing saga.<br /><br />See you next time Banpresto.	2015-08-28

I bought this for the Glow-in-the-Dark Cynder and the special Pop-Fizz. Delivery was quick and they are both compatible with my Wii U's SWAP-Force game.<br /><br />The Glow-in-the Dark Cynder is a little stronger than Series One Cynder and plus, it glows in the Dark. Have yet to play as Pop-Fizz in SWAP-Force on my Wii U, but I logged him in and he is pretty interesting, personality-wise. I kind of like him as he reminds me of the Hulk/Bruce Banner.<br /><br />If you are looking to expand your Skylanders collection with two extra versions of the characters, this is a worthwhile investment.	2015-08-28

I personally love the click up to store and click down to charge, I'm the type of person who can't leave a phone plugged in at 100% or even leave the charger in the wall be itself. I don't think I'm OCD... It just erks me... The LEDs look pretty cool too so no hate on them. They aren't as bright as I thought they might be which is good.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it does seem a bit cheap. I don't know how long the click will stay strong or the batteries will last. At least as being new I know the batteries last longer than a 6 hour gaming session. That's about my max on a weekend and I have had no issues with the batteries needing charged mid play. Only time will tell as to there life span, but everything dies eventually. For &#60;$25 I'm ok with that. (I got a charge cable just in case it was ever necessary for &#60;$8. Doubt I'll ever need it...)<br /><br />Lastly I would like to inquire about this struggle to place the controller on charge...? The stand has a little nub that fits perfectly into the Mic usb port on the controller... you just sit your controller on that nub and lean it back, then, click down to charge... I've have to have tried this 100 times already just to see what these reviewer were talking about... I just don't see it... It works flawlessly every time!	2015-08-28

I also haven't followed wrestling for awhile. My son watches a few of the programs each week, but most of what I saw wasn't very interesting. I grew up with the 80s Saturday night wrestling shows with Gordon Solie as announcer, Sunday was WWF/E and even rented the VHS of Wrestlemania I just a few months after it originally happened. I really loved wrestling. Our son is back and forth with it. So there's really not been a reason to buy the games. I hadn't realized 2K had taken over the WWE series until a few weeks ago. That, if nothing else, made me interested in the game since I believe 2K still has developed the best NFL game ever ... in NFL 2K5. And I've enjoyed several of the more current NBA 2K games.<br /><br />The roster had very little impact on my choice of which WWE game to get. Despite being a fan during the 80s and through the Attitude Era, I'm not really into using the wrestlers from those eras, especially those who've passed away. I was more interested in having a fun game. Everything I read on wrestling games forums said 2K14 is better than 2K15, so I ordered a used version, not knowing I would need to buy an online pass since the one included was used by the previous owner.<br /><br />So, I ended up paying ten more dollars for an online pass. Then ended up buying the Season Pass which was another twenty dollars. I really didn't mind the price since I figured it would be enough to last my wrestling game interest for a few years. The game is good, but it's really not that different than I remember the THQ WWE games being. It's a reversal-fest. I ended up lowering the reversal slider all the way down to just one level of it. It was pretty annoying to hit a finisher, pick the guy up and have him reverse your next move. There's plenty of match types to play. And though the roster didn't matter much to me in the beginning, it started to matter once I played the game. I ended up going to the community creations and downloading roughly 90 created wrestlers since there's a lot of active wrestlers not in this game. I would think most notably for current WWE fans, The Wyatt Family. There's some really great created wrestlers in the community creations.<br /><br />We played it off and on for a week or so, but the roster, even with added created wrestlers, just isn't very good. The best created wrestlers don't look much better than the worst default characters. I would rate this higher, but I turned around and bought a new copy of WWE 2K15 for the 360 and liked it quite a bit better. I wouldn't rate either one a five star. There's problems in these games that were around back in 2010. From collision detection, floating wrestlers, a very ambitious &#34;create a finisher&#34; that ends up making you think they really don't put much time into it. Create a Story isn't any better than I remember it being. It more or less reminds me of most sports video games. They update the roster, throw a few new animations in and say it's a new game. I'm also going to review 2K15 as well. A quick ending piece of advice. Only buy used if you're willing to pay the money for the online access which you have to have to download created wrestlers. You also have to have Xbox Gold. I tried a free trial week to the online access only to find out it wouldn't let me download any created wrestlers during the trial. If you buy a new copy it will come with the online access code. One last warning on this one. The server has been having problems for the last 2 weeks. I spent a week trying to download a Great Muta created wrestler only to receive this message, &#34;The WWE 2K14 service is not available. Try again later.&#34; From what I've read they'll most likely shut the server down in the next few months anyway.reations and downloading roughly 90 created wrestlers since there's a lot of active wrestlers not in this game.

The problem is this one edition. This is not a remaster as much as a port. There are zero gameplay changes and few graphical improvements over the PS3 version. More importantly, it is slightly worse than Dishonored GOTY for PC, which has FAR better graphics, better load times, and no glitches. The PS4 version looks sharp, and if you don't have a med-high end PC (and have the patience to put up with the load times...) you'll enjoy it because it's a great game that still looks awesome. But for anyone else this is a huge waste of money at either $20 or $40. Consider buying the GOTY edition for PC for a mere $20 on Amazon or $30 on Steam: it will look as good as the PS4 edition with just a mid-tier graphics card.

My previous setup was as follows: - Astro 5.8 Mixamp (First gen) - Sennheiser PC360's  I purchased this MixAmp because my Astro 5.8 receiver's battery has degraded to the point where it is necessary to supply the receiver unit with USB power or else it would turn off instantly.  I could have just purchased a replacement battery; however, the wireless nature of the 5.8 MixAmp was not really necessary for my setup.  Moreover, from reading around, the MixAmp Pro allowed me to: - Play a game on Xbox, and also be able to pipe in music from my computer on top of the game sound/voice - I'm all about playing COD or Halo to some drum n' bass or breaks.  Unfortunately, when I received the MixAmp Pro, I was unable to resolve the &#34;robotic/muffled voice&#34; issue that so many people are pissed off about here.  So the MixAmp Pro sat in a box and over the past year, and for about 10 months, I slowly attempted to resolve the issue.  I tried everything from replacing the supplied USB cord (multiple times), replacing my 3.5mm/2.5mm cables, powering from a wall USB charger, running game audio through a Wyred4Sound DAC into a Schitt Magni amp, etc.  I tried every conceivable wire configuration and was unable to solve the muffled/robotic voice issue.  The last possible thing was replacing my headset - which I wasn't too keen on.  I read in a drop discussion on MassDrop that the Sennheiser GAME ONE's (and GAME ZERO's (if you'd prefer a closed headset)) had been quietly refreshed by Sennheiser to include a removable audio cable.  My PC 360's had seen better days and had served me well for the years I've had them, and so I decided that I would go ahead and upgrade based on the Game One's being available on MassDrop for a discounted price as well as MassDrop confirming that the version they were selling was the latest revision (i.e. it had the removable cable).  The headphones arrived today and included the standard Y connector that my PC360's had (to split audio and mic).  The GameOnes also included a cable that lacked the Y-splitter/connector and went straight to a standard 3.5mm jack.  Using standard 3.5mm jack, I plugged everything in as follows:  - Optical from Xbox One to MixAmp Pro optical input. - USB from Xbox One to MixAmp Pro (for power) - Turtle Beach &#34;talkback&#34; cable from first-gen Xbox One Controller with Headset Adapter output into MixAmp (note that there is a newer version of the Xbox One Controller - I do not have one so YMMV if you do).  Talkback cable is available here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KC9J1Z4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 - Sennheiser GameOne cable straight into MixAmp - using the &#34;Headphone to 3.5mm&#34; cable, not the split cable with a Y adapter I had been using previously with my PC360's.  And everything works as it should - robot voice issue has been eliminated.  The MixAmp does what I was hoping for (computer/ipod audio on top of  console game and voice audio) and I can finally retire my 5.8 MixAmp.  So the issue was really my previous headphones (PC360's) terminating in a Y-split and then using an adapter to bring those back together before plugging into the MixAmp Pro - for some reason the MixAmp Pro didn't like that adapter (or any of the multiple variations of the adapter that I tried).  Astro should be performing better troubleshooting for their customers, or at the very least, test for potential issues with a variety of interconnects and then resolve those issues before selling a product for $200+.  Customers shouldn't have to buy a specific headset  - with a cable that terminates in a specific way - in order to be able to use the MixAmp Pro in the way it is marketed and intended to be used.  Astro annoyed the heck out of me with this, and I wasted quite a bit of money to do the testing that they should have done before the product was released; so I'm giving 3/5 stars.  Hopefully this helps someone out.	2015-08-28

It was kind of annoying to have to purchase this separately to be able to use my headset with my older XBox One controller, but the functionality is excellent.  It took some figuring out how to make it isolate voice from the game sound, but you can do it and it works really well once you have it configured.  Once you know how to do that, you can easily switch it to listen to game sounds and remove the voice.  It fits nicely on the back of the controller and doesn't cause much trouble with it being in the way.	2015-08-28

I'm pretty much almost done with the game and i'm excited to play the bonus content that is only for those who pre-ordered it like me :D If I were to compare the scariness with this and Outlast. I'd have to say outlast is a bit more scarier. Until Dawn is that type of game where you panic because you never know if your decisions will end a character dead.. (some decisions have a timer) + the things you have to do especially the blue motion center.. it can pop up anytime when you're trying to hide from an enemy or just staying still.. there are some pop ups as well. anyone playing this in the future, i think you'll enjoy it because i'm having a blast playing this game.

Loved it on the 360 back when it came out.<br /><br />The remaster though? Still fantastic, and they did a great job, but I have a few complaints. In some scenes in the campaign, there is a bit of stuttering, pop-in, and delayed loading for objects in the game. It hasn't happened too much to make me want to give this game a 2-3 star review, but I figured it was worth noting. Also noticed some screen-tearing in the campaign.<br /><br />The online holds up beautifully, running at a solid 60fps with no hiccups. I find that strange, and wonder why the single player isn't as fluid.<br /><br />Other than that though, a fantastic remaster.	2015-08-28

This kit is an excellent replacment.  I chose this color because it never came to the US.  All the pieces worked and fit accordingly.  Warning: shell swapping or replacement is NOT easy.  If you are planning on attempting this be ready to watch youtube videos over and over.  Also, be patient.  It may take several sessions.  I had to step away several times.  This will help you not get frustrated, rush and accidentally break a ribbon cable(happened to me).  The shell looks very clean, the only thing I wish is that there would be a couple of extra parts for things like the lower screen border(hard to line up and can take a couple of attempts).  Otherwise this shell is excellent if you have a banged up shell or you just want a different color.	2015-08-28

This is an excellent mount for the Kinect, and we have found that it works much better when placed on top of the TV.  The bezel (the black trim that goes around the screen) of our TV is pretty narrow, and this still fits nicely without covering up the screen.  It fits snugly and securely, and I don't worry about it falling off the top of the TV (we have it mounted on the wall up a few feet so a fall from this height could be trouble).  The camera cover is a nice touch for the paranoid folks (like my wife) worrying about Kinect &#34;watching&#34; you all the time.  Of course, with all the &#34;Big Brother is watching&#34; updates to Windows 10, perhaps folks should be more wary about what is being broadcast with the Kinect.	2015-08-28

Much like the 3DS Giants Skylanders, I bought this for the Skylanders themselves and you get a good deal with it.

My favorite aspect of this game is the sound and cinematography. When you're walking down a snowy path, hearing footsteps in the snow, wind, trees, animals, and the camera changes to a view where someone on the hillside is watching your movements, and reacting by hiding, and heavily breathing, it really is an 80's horror film. Plenty of homage is paid to some classics as well. It's a &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; cinematic masterpiece. Some people may be upset that it isn't a &#34;game&#34; per se, but there's plenty of mechanics and exploration that are not QTE related. Really the fun lies in deciding who you want your characters to be, and playing them out as such.<br /><br />As I mentioned the sound earlier, that's where the real jump scares come from, and there's plenty. I really enjoyed the twists and scares, and if you have an open mind, you will too.<br /><br />I give it a 9 instead of a 10 because the movement can be slow sometimes (but not like Rapture), and you couldn't always make decisions that you feel your character would. There's usually only 2 choices, and some events could really benefit from more.	2015-08-28
