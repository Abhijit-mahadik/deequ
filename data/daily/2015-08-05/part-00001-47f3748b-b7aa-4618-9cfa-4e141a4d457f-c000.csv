I've had the black suede style for over two years. I wear them constantly (and they still look great). I just purchased an identical second pair, as when the first pair finally wear out, I doubt I will be able to find another shoe I love as much. I did purchase a half size up (as they do fit a bit small), but I'm sure if I had purchased my original size, they would have stretched/loosened enough over a short amount of time. Since mine were suede, I was sure to use the proper sprays/protection on them, or I'm almost certain they wouldn't have lasted as well as they have. I've paid double the price for other casual shoes, and considering how well these have lasted, I can say they are well worth every penny. I do get many compliments on these shoes (from both young and old). I'm looking to purchase a pair for my daughter now (she loved them as well). It's a good thing we don't take the same size, or I'm sure I would have lost my first pair to her long ago!	2015-08-05

They provide enough support with a heel that is just high enough for wearing them all day without looking frumpy.  I've received many compliments on them as well.  The only reason I didn't give these five stars is due to the fact that I feel that the straps need more Velcro.  I like the sandals to feel like they're well fastened around my ankle.  While they're not totally loose, I would like them a little tighter and more Velcro could help with that.	2015-08-05

Despite by comment that the fit is as expected, it took me four attempts to get the right size. but I wanted this shoe because of the width - I have wide feet and most smaller sizes only come in medium widths.  I normally wear a size 6.  I tried this at a store and deemed the size 6 a good fit.  I ordered from Amazon for a better price.  The size 6 came and there was a good inch of space beyond my toe and it felt too loose.  I returned the 6 and ordered a 5.5.  This was now too tight with my toe jammed at the end.  I opened a chat with Amazon and someone helped me get another 6 and he waived the overnight shipping fee.  Next day, I had the 6, tried it on and it was tight!  Having not returned the 5.5 yet, I compared the two and they were exactly the same length.  Got on the phone with Amazon this time and was again helped with another order for a 6 with overnight shipping waived.  Lo and behold, the fourth pair, and third size 6 fit!!  Despite all that, I'm glad I persisted because the shoes are very comfortable, great for walking which is really all I do in a pair of athletic shoes.	2015-08-05

I'm a huge Croc fan, these flip flops are my 6th pair of Croc shoes.  Comparing these to my other flip flops, I have to say I'm disappointed.  They aren't as soft and squishy as my other Croc shoes, and I don't feel as though these are as supportive.  They more or less feel like hard, cheap plastic on my feet.  Yes, they are very light, which is nice...nobody likes to clunk around in heavy sandals.  However, I don't feel as though the small benefit of weight is enough for me to ever consider reordering this particular shoe.  I did keep these, but only because I didn't have time to send them back.  I prefer some of the other styles that offer more cushion and support and will order those in the future instead.	2015-08-05

The materials are good, soft and comfortable on the skin. The design is pretty, especially the shape of the toe and gold-tone medal straps. As I have wide feet, I find them too narrow for me. As a result, I will have to pass on these., which is sad! I got a pair in size 8.5M (width: 3.25&#34;, length: 10-3/8&#34;); the width barely fit the ball of my feet, the straps around the vamp do not provide enough room, so it is constrictive to my toes, the length is quite long. I would not be able to down in size because the fit would just not work. Therefore, if you have narrow and slender feet, I think these might be for you.	2015-08-05

I found that the shoe has a lot of support but the toes and side of the shoe are awfully tight. After running 7-9 miles with these shoes my right hip started to bother me. I tried running with them a week later, same issue. And I also tried just walking with them to try and break them in more but now the shoe is just collecting dust. The support or arch is so high that it pushes your feet to the outside of the shoe and thus causing more pressure. And that pressure adds up after many miles with the shoe even from walking	2015-08-05

I like the glasses, they fit a little small &#34;lenses&#34;  the arms go pretty far back and keep the glasses  secured on your head. if you ride a bike this is nice. I like the tint of the lens but because the lens are a little to small the reading lens is up higher than I like. but all in all the make for a change in what you normally wear for reading sun glasses. the only other problem I had was one pair had a scratched lens right of the box. that's a shame to these things came all the way from china in record time.	2015-08-05

This will be my initial review, received the shoes yesterday and did a quick 2 mile run.<br />Reviews said that the shoe ran small, and because I usually wear a 4E and the shoe is only available in 2E I got a 9 1/2. It fits good enough not to return but I think I should have gone with a 9. For my wide footed bretheren the 2E is spacious enough for those of us who typically wear a 4E and I would not pass over this shoe because of the lack of a 4E option.<br /><br />The feel is great very cushiony, mind you I'm coming off of shoes that I went about 500 miles over the limit on. So, my opinion may be swayed.<br /><br />The feel is great, lots of control being wide footed I don't feel like I'm hanging over the edges.  Impacts feel consistent no matter how I land on the shoe which is something many complex running shoes lack.	2015-08-05

I have difficulty finding nice looking low arch work shoes, but this Deer Stags style allows me to walk comfortably all day, inside and out. Unfortunately, if you get caught in the rain, the life of this shoe is greatly diminished. The sole will separate. I buy these shoes in quantity because even with a shorter than regular wear life, it's the best fitting, most comfortable shoe I've found yet.	2015-08-05

This bag has long enough handles to pull up on your shoulder and it comes with a shoulder strap to wear on your shoulder or across your body. I love the color. It will be perfect for fall, and the canvas is sturdy. There are plenty of pockets, and the inside is quite roomy.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.

I wanted something stylish and lightweight to pack for an extended trip.  These fit the bill perfectly.  I used them as dress shoes under pants, which was not perfect, but they also did not stick out as much as wearing full sneakers would have. The ridged bottoms are not overly obtrusive and so it does not look as if you are walking around in sneakers, even for those of us with large feet (I'm a 8 to 9).<br /> I also used them for day to day site seeing.  They seemed to offer the same comfort as my athletic shoes in terms of extended walking around. They pack nicely and came back to their full shape easily even after being squished in an overly packed suitcase for almost 24 hours.<br />However, these can't substitute for athletic shoes if you want to engage in fitness walking or running.  I tried both, and there is not enough support.  I did not think there would be, but it was worth a try.<br />I liked these so much that I purchased two additional pairs on my trip in other colors.	2015-08-05

The height of the shaft worked well on my 5' figure and zipped somewhat snugly over my calves over pants. I wear a 5.5 or a 6 in this brand, but I ordered a 7, knowing boots usually run small for whatever reason. The foot and width felt fine, but I think the arch support is lacking. My foot kept falling towards the center of the boot. Also, the top of the boot facing away from the center of my body stood a good 2 inches away from my leg, yet the top of the boot sitting against the inner side of my knee dug in. Returned.	2015-08-05

Nike Luna Gato , Adidas Modial turf whiich was great but after A5 years fell apart, Asic Dx light hard ground cleats all time favorite and Asics Copero which blow away these Oumas in every front.<br />The fit is fine but trust me if you.are used to high end leather or even synthetic shoes you will be disappointed. Thin , stiff and very little padding . I own many Puma running shoes and love the brand but these look and feel like $39/shoes.<br />Should have trusted my instinct and went with the Kings.	2015-08-05

I always wear an 8, and that is what I ordered. Fit true to size. And the price for these is insane. A boot comparable to this this would surely be triple the price. I think I found a new brand of boots in CAT. How did I not know about this brand sooner? In fact I bought another boot by them at the same time as these and am equally impressed. A+!	2015-08-05

The collar around the shoe is what feels snug, on the slightly small size for my 9.5 foot size and me ordering a 41. I believe that is to keep the shoe on the foot better and not fly off while walking. I have not had the chance to wear them all day yet, so that is likely to stretch some.

I am not sure what rating to give these.  On one hand, they are really, really good at what they are supposed to do - reduce fatigue.  I have these soles in a pair of construction work boots, and I can stand for longer amounts of time than I can in any other shoes, including sneakers.  On the other hand, they are pretty thick, especially in the heels, and don't really fit into any shoes other than big work boots.  They really change the way shoes fit.  I have pretty thick feet, which might contribute to this phenomenon, but it is something to consider before buying them.	2015-08-05

I bought them in December, posted an awesome review in March. I work in a factory that recaps over 200 semi tires a day. So I take care of 2 60,000sq ft shops by my self. The other shop refurbishs semi trailers. So I walk on concrete all day. I wear a pedometer and I average 5-7 miles a day. And these are the first boots that have lasted. 8 months and they are still super comfortable and have plenty of tread left and zipper is still as good as new. I am 6'8&#34; and weigh 280lbs! So those boots get a huge workout! Awesome product. i had to buy shoes every 2-3 months. I never reviewed a product twice. But I just had to. Will buy another pair if these ever wear out. Thank you so much for offering such great boot! Worth every penny and then some.	2015-08-05

A very light weight shoe, mid to low arch support and not super cushy inside. However, they formed to my foot very well after a few wears and are very good for exercise. Keeps the foot cool.

My first first Toms, after all the skepticism on if they would be comfortable etc, I just decided to try it. Always liked the style, but wanted something a little different from the plain colours I see all the time. The stripes added a bit more.<br /><br />Pros: First off, I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these were. I am not a shoe expert nor a professional with the biology of the human foot, all I can say is these are one of the most comfortable casual footwear I have had in some time. And this is the case when having to wear them a couple hours well. There was no irritation or uncomfortable feeling after wearing this all day even.<br /><br />Secondly of course is the look or style. I did buy this one for the stripes and the variance to the regular plain colours. I must say I am going to buy them again in the different colours because they are true to the pic, but honestly look better when you actually receive them.<br /><br />Cons: Not so much a con, but the one thing for me that was different from most other shoe brands is they come a little bit bigger. Not as in a shoe size or anything. It is probably why they a comfortable, but they fit great. It is just something to keep in mind for people who may have slim feet like I do, you can probably get away buying a half size smaller with these. That said, this is just a personal preference how I like my footwear snug, so by no means a design flaw or anything, hence I could not take off a star!<br /><br />Great shoes overall, and probably now my favourite casual go to shoes.	2015-08-05

I used the guide comparing the tip of the heel to the size of a dime and it is very misleading. The Large was way too big for the heel I needed to repair. I tried to use the caps on another pair to put them to use but when you put them on, the plastic cap looks cheap and the adhesive strap that secures it looks a lot like electrical tape around the bottom of the heel. These would be fine for a quick fix in a pinch (be careful of sizing) but for me they would not be good enough for long term use. With this product you get what you pay for.	2015-08-05

I loved these shoes at first - they fit so nicely I felt i could wear them forever. Though they were slightly more narrow than expected. I have flat feet though, and the arch support actually gave me a lot of foot pain when walking around without them on. Very infrequently do I find shoes where the arch support actually fits on the arch of my foot - it's always slightly off, too flat or too high and in the wrong places. Similarly, it made the bottom joint of my big toe on my sole pretty achy. Additionally, after a while of wearing them, I noticed both my big toes were going numb. Then, I noticed nerve pain and pinching on the outer side of my toe where the strap crosses over on the inside of the toe loop. It sucked! It was really painful and numb for about ~3 weeks after not wearing them anymore. I tried a couple of times to wear them again after it healed, but the toe strap just keeps getting WAY too tight way too fast and I can feel it constricting - it makes sense that my nerves were pinched. I haven't seen anyone else complain about this though, so I'm wondering if maybe the shoe was too small or something and hitting my foot in the wrong place? The size 7 were WAY too big and the 6 were bordering on too small. Sucks because they were so cute	2015-08-05

I originally ordered the boots in a size 11M with a steel toe.  I have large big toes and after wearing twice, I got a large blister on the right big toe from rubbing against the steel in the toe.  Since I wore them twice and also waterproofed them, I did not expect an exchange.  I contacted the seller hoping for a discount on a new pair.  Instead, I was told that if I returned the boots they would send me a new pair in an 11W without a steel toe at no extra charge.  Within a couple of days of receipt of the return I received my new boots.  They fit great and I couldn't be happier.	2015-08-05

It is a canvas style shoe with a design unlike others that I have seen on the market so it will definitely help yo stand out from the large amount of people purchasing TOMS inspired canvas shoes these days. The material is comfortable on your feet and fits nicely. I certainly do love the pattern on the canvas and it complements the designs near the stitching and sole. The shoes is well made and comfortable and the sole is definitely built to last. The design of the shoes reminds me of a cross between classic vans and Toms if you want a good visual. I recommend it especially if you are into unique patterns.	2015-08-05

Mostly because they are VERY well made with premium materials, last a long time (which may be bad for them), look great with many styles and colors, are the best value in the shoe market, and are COMFORTABLE!  These are wide with a big toe box with plenty of room which makes them very comfortable.  They're easy to put on and take off without untying them.  What can I say, i think they're the best shoes on the market.  This style, the Stag series, however, is not my favorite.  The Pure series seems to use thicker materials and be more substantial (heavier) and I just like them better than the Stag series.  But if you like a lighter shoe you may like these!

Asics sent me these running shoes to replace a pair that fell apart on the inside. This right shoe of pair fell apart on the tread. The rubber tread separated from the foam in numerous places. I contacted Asics and they told me the warranty only covers my original purchase not the pair they sent me to repace defective pair I bought.  I don't even use these shoes to run. I use them to workout at the gym, use the elliptical and run errands. Pretty poor quality.  So I've only ever owned 2 pairs of Asics and both have been defective. And the company DOES NOT stand behind its product. I'll be going back to buying Nike and New Balance shoes.	2015-08-05

Great support and they keep me anchored to the ground through my swing.  Excellent shoes.  Very comfortable right out of the box.  Golf shoes years ago really hurt your feet at first.  There have been many changes in golf shoes and the materials they are using now feel more like running shoes (Addidas).  So much nicer to not have to break them in.  Stylishly I'm glad I bought the silver.  I saw Jason Day wearing them at the British Open.  Did a little bit of looking and saw that Adidas set up four golfers with clothes and shoes for each day.  They looked great and I thought I might too.  I think so.	2015-08-05

I bought them at the beginning of winter and wore them religiously. The most comfortable boots I had ever worn. But then one day I was sitting in the car and realized that my pinky toe was getting a little too cold. The boots had split right down the side, where the rubber sole meets the suede. I was so upset, but figured it might be an isolated incident and was willing to buy another pair; however, a few days later my sisters pair (same style) did the exact same thing. It is a bearpaw thing, not isolated. I will go ahead and find a different brand next year. $70+ is way to much to spend for a pair of boots to last a few months.	2015-08-05

Cute shoes, BUT I noticed yesterday that the ball of my right foot was starting to hurt.

I also received them and the the rubber heel was flappy,  easy fix with glue, but still not worth 4 or 5 stars.  That should have been taken care of with the seller or manufacturer, not the buyer.  SO, with the gel insert around the toe thong, and the glue to fix the heel, they will work.  Like I said, they are cute!	2015-08-05

It has adequate space for coins, cards, and money. Without anything in it it is kind of thick, and putting anything in it makes it definitely thick, but it's a manageable thickness (in the event you aren't wearing tight pants with tight pockets).  I really like that the coin pocket has an expandable side to allow for more change if needed and I really like that there is a snap to keep the wallet closed. As far as other cons, the card slots are pretty tight and hard to get cards in and out. However, since it's leather, I'm expecting it to loosen up over time as the leather gets worked with use, so it's not that bad. I prefer snaps over velcrow or zipper to keep the wallet shut, but it would have been nicer to have perhaps two snaps or a bigger snap with reinforcement to keep it more firmly closed on the sides.  And as a personal preference, I would have liked a grommet or eyelet in order to put a snap or lanyard on the wallet to hook it on my belt (for constant fear a wallet will jump out of my pocket and get lost or stolen). So I'm going to buy an eyelet and install one myself someday. Overall, I really enjoy the design and quality and look forward to using this wallet.	2015-08-05

I was on a golf trip in myrtle beach during July and 95 degree weather with 80% humidity and all of my playing partners had Oakley glasses but could not wear them due to fogging, but these have slots at the top of the lenses and sides that allow air to flow through- no fogging at all. These are worn by Louis Ooshuizen, and you know how Louis has played the last two majors.....just sayin.	2015-08-05

They are incredibly comfortable and gorgeous!<br />I have flat feet. Like no arch at all. My friend read that Asics GT-1000 4 are great for us archless people, so I went straight to Amazon. I wasn't crazy about any of the 4s, but I saw these 3s and fell in love. (Pink is my favorite color)<br />The shoes come with bright pink shoelaces, as well as bright pink ribbon shoelaces.<br />After the shoes arrived, I left town for 10 days and took only these sneakers. Without arch supports, which I have needed in every pair of shoes for as long as I can remember, these were incredibly comfortable. We spent an entire day walking around stores and tourist sites and my feet weren't achy when we got home.<br />I highly recommend these shoes, especially if you have arch problems.	2015-08-05

This pair has a slightly longer, wider left shoe, which is absolutely perfect for me.  I wonder if Amazon sent them to me because of my review when I had to return a different shoe I loved because I couldn't find a same-size pair with both length and width that would work for my two very different feet.

I wear 9 in heels and 9.5 in flats so I ordered 9.5 and it's a perfect fit. There will be a break-in period as the foot area is a bit stiff but I don't foresee a problem. The leather is soft and supple with just the right amount of slouch. I have normal calves and can wear them buckled on the middle notch with skinny jeans. So happy I found these beauties for $165 for the dark brown vintage calf and the next day they were $100 more. They arrived 1 day earlier than expected.	2015-08-05

He likes the wallet but says it's hard to get out of his back pants pocket.  He says part of the problem is the slickness of the wallet, but that was one of the features that I chose it for having, so that it would slide easily out of his pocket.  Go figure....  I like the organization of the card holders, the fact that the bill department is divided, and the see-through ID part.  I would give the wallet a 4 or 5, but since he's the user, I took his comment into consideration as well.	2015-08-05

The fit is perfect and they offer just enough to support that I love wearing them to do anything from running errands to hiking.

Also the toe area is reinforced to protect your toes from rocks ( or in my case any and everything I manage to stub my toes on). Seem to be extremely well made and durable. No break in time necessary, fit and felt great right out of the box. Loved them so much I just bought a second pair!	2015-08-05

It fully separated from the sole within just a few games (in sum total, a matter of just a few hours on the mound). The bottom of the shoe began to separate during an outing resulting in my daughter having to leave the game as the sole was literally flapping and gathering handfuls of dirt. Perhaps the largest disappointment of anything I have purchased on Amazon.<br /><br />I should note that the seller was very helpful and this is in no way their fault. They allowed me to return them without a hassle.	2015-08-05

I was diagnosed recently with plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis and these shoes have helped tremendously.  They are very comfortable - so much so, that I even wear them around the house, even though they are somewhat dressy looking. My feet and Achilles tendon don't hurt at all when I wear these shoes.  I can even stand for a long time and walk in them comfortably.  The height is JUST RIGHT.  In fact, the little bit of heel helps my Achilles tendon from hurting.  I normally wear a 9.5 - 10 in a medium width and the 10 fits me perfectly.<br /><br />The only reason I removed a star was because for the price, I would expect the upper to be made of real leather instead of synthetic material.  But overall, the construction feels solid and of high quality. And they're stylish too!  Nobody would ever guess this is an orthopedic shoe.	2015-08-05

I am 5 foot 7 inches and weigh 155 pounds.  I made a small modification to the location of the velcro and it added about a half an inch to the circumference of the strap.  You really only need about an inch of velco overlap to secure the shoe.  My solution was to shorten the furry part of the velcro down to an inch (actually remove the stitching and detach it from the strap and cut off part of it and sew / reattach it back the strap.  secondly, move the prickly velcro closer to the end of the strap.  that way the length of strap that wraps back on itself is less allowing the strap to be looser around your ankle.  Now (after the mod) these are the perfect sandal and the strap is loose enough I can slide if off over my heel without having to un-do it!  I can also make it a little tighter if I plan on a lot of walking.  I have to have arch support and am always putting arch inserts into all my shoes, however, i find i can wear these all day and have no problems.  The strap makes them much more secure (you may miss the slap, slap sound that regular flip flops make) they feel like flip flops, but are great for all day and walking.  they seem to squish my toes together less than the original kind with the over the toe strap too.  I am really happy with these now and am trying to restrain myself from buying more in different colors!  Hope this helps you all.	2015-08-05

This is my third pair of Doc Martens boots, this is the first of this kind and won't be my last. I was a little worried about the size and wear after reading some of the reviews. But, I stayed with my size men's 11USA, and they fit nicely. I only wear these as a casual boot and when I ride my Harley, I haven't had any problems as of yet! The other boots I owed from Doc Martnen's where abused and never a issue, the only thing that worries me is the thin sole, there isn't very much material there and I can see how the sole would rip off, I hope not. Again, I would buy this boot again, it is very stylish and since owning these boots I can't keep the woman off me!! They look great with jeans!	2015-08-05

They fit true to size and I did not find them to be too narrow or wide. I have a normal width foot. The leather is beautiful; durable but soft. The only thing that I was slightly disappointed about was the interior. From the photo I thought the inside was grey suede but it is actually some sort of faux synthetic material. Not a big deal though as the rest of the boot is gorgeous. These will look so cute in the fall with skinnies or tights and skirt with maybe some boot cuffs on top. My new favorite boot brand is CAT!!	2015-08-05

I ordered the 10 like I normally wear and they were so small I could barely fit my foot in and couldn't buckle the straps at all. However since they felt comfortable otherwise and I lived the look, I exchanged them for the next size up. The 11's looked and felt superb. I wore them to a show and they were very comfortable as elegant. I'm very tall and never wear heels and it is difficult to find shoes that are flat strappy and little black dress appropriate.

I've been a fan of Buxton wallets for years as they're well organized and compartmentalized. But, in learning about preventing identity theft I was advised to get an RFID wallet. I was delighted Buxton had one similar to my pervious Buxton wallets, but it was smaller so I was very skeptical about whether I could fit my things into it, or if I'd even like it. Anyway, I've been using it for over a month now and it's awesome. It holds my currency, coins and dental picks on one side, my license and a little comb fit in the outside insert for easy use and display, and the credit card compartment holds all my cards as well as some important papers I folded to fit. It also takes up less space in my purse. It's great! I feel safe now when I'm on public transit and in other public places where I'm told people steal personal and financial information using radio frequencies. So, I highly recommend this item!	2015-08-05

They fit my feet better than any other shoes that I owned or worn in the past. Doc's are the best shoes I've ever owned. It did not take long to break in these shoes but this varies from person to person. They say they are Women's shoes but these Docs are unisex from experience. They are a little bit tighter than the regular Docs but I prefer the tighter fit myself. You can't beat the price on these shoes and I'd easily recommend these to any friend. In short they are at a great price, fit great, are really comfortable and look great too.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've had them for a few months now and have worn them frequently. These shoes can be scuffed pretty easily near the toes but, it kind of adds character.	2015-08-05

While not perfect for this use, it serves the purpose and makes a stunning impression. (I received comments on its first client visit.) The bag is beautifully made. I love the details, the lining, the handles, and that it sits flat to the floor without tipping. The interior pockets are oddly sized (narrow and deep), and there is not a dedicated business card or pen pocket, which was a disappointment. And although the bag easily accommodates my file folders, the height of the folders does restrict being able to zip the bag closed. I decided I could live with that because the bag is so gorgeous, especially in the chili color that I selected. It's a keeper.	2015-08-05

Unfortunately (at least for me), Saucony changed the slim bottom of the A-series with its signature little rubber triangles into a more generic Saucony EVA and rubber version.<br />The result is a shoe that feels more like a trainer (think light version of Kinvara) and less like that special pair just for racing day.<br />Saucony did manage to make the shoe even lighter, which is pretty impressive, but it has less ground feel and grip (could just be perception because of the thicker sole) than its previous iteration.<br />It is still a fantastic racing flat, just not as good as its predecessor in my opinion.	2015-08-05

Years ago, I got a job that forces me to wear them...after a long search, I determined that Timberland steel/composite toe are the only boots I could adequately break in and wear comfortably. I've worn their Pro-Titans for years without an issue.<br /><br />The ironic thing about these Hyperion boots is the huge ad campaign they had advertising, specifically, their comfort. I regretfully bought in. These are without a doubt the most uncomfortable boots on the planet. The toe box is waaaaaaay too small (size 12W for me)...I can't bear to wear these things for more than a few minutes. I have to wear them untied and loose laced just to make them somewhat bearable. They also weigh a metric ton.<br /><br />I kept them figuring it would take a week or so to break them in. I've been wearing them for over a month now, with zero improvement. Can't return them, so they'll be dropped in a donation bin soon.<br /><br />Haven't had any issues with them falling apart as others have said here, but that's probably because I can't tie them, so they don't flex much. I don't doubt that the mesh on them would come apart if they were worn properly.<br /><br />Unless you like paying $160 + for twin paperweights, I'd avoid these. I notice those &#34;when you're feet hurt....&#34; commercials have finally stopped airing...I guess Timberland figured out how much these boots suck.	2015-08-05

We had to order a size larger than expected because the size I though she would be fit the same as the ones she wore last year. Also, they had a terrible and strong plastic/chemical smell when we first opened them up, and it lasted a long time. We had to let them &#34;air out&#34; for a few weeks before it really went away, so it is good we ordered them well before we needed them. Otherwise, the sandals are very cute, and they look just like the pictures. My kid seems to like them.	2015-08-05

Then, I broke the joint of my bones just beneath my toes on my right foot and it never healed properly, SOooooo finding stylish dress shoes (with heels) has REALLY become a challenge!<br /><br />I tried a number of shoe lines on Amazon and every possible size and width of the Madden pumps (which look really smart and sexy) but could not find a single set that I could wear for more than a few minutes without pain.<br /><br />THEN, I happened upon the Bella Vita Women's shoes and bought a darling pair of blue (faux Alligator pattern) heeled sling back sandals and with a simple gel shoe cushion in sole, found a fun and gorgeous pair of shoes that can be worn for dressy occasions or casual.<br /><br />Next, I decided to try these Platform Pumps to wear with dresses and skirts - again, they can be worn with dressy outfit or fairly casual (slacks or nice casual skirt). I believe the sizes are pretty accurate but I've been buying a half size larger and, the wider &#34;C&#34; width so I can put the gel sole inserts in and not irritate that right toe area - which is very sensitive.<br /><br />These are IMO one level up from the typical 'comfort shoe' lines yet they are truly comfortable and I love that they have a nice heel to add height but, the squared heel and special rubber cushion on bottom of shoes make me feel confident walking in them as they provide extra support and stability - whether walking on marble/tile floors or, on carpet. Also, no worries about an ankle turning due to narrow/slippery pin point heels.<br /><br />I had almost thought I would never be able to wear stylish high-heeled shoes again until I happily came across the Women's Bella Vita line!	2015-08-05

Not only do we not love these, we hate them. My husband took my son to get another pair of shoes for school when I was working. They came home with these. I had my doubts based on the back strap width. The words are wide enough that when the foot is flexed, the strap is going to push into the back of the ankle. He wanted to wear them anyway, so I let him against my better judgement. He is 4, so he would wear shoes that are 3 sizes too small if they have the right character on them.<br /><br />He wore these for the first time today for preschool. They came home wrecked, and he limped the whole way home from preschool. He has a large blister on the top of his foot where the shoes rubbed, and the design on the shoes is scraped. They look like shoes we have had for months, not one day. Very disappointed. I don't feel right returning worn shoes, so I suppose we will just throw them out.	2015-08-05

I originally purchased a size 9 and felt these were a bit loose, so I exchanged them for an 8.5, but these were too tight. Ugh, the struggle! In any case, I re-purchased the size 9 pair and feel like they fit fine (with some room to wiggle my toes). I didn't have any pain or discomfort with these shoes, which is a plus considering the heels are quite high and the ankle strap is thin. They are stylish and great for any summer outfit.	2015-08-05

US	30899355	RXNU821VITIHN	B005708LW2	161413254	White Mountain Women's Icon	Shoes	4	2	2	N	Y	Comfortable and Versatile	I like the shoes enough that they end up being my workhorse for most outfits.  They go with everything, and the heel height is completely manageable; plus, the wedge is very stable, and even mildly springy, so they're easy to walk in.  The shoe laces aren't waxed, so they stay knotted, which is a plus.  The only downside is that they are a little narrow and a little small overall.  I generally wear between 8.5 and 9 women's, and my feet are consistently average/medium width in pretty much every manufacturer's shoe.  Although you can adjust the laces, it's obvious that the shoe runs narrow.  Note: the problem is not the suede material that goes around and over the widest part of your foot----the problem is really that the footbed is too narrow.  The suede stretches out a little, so it ends up not being much of an issue, but it's worth mentioning.<br />----------------------<br />Update May 2016:  Downgraded to 3 stars.<br /><br />Just wanted to come back with a few comments after 8 months of use----<br />---The suede stretches out a LOT.  When I first got these shoes, they felt very narrow, and now, they are extremely loose.<br />---Because of the stretch factor, the toe box becomes easily deformed.  So instead of a rounded toebox, you end up seeing some of the lumps and outlines of your foot.<br />---At the base of the tongue, where it meets the rest of the shoe, the seams have started to rip.  There's some white stitching under there, so its kind of noticeable.<br />---Surprisingly, the heel has held up perfectly well.  There's almost no wear and tear, and that's usually the first thing to go on my shoes.<br /><br />Overall, I think this was an okay shoe that I enjoyed wearing for a few months.  But 8 months later, they are almost unwearable.  Seems like a short lifespan, which is why I'm downgrading my initial 4 star review to 3 stars.	2015-08-05

I can honestly say that I've never lost a pair in my life. He's guaranteed to lose at least 2-3 pairs per year.<br />The rubber nose pieces and the rubber on the ear pieces are extremely comfortable and make it so he can wear these sunglasses all day long if need be. The polarized lenses are the perfect shade of darkness, they keep the sun out, but they don't hinder your eyesight at all.<br />The black plastic rims give a sporty look that any man looks to achieve with their sunglasses!<br />The carrying pouch is great because it helps keep the lenses scratch free and I'm hopeful these will help him keep them around longer than other pairs. He can never own too many so I'm extremely glad I ordered these for him!<br />Disclosure: I purchased this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.	2015-08-05

They're really adorable and they fit very well, but I did order a 1/2 size down from what I usually wear (I'm an 8 in shoes like sneakers and boots, a 7.5 in most flats and heels, and a 7 in these shoes). They're also the perfect height, remaining walkable and comfortable while still looking like an actual heel and not 50 year old lady kitten heels. The toebox, as mentioned in other reviews, is very tight but I expect it will loosen with some wear and at the very least is tolerable for short durations. I did order a second pair from a different retailer in a wide and didn't see much of a difference in fit.	2015-08-05

I am less tired after a day wearing them, whether for hiking or just living. I have very flat feet and the support from these is just right. Having read all the reviews, I bought a half size larger.  The toe box is lovely and when I walk down hill they are perfect. I will look for an insert to cushion behind my heel and that should take care of the slightly too long feeling. I did later try on a pair of 8.5s, my normal size, and they were a little tight, so my decision to go up a half size was correct. I do recommend these shoes and will probably buy another pair.	2015-08-05

The shoe true to size and are very comfortable. One thing I noticed about this bootie that is different from others is that the top where the strap is has an indent(the bootie isn't cut straight across) This doesn't cause an uncomfortable rubbing feeling which has happened to me with other booties which are cut straight across. I hope this post helps. Can't wait to wear them this fall. I ordered them in all colors.	2015-08-05

These fit great and even have a little room to grow.  The shoes themselves are adorable.

You can't even really tell you have shoes on aside from the comfort.  Super light weight.  Update: Although these shoes were very comfortable I had to come back because several of those pink dots under the shoe fell off on my right shoe and 1 on the left shoe.  I couldn't find any product to glue them back on and I've lost some anyway.  Comfy, but they fell apart about 7 months after wearing them.	2015-08-05

I intend to use casually for the short term, and then into more rugged stuff as my present active shoes wear out, so not trail-tested at this point.<br /><br />Fit/size: Adequate length for what I am used to in a 10.5 D, though on the narrow side. In terms of reference points, I'd say it's similar in width to a Puma 10.5, but longer -- close to the Nike running shoes that I've owned. Nothing uncomfortable with arch support on a mildly flat foot.<br /><br />Durability TBD.<br /><br />For the time being, I am very satisfied for the sub-$30 price point.	2015-08-05

I can't make it through an eight hour shift wearing them yet. I will continue to try an break them in. There isn't as much cushion or support as my other steeled toed shoes, but they are half the price.

(I have Amazon Prime so it was only around $56) Its a decent size and has a really cute design on the inside. Theres also a little pocket on the inside of the bag. It's big enough to hold small items like a lip balm or my iPod nano, but not big enough to hold my iPhone 6. Also the flap in the front opens to another small pocket. Since its so tiny it is a little difficult to open and there isn't much room in it to put anything so I don't use it. But overall I'm happy with my purchase. If you're the type of person who needs to pack in a lot in your purse then I wouldn't recommended this bag for you. This seems perfect for those who just need to carry the basics, like your phone and wallet.	2015-08-05

She needed slip resistant shoes and black, but wanted something a little cuter than the typical waitress shoe. Plus, we wanted something that would support her feet properly - call it an investment. These were the right investment. She sometimes was on her feet for 10 hours with no breaks, and these shoes saw her through that. These are lighter weight than the typical Dansko shoes many expect. A nice small heel height, nice leather, but did run slightly large so we went down the 1/2 size. And they are attractive! She has nothing but positive to say about these shoes. As her mom, I'm glad we bought them - meant a lot less whining when she got home! I knew when we went to look around that Dansko was a brand to look at and they did not fail us.	2015-08-05

I have mixed feelings about them.<br /><br />What I like:  the contour of the foot bed and arch support are great.  The furry material is nice and soft against the skin and the slippers feel well-constructed.<br /><br />What I don't like:  I wish the heel was just a little higher.  I feel like my heel sits really low and my Achilles tendon feels stretched out when wearing them (i.e. hurts).  The style is also very old lady looking and I don't like the Velcro closure.  There's something funky about it and sometimes I feel the Velcro touching my skin and have to undo and redo the closure.<br /><br />I normally wear a 9.5 - 10 women's shoe and I ordered the 9, which fits just right, so these run a little large.	2015-08-05

A size 7 is more like an 8 1/5  or a 9 and it says MED and it's more like a double &#34;E&#34; width. Made in China. Too bad. Being soft..this is true but I have an American foot. And I do wear an American Medium width. There is also too much space between the top of my foot and the top of the shoe arch...the only way to keep it on is with the strap...but it's like wearing the box  shoes come in...  It says women's...this is more like a man's shoe.<br />The smallest size they offer is a 6 MEDIUM....which means it's more like a size 8 double &#34;E&#34; width.  Should have had a market study in America and learned something about OUR shoe sizes that are most popular.

I was nervous about getting white for an active toddler, but white goes with everything in the summer. I'm glad I took the chance on the white because they don't look dirty and I can easily wipe off when she scuffs them up. My favorite part is that they are waterproof - so she can wear them at the splash pad, beach, etc and we don't have to change her shoes. We'll definitely be buying more as her feet grow.	2015-08-05

I have used it with the chain (to keep my hands free) and without, and the gold is not too shiny, almost silvery.

[[ASIN:B00G6Y9YCY Orlimar Athena Ladies Golf Sandal Taupe/Black]]  Normally, I would choose a size 8.5 US golf sandal, but after reading some reviews I went with the size 9 and I am glad I did.  They fit snugly.  They are extremely lightweight.  The foot surface is so easy to clean. Occasionally I pick up a stone which forces me to slip the sandal off to remove it, but with the velcro  straps this is not a chore.I would buy these again.	2015-08-05

I would not recommend wearing them in warm weather because the fleece inside is very thick. Since it is man made fleece it really makes your feet sweat. The outside is man made suede like material.

I would not wash these as they will likely fall apart.	2015-08-05

If those shoes were really like these &#34;originals,&#34; then it's no wonder I was constantly plagued with shinsplints. I didn't buy this particular pair for running--I thought they'd be good for casual walking or trips to the gym, since they looked light and I liked the basic black/white design. Meanwhile, the price was right. However, they have so little support that I found walking in them rather uncomfortable, even with Superfeet insoles. I'd therefore caution anyone whose feet need a minimal amount of support and protection to think twice about buying these.	2015-08-05

I'm a woman and I usually wear size 11 women's boots. I'm required to wear steel toe for work. Its been difficult (near impossible in fact) to find a woman's boot in my size. These are lighter weight than other steel toe boots I've worn which makes them much easier to wear all day. I like the cowboy style because I've been very uncomfortable in other boots because a boot shaped for a man's ankle just doesn't work for a woman. Besides, cowboy boots are at least sort of unisex, I don't feel like I'm wearing clunky men's boots anymore. The thick rubber sole seems to provide enough cushion. The floors at my work are all concrete and I'm here 9 hours a day 5 days a week. I spend a lot of my day at a desk but the floors are still concrete. I've only been wearing these for a week but they are already better than my last pair of CAT steel toe boots that I paid the same amount of money for. My next pair of boots I will look for a shorter shaft, this one is fine, it hits right below the fullest part of my calf, any higher and they wouldn't fit and I would have had to return them. They are a good value for what you get, in my opinion. I wish the shaft on these was leather too because the synthetic gets a lot hotter in the summer but so far its been okay (think July). The main part over my foot is leather and they have a nice insole that helps wick moisture away from the foot. The stitching pattern is nice even though mostly its covered by my jeans. I'm hopeful that they will hold up over time. They are a little tight across the top of the arch, I have quite high arches but I think as they break in that will get better.	2015-08-05

These Are Much Lower Quality Than The Originals.	Soles started falling apart after FIRST ride.  One boot felt like it was an entire size larger.<br /><br />Rider Type: Primarily long distance endurance and adventure riding.<br />Bike: BMW R1200GS Adventure<br />Age:  54<br />Years Riding: 30+<br />Size Boot: U.S. Men 9<br /><br />I have a pair of Tourmaster Solution 1.0 boots that have traveled the world with me without a problem. After many tens of thousands of miles, it was time to retire them.  I replaced them with Tourmaster Solution 2.0 boots and boy, what a mistake.<br /><br />First the boots arrived and looked to be okay but made of much cheaper materials and with much less support than the originals. They are just not the as well made as the originals in materials or in quality. After trying them on, the left boot felt fine but the right boot felt an entire size too large.  I bought some aftermarket foot beds and heel support and they then felt minimally okay but still not what they should.  The heel cup is not formed well, the foot form is wide and they are just flimsy in terms of construction. Overall, they are just not made of quality materials and so the more they're worn the looser and less supportive they become.<br /><br />I wore them around my office and my home for  bit to break them in and last week finally had a chance to use them on some longer 500 mile rides.  After the first ride, I looked at the soles and the rubber had actually torn in the middle of the boot.  Incredibly, the rubber on the sole seems to be just a covering of some type and the foot pegs actually tore through the rubber making holes in the center of the sole after just the FIRST ride of about 500 miles.  The sole also began losing chunks of rubber on the ball of the foot.<br /><br />I have posted pictures below.  One picture is of the sole of the left boot of the original Tourmaster Solution 1.0 after about 100,000 miles and 5 years of wear on several different bikes but with at least 30,000 miles on my BMW R1200GS Adventure.The second is the Tourmaster Solution 2.0 after one 500 mile ride on my BMW R1200GS Adventure.<br /><br />These boots are not like the originals and should be considered to be even minimally adequate for any type of serious motorcycling.	2015-08-05

They are extremely comfortable.<br />I usually wear a size 10 Australian shoe (42) which is the same as a US 10. These are true to size. I also wear a 10 in Born shoes (which I love) to give you an idea of the fit. These are just as comfortable though the leather is not as soft. It does, however, look as though it will not stretch as quickly (which is a good thing). They are fully lined in leather and are worth the price.<br />They are quite elegant and look great with a dress or pants.They don't have a clunky wide look at the toes like a lot of my shoes, but they still fit my wide foot and long toes.<br />I was surprised yesterday to realise that I was looking my several-inches-taller-than-me friend right in the eyes as, they are so comfortable, I forget I am wearing heels. The 'wooden' pattern on the heel looks great and the diagonal strap is very attractive, giving the Mary Jane a less childish look.<br />I thoroughly recommend these shoes- beautiful and comfortable.	2015-08-05

I love the looks of these sandals.  I did, however, have to add another notch, to make the shoes a little tighter on my feet.  I chose the tan and I love the look of the small studs on the shoe.  They are comfortable and love that I can wear these with anything, especially since I chose a neutral color.  The toe thong did not bother me at all, as I was afraid being a wedge sandal and having a toe thong, this would bother me, but it didn't.  Shoe fits perfectly, other than adding an additional notch.  Very cute shoe!<br /><br />***I received a complimentary product, in exchange, for my honest opinion.	2015-08-05

I tried these on in a Fluevog store but the 10.5 was a little short. They didn't have an 11 and I was slightly heartbroken. But then Amazon has everything and they had this lovely shoe in an 11!!! I ordered immediately. Most expensive shoes I've ever owned. Ever. And so cute and comfortable and worth it. A worthwhile splurge. The guy at the store did mention that this shoe runs a little short and it was definitely the only shoe I tried on that I would have needed a size 11 in, rather than a 10 or 10.5. You might want to consider sizing up.	2015-08-05

So I'm happy I found these instead.  They were much less expensive and seem to have some arch support that the crocs I have had do not.  My real size is 11 1/2 N but that is impossible to find so I was happy to find 11M.  They are just a tad too short but are fine,  There's a little lip in the back that was hitting me in the heel but of course it's soft and I think I'm settling into them already.  It has rained a lot here this year so I thought that it would be good to have a pair of plastic sandals to wear on a warm rainy summer days.  They seem like they should be comfortable enough to wear all day but time will tell.  One thing I like about Crocs, and these, too I'm sure, is that they don't need polishing, just scrubbing with soap and water!	2015-08-05

I haven't worn them for long periods of time yet but because they can be tied, a person will be able to adjust them to most widths and, I think, even be able to pop any orthotic into the shoe.  They run true to size, leaving room for a small sock.  I love that the sides have open areas so I can wear different colored socks to change the color look.  Run to purchase these shoes.

How adorable are these toddler rain boots?!  I love the color and the pattern and your little girl will too.  A lot of times you can have trouble getting kids to dress for the weather because the clothes are boring.  Your girl will be begging you to let her wear these rain boots!  Even though they don't have zippers, they are still fairly easy to get off and on.  Your girl may even be able to do it herself since they just slip on.  They provide great protection from the rain and puddles. My niece put them on just so she could jump around in the rain.  She jumped around in comfort and style for quite a while and her feet stayed dry.  And once they are worn, if they happen to get muddy or dirty, they are extremely easy to wipe clean.  The material of the boots is durable and strong.  They will really last and will probably outlast your girl's wear of them.  I really love these boots and highly recommend them.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.	2015-08-05

I must preface this by saying that I have NEVER written a review on shoes, but THESE shoes are so amazing that I had to!  I NEVER wear heels, partially because I am 5'9&#34;, but moreso because I am all about comfort, and i've had very painful experiences trying to wear most heels.  Seriously, comfort is of paramount importance to me, and I refuse to wear things just because it's cute.<br /><br />I am happy to say that I didn't have to sacrifice comfort for a cute pair of heels, I finally found a pair that has both qualities.  I honestly never though i'd find a pair of heels, wedge or not, that would be comfortable enough to wear all day.  I was able to wear these shoes for a full day of walking around at work, and into the night without ever once being uncomfortable.  I highly recommend these, especially for women who prefer comfort over cuteness...now you don't have to choose!	2015-08-05

He was so happy with his first pair, he decided to purchase a second when the first pair finally wore out. He has told me that they are one of the most comfortable sneakers he's ever worn. He wore his old pair on average about 4 hrs a day during week days and 8 hr+ on weekends. He never experienced issues with foot pain. After over a year of continuous use (and playing soccer in them), the leather trim on the front outside of the shoe developed a hole, hence why it was time to purchase a second pair. The simple Adidas style and quality are enough to keep him buying this same shoe over and over again.	2015-08-05

The upper is a thin, flimsy material like the thin craft foam you'd buy at Michael's or Joann's, and both shoes were bent/creased around the foot opening from either poor storage or rough shipping (they were sent in a baggie-type envelope rather than box); this made them completely unsightly. I'm a size 7 1/2 but typically need to order up with nice leather clogs - so I made the mistake of ordering an 8; these, however, were HUGE, overly wide, and floppy...I probably could have fit in a 6 easily. Perhaps these are men's shoes and I should have ordered two sizes down? Who knows. To top it all off, they're very &#34;squishy&#34; when you walk. I'm sure someone thought it'd be a good idea to make them like this for &#34;comfort&#34; or something, but what it does instead is a) not give any arch support, and b) make it completely unstable as you walk. If you're a nurse who needs to be zipping around all the time, these are NOT the shoes for you.	2015-08-05

After a Google search, I learned that this has happened to a lot of people. I tried re - heating and stretching them out, but they're still too tight. It sucks that I have to replace them after having them less than 4 months. It would be nice if they came with a warning.	2015-08-05

I really like the design of these glasses.  The hardware at the joints is good.  They are comfortable for me.  I am a large man (6'4&#34; - 240).  The solid nose bridge is also nice.  I bought the red glasses.  that was maybe the one downside.  On the picture they looked darkish red/burgundy where in fact they are a solid red, almost bright.  My wife likes the color though so I guess its not that bad.  Overall, I love these glasses.  I am thinking of buying another pair (black this time).	2015-08-05

Honestly, I was really excited for these boots and am somewhat disappointed. I ordered the leather ones and they are rather poor quality leather that is not tanned or dyed but painted!  What's more, the left boot came with a crease in the front bell where the paint stuck together. Pulling it apart left a blemish on the paint and removing the crease has proved difficult.

I'm a huge fan of the comfort and durability of these sandals.  I was surprised after receiving these that Adidas has changed a classic sandal.  The strap no longer has the soft, cloth-like feel under the strap.  It is more rubbery, and not as comfortable.  The footbed still feels great, but I'm disappointed they've made this change.  It may help when the sandals are wet, but it's at the expense of the classic comfort of the sandals.	2015-08-05

I needed shoes for work that would work with capris, dress pants, and skirts. These look great, and more importantly to me, are extremely comfortable. I am on my feet a good part of the day, and these have excellent support and fit like a glove. No sore spots anywhere from the very first day, and with bare feet. The wide width fit my wide feet, and do not slip off my narrow heel. I would buy these in as many colors as they came in. Unfortunately, I could only find them in 2 colors in my size.	2015-08-05

US	24788874	R1SIORLHSBQBGM	B00NBWG0N0	853971754	Dr. Scholl's Women's Paige Dress Sandal	Shoes	5	9	9	N	Y	Superior comfort in a trendy heel	First of all, something not mentioned in the description of the product: the heel is 3&#34;.<br /><br />I had my doubts when I was deciding whether or not to buy these. Typically, I've found mule-style heels to be rather narrow, and for my toes to end up crammed in the smaller hole. However, I was in the market for some nice summer sandals that could be dressed up or down, and I figured $40 and free returns would make them worthwhile to at least try out. Although normally I am a size 8, since I have never tried on Dr. Scholl's shoes and a size indication for a pair of Dr. Scholl's flats on Anthropologie's website showed that a 39 would start at an 8 1/2 for this company, I decided to go for the 8 1/2.<br /><br />The fit is very comfortable from the first wear. I tried them on for an 8 hour shift where I would be constantly getting up and down, plus a movie date afterwards, and I found that my toes were only uncomfortable at around the 10 hour mark--way more impressive than I had expected, especially since I don't handle heels above 2 1/2 inches very well. The memory foam really does its job in cushioning your feet, and the heel is thick enough to allow for superior balance throughout the day, even when you're flagging at the end. :) I'm wearing them right now and I've found that the fabric has stretched to better fit my feet, and even though I've been doing some physical labor this morning in these heels my feet are still going strong without a twinge.<br /><br />I bought the taupe version of this sandal, and I have to say that it really fits the summer season and dresses up my casual summer outfits without my putting any extra effort beyond a simple necklace. My one problem is that it does show dirt on the fabric, but that's to be expect for such a light color. All in all, this is a great purchase for the value and I may go for the black version soon!	2015-08-05

I am extremely picky about the type of tennis shoes/sneakers I wear. Every year I would buy the same style of white slide on Skechers for nearly 10 years before I decide to try a new style. I like a basic simple white shoe without laces and these were perfect!  It's been three years, I am on my third pair, and I still adore them! They are comfortable to wear all day! The shoe has no laces to come undone, which is nice when I am hiking, biking, or at the gym.<br /><br />There is always that fear about getting white shoes and how fast they dirty up, when these would get that way, I would throw them in the washer with some bleach and let them air dry. They lasted through several washings and lots of everyday wear and tear. The older pairs I have I retired to lawn shoes and they are still going!<br /><br />I wore these with everything and liked the simple look that they provided. Most of all they didn't hurt my feet to wear all day, they have a nice tight fit, but not to tight, can be worn with or without socks. I liked these shoes so much I got a pair for my best friend last Christmas. These shoes are hard to go wrong with.	2015-08-05

They have a smooth leather sole and are built very narrowly.<br /><br />Many people size up with Fluevogs, but I stick to my size 7 (I have one size 7 foot and one 6.5 foot) in most cases. My width is average. This pair, however, fit about one-half to a full size small, due to the pitch of the heel and the narrow toe box. In 7.5s my smaller right foot is happiest. I had a blister on my toe on the left side after the first wear. I regretted the purchase after trying to wear them a couple times at work. But I have to say after a few weeks, they are breaking in. I don't think they'll ever be for long walks, but they may just get comfortable yet. I'd give three and a half stars at this point.<br /><br />If you go for them,  I recommend a ball-of-foot pad to keep the toes from scrunching at the front. I also recommend sizing up. You may find the heel a little roomy, but the tie will keep your foot in them. I also replaced the ribbon with a silk shoelace, as it should have been in the first place at this price point.	2015-08-05

Confession: this is my own first pair of cowboy boots... and I think I'm in love! I put them on to let the dog out. I put them on to run to the store. I put them on at home... &#34;because my feet are cold!&#34;.<br /><br />I've wanted a sort of all-purpose cowboy boot for ages, but I have wide feet! Not only are &#34;C&#34; width shoes rare, but many of cowboy boots have toe boxes which are purposefully pointy. Even if they were wide cut they would likely still painfully pinch my toes. When I saw this boot with it's cute, snubby little rounded-square (squoval?) toe box and then saw it came in a wide width I pitched it right in my shopping cart!<br /><br />Fit:<br />Width:  Depending on the cut I wear a &#34;C&#34; width shoe most of the time, though I can sometimes get away with a wide cut &#34;B&#34;. These boots fit great in the toe box. I am so pleased! There is enough wiggle room that I can wear thick socks, too! :-)<br /><br />Support: I have wide feet-- and high arches! It's kind of unfair. Anyway, these boots have a decent arch support in the shoe bed. You can reach in the boot and feel the arch support bump with your finger. Also, the boot is slightly snug at the instep. This provides additional support. Depending on where your feet are wide this might be uncomfortable for you, but keep in mind that this is leather and will stretch with time and wear.<br /><br />Heel: My heels are not wide. This boot slips at the heel for me. Though I have read that this is normal in a cowboy boot, it feels like I wish I could get JUST the heel in a smaller size, since the toe-box and instep fit perfectly, but the heel feels big. I may get an insert for this. But as it stands this is fine with socks, as the construction of the heel on this boot is engineered to be a smooth bump inward that doesn't rub. I've worn the boots with shorty athletic socks and thick boot socks - though there is a bit of slip to the heel when walking, there is no painful rubbing for me whatsoever!<br /><br />Boot Shaft: I've worn a friend's Fat Baby's out to help feed the horses before. They had a wider and shorter shaft than these Pro Baby boots do. That said, I have thin ankles and medium thick calves. These boots look better on my legs when I wear them with some boot socks. This also prevents the shaft from rubbing at the curve at the bottom of my calves when wearing them out for long periods.<br /><br />Personal reference for fit: As a person with a normally 7.5 wide foot with high arches, thin ankles and medium-ish calves - I am quite comfortable in the 7.5 C boot. Though I would consider trying 1/2 size smaller if I could have tried this on in the store, the tiny bit of extra room lets me wear a thick pair of socks which is a good thing for boots!<br /><br />Quality:<br />-The boots are well packaged- carefully filled with paper and a boot shaft form. They are carefully wrapped in a pretty tissue-like paper, too. (This means nothing without a good product, but it is a nice appointment which I could appreciate.)<br />-The leather is quite nice. It has a slightly oiled finish to it. Others mentioned that &#34;Driftwood Brown&#34; was distressed leather, but I see no distressing marks on my boots save where they now have walking-stretching marks from normal use. So far, the leather seems of good quality. With care (I am a regular saddle-soaper kind of girl!) they should really last.<br />-All of the stitching, from the piecing, to the shoe bed, to the decorative, down to what I can see inside the boot screams quality. This boot was well put together.<br />-The interior footbed liner and the sole seem thoughtfully engineered for comfort - both touches nodding towards form and function are present here.<br />-The styling is cute and thoughtful (stars - adorable stars! - and pretty lavender lining on a smooth brown boot), but functional (with wearable heel, sole and comfortable toe-box!).<br /><br />Bottom line: I am really impressed with Ariat! I am gratefulto them for making not only a quality shoe, but for offering wide sizes. If you have wide feet you know how rare this is with many shoe companies. If Ariat continues providing quality wide boots like these I will buy again in a heartbeat! :-)<br /><br />Side Note: I added some pictures of my boots (taken after a couple wearings) for your reference as to how they look on a person! You may notice my cat decided to check them out and say &#34;Hi!&#34;, too. She is such a ham! :-)to them for making not only a quality shoe, but for offering wide sizes.

The purse I used prior to needing a cane was a Coach with an adjustable shoulder strap that could have been used cross body, but was so heavy by itself (quality leather) that I now felt weighed down.  I love the Relic Erica Flap cross body for the weight and the well thought out compartments that allow useful separation of items so I am not constantly searching for something.  I also like the simplicity of the outer design that is not loaded down with tassels like the temporary purse I purchased because of its weight. The design is perfect, I simply wish it came in a soft (light) leather.  I have used the purse daily for several months with no visible surface wear.  It was well priced so if/when it does wear out I will probably seek it for a replacement.	2015-08-05

I have super narrow skinny feet and it's hard finding sandals that fit. I have these in 3 colors and I love them! They're all I wear to work in the summer months. I had to punch 1 or 2 extra holes in each buckle, but that's to be expected with my narrow feet. The quality isn't perfect, some straps only had room for 1 more hole while others had room for 2, but it's manageable. I can wear them to work and be fairly comfortable. They look good with skirts, dresses, capri's/cropped pants, and more casual outfits like jean or khaki shorts.	2015-08-05

I already have a purse that is similar to it except it has silver and black zebra strips and no side pockets. It doesn't have the rhinestone belt either, its a circle that you put a chain through. It was good until it ripped in the inside out of nowhere and like 3 weeks after I got it, and just keeps ripping. So I decided to get a new one but different and different vendor. This one is similar on the outside but the material inside seems a lot more durable and put together better. I love this purse and love it's style. It also came so quickly. It said August 6-11 and I got it Wednesday the 5th, and I ordered it on Friday, and I bet if I ordered it at the beginning of the week instead I would have got it within 2 days. I definitely recommend this purse, and it's vendor is very good at responding to questions, and great service.	2015-08-05

Could not resist the price at $29 per pair, but I am not giving them a 4 star because of the price.  The shoes are amazingly light and are awesome for trail hikes.  I wore them to Istanbul 2 weeks ago and they are comfortable all day.  I had bought these for trail hikes since the Nike's I was wearing were not offering me enough traction on dirt trails.  I was concerned about falls.<br /><br />They only challenge I would issue the designers is the amount of cushion at the sole of the shoe which is rather thin (non-existent by most hiking shoe standards) and provide NO arch support.  For that reason alone, I would not recommend running in these shoes because your knee and joints will be taking the pounding not this shoe.  I have tried it and have come away with with shin and foot pain.<br /><br />I am giving them a 3 star since they meet my original need to have very light weight shoes for hiking.  And I like their style.	2015-08-05

I bought these boots at the Rei store because I've always had issue with shoe sizes.  I wear a 10.5-12 depending on the shoe. My feet are weird I guess. So I wanted to make sure the boot fit. I went with the 11.5 and the two sock method. Which ended up a little tighter in the toe than I would have liked. I'll be switching to the sock and liner method.<br /><br />About the boot. I was struggling between this and the Vasque breeze, which is a much lighter and less rigid boot.  But I ended on this one for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />1. I had hurt my instep just prior to buying the boots and I felt much more support and less irritation in this boot.<br /><br />2. It is an all leather boot which should last longer and prove more durable in the end.<br /><br />Ultimately both felt great, I just preferred this one.<br /><br />This boot is extremely rigid. Talking with the sales clerk, he said it takes time to break in this boot. However, after wearing the boot on a day hiking trip the next day the boot felt the way a new boot should and I had no issues with my injury.<br /><br />I was a little scared about the breathability since it's a leather boot and I have eczema on my feet. But after the day, I found that my feet felt great and not irritated.<br /><br />Like I said this is only my initial review. I will update this as time goes on.	2015-08-05

The ankle strap is way too tight.  I have what I would consider regular-sized ankles and normal width feet, definitely not cankles or wide feet, but the strap was so tight it caused the skin on my ankle to form a muffin top over the strap.  So unattractive.  Also, because the ankle strap was so tight, it cause my foot to not slide down into the toe part all the way.  I really wish these could have worked.	2015-08-05

I wear them biking, to the beach, hiking, camping, and they make their way with me into the office every day.

The metal on glass has resulted in a small scraped/rubbed area on each lense. :/	2015-08-05

One is a lot wide and longer than the other.  The Aztec one is smaller than the Biker Chic but the straps are loser.  I still like them, but I wish they could be consistent.  I also had a hard time finding them----no stores---just on line.  So I am not ever sure of the fit.  That is my only gripe!  Got anything for winter?  Love them.  marci	2015-08-05

They seem well made to protect against any rain (hence the lack of oxygen/breathing feel.) It also has cushioning inside the shoe so that you won't feel every step you take as well as top cushioning which would help in colder weather. The elastic piece makes the shoe a little bit tighter than expected but this is a rain boot. It is also on the heavier side but that doesn't bother me for weather boots but good to know for travel.<br />The biggest flaw with this design is that the back of the ankle was design with ridges which I am uncertain as to why and he's not question well enough so that you feel every step take pushing against the back of your ankle which will likely cause blisters when wearing for long periods at a time. Unfortunately, these will most likely feel uncomfortable anytime you wear it and I will probably have to return these for the lower ankle cut.	2015-08-05

They are very true to size, so if you want any wiggle room, then you might want to get a half size bigger.  I enjoy having them fit snug for doing the Zumba classes, as they are flat and do a good job without weighing down my feet.	2015-08-05

This product from Skechers, the Melvin, is one of their relaxed-fit and memory foam combinations--the are incredibly comfortable, especially so with my plantar fascitis (which causes my heel to hurt like crazy!!).  I now own three of them and am now only looking for shoes from Skechers which are both memory foam and relaxed fit.  The shoe also has a very solid quality feel and look good, especially as I have size 12 feet and want to avoid the gun-boat look.	2015-08-05

The lens case IS a bit of a tight fit, but has a firm closure on top, so the glasses will NEVER slip out. I love the zany colors, too! VERY HAPPY with this brand.	2015-08-05

Fit feels a little shorter in the toe box than my other skechers, but still acceptable.  The memory foam takes up more space on the interior of the shoe, so if you're in doubt, go up a half size.  These shoes will be fine for walking on the beach, they're a little more rigid than my pairs that have deeper grooves in the sole.  For workouts in the gym, I prefer a more flexible sole. I purchased these shoes specifically for walking on the beach and for walking, the extra rigidity is fine, it prevents pronation and the memory foam provides a bit more cushioning for the soles of your feet..	2015-08-05

I think it's because they're popular in movies and TV shows. Everyone always looks so cool and suave wearing them, I just wanted to look famous! I chose to purchase them in the smoke color, because I was unsure of the green. I kind of wish I had ordered the green because the smoke is darker than what I'm used to. I wear contacts though so this might have something to do with it.<br />I would like to think I have an average sized head and these glasses fit me perfectly. The nose pieces make them really comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the lenses themselves aren't so big that they take over my entire face.<br />The quality is good, they're metal, not plastic so they can take a little more abuse such as being in my purse or console. They also come in an awesome carrying bag which I love because it helps keep the lenses clear and not scratched.<br />Disclosure: I purchased this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.	2015-08-05

I've always worn men's boots (5.11, bates, etc), but they always slipped A LOT in the heel, were super uncomfortable after a few hours, and really hot (Texas). These boots are awesome! I can wear them all day and forget all about them! These are like wearing tennis shoes all day. And best of all, my heels don't slip anymore!<br /><br />My only complaint is that they don't have a zipper on them (a very necessary item for my work). However, I found a solution for that! Get a pair of [[ASIN:B007DLVLDY LOCK LACES (Black)]] (See picture). I can easily take these boots on and off almost faster than I ever could with zippers. (Also note, in the picture I have them laced a bit different and not as high up for comfort.)<br /><br />I normally wear a women's 10 or a men's 8 and have a somewhat wide foot, so I ordered a 10 in these and they're a smidge on the big side. With my next pair of boots, I will probably order a 9.5. It's been several months and I'm still very thrilled with my purchase!	2015-08-05

You will not regret purchasing these.	I purchased the Catania Occhiali® Sunglasses because I really liked the style and design.  I especially liked how the earpiece was designed I thought it gave the sunglasses a look of class.  I was really delighted when I received them so quickly on the 07/31/15, just two days after I ordered them.  I was very happy with the sturdy construction of the frames.  They are made out of a heavy material, not some flimsy stuff, but they feel light and comfortable on your face.  The hinges are stiff, so they stay form fitted to your head, but not so tightly that they are uncomfortable.  I was able to play a game of Badminton with them on and never had they fallen off once; and we played a hard game and won.  I took several hits to the face with the ball and the sunglasses never scuffed nor scratched.  I went 4-wheeling in them and they stayed on, no problem, even when we got off course and ended up going under low hanging brush, the sunglasses still hung on my face in the same place.  I might add I was not driving.  I chose to review this product for the UberZon Club, and let me tell you this is a great pair of sunglasses at a bargain price. The Catania Occhiali® Sunglasses are made to last.  They are comfortable, fashionable, and they provide 100% UVA and UVB Ray protection.  Now I call that a great pair of sunglasses! If you care about your eyes you’ll get a pair of these sunglasses for yourself and your love ones.  They work great!	2015-08-05

Being an insulin dependant diabetic with peripheral neuropathy(nerve disease) I have to have strong and comfortable shoes.This is probably my 4th or 5th pair of these and they've all worn well and lasted a long time.I haven't had any blister's etc while using Dr. Comfort's.They offer many styles in men and woman's and my podiatrist as well as a Nurses uniform store in town are retailers for Dr. Comfort.I would recommend them to any diabetic patient (as long as their Doctor approved).My insurance cover's one pair a year.Being behind a year I bought these for a back-up pair.Dr. R.,my podiatrist said was impressed with Amazon's price.If you need a dependable,comfortable shoe I recommend these whether you are diabetic or not.They may be more costly than some brands of casual/sport shoes but,they are strong and provide good protection.You can buy a cheaper shoe and have to replace them more often or get these and keep on truckin long after the others would  have worn bottoms.My opinion...5AUG15	2015-08-05

I have narrow feet, and it's really hard to find flats that stay on my foot.  Usually, if they stay on my foot at the heel, my toes are smashed at the front.  So for just wearing them to work and walking to and from the car, and to and from the bathroom at work, they were great.  However, I went outside to walk around at lunch for a half hour, and by the end of my walk, I had blisters on both ankles such that I couldn't walk anymore, and had to take them off of my ankle and limp back to my office to get bandaids for my ankles.  So the fact that they stay on my heel is nice, but I guess the snug fit on the heel is not good for walking too much :(.	2015-08-05

As they are a little tight and are defiantly going to cause blisters as they are now because the material isn't very soft. These shoes are defiantly not for someone that has wide feet.

I want to go all Imelda Marcos and buy several different shoes from Salomon, they have so many cool styles.  I can't afford them yet, but they are well worth the price.  I strongly recommend keeping an eye on your favorite style.  They usually sell for over $100 but I've seen them drop as low as $60, and that is a fantastic price to pay for these.	2015-08-05

I was EFFING PISSED. Then they make the soles out of the s***tiest foam rubber now, the soles squish and flatten out in another week, and they're too big. Biggest waste of $50 you'll regret ever buying Reef, Quiksilver (probably Hurley too although I've never owned a pair) or any of the other big box surf brands. I'm a Havaianas wearer for life now, I hope they Never change their recipe though.	2015-08-05

They are a little more narrow than a regular shoe, this is due in part to the fleece lining; so if you have wide feet, this may not be the one for you.  I however have narrow feet, and they fit great! Very comfortable and warm. My feet will sweat after a while, but I expected that as my last pair of slippers was lined with lambs wool and they did the same thing. I'm hot natured, but my feet stay cold, so I don't mind this; plus you can wash the liners, which is a definite plus!  I normally wear a mens 12 in boots, and a 13 in sneakers; so I went with the 13's and I'm glad I did.  The 12's would have been way to small.  So, If you are on the border line of going up a size, definitely order the larger one.  My house is also off the ground, so boots etc., make a lot of noise when walking, these however, are Very quiet! (This is Great since I have an infant). I like that there are only 2 holes on the top instead of the usual top full of holes, as I can walk through the yard and not worry about getting my feet wet.  Hope this review helps!	2015-08-05

ME:  5'2&#34;, 105 lbs, short but extra wide feet - on average I wear a size 6.5 but typically with grown-up shoes I have to settle for a 7 in order to get the width I need (unless offered in wide width).<br />REASON PURCHASED:  Wedding Party shoe color contest<br /><br />YAYS<br />1.  SO comfortable - around the house only thus far<br />2.  Accommodating for wide feet!<br />3.  Color is even better in person!<br />4.  Material is extremely soft<br />5.  The price - seriously, I wish I had more weddings on my calendar!<br /><br />NAYS<br />1. Ankle looseness - I do wish they gave me stability in the ankle area but for this price and the amount of wear they'll likely get, fo'get about it.<br /><br />I think last time I wore heels they were almost always called &#34;pumps&#34; and the word &#34;wedge&#34; was slang for an uncomfortable underwear situation.<br />Okay ... maybe it wasn't *that* long ago, but even at my 5'2&#34; stature I am unquestionably a flats girl at heart.  Exceptions, of course, must be made, particularly when the word Bridesmaid is in play.  I can't believe I even considered these shoes at such a height but I was so obsessed with the Lime Green that I glazed over the wobble warnings.  The moment I opened the box my heart fluttered and while I was semi-mortified by the ever present elevation of my new lovely-lime ladies, I was motivated to make it work.  I can't get over how comfortable they are and although I know comfort has a shelf life, I'll be in flops by then anyway :)<br /><br />Seriously, don't let the low price throw you ... these are the real deal!	2015-08-05

The color on these is as pictured, they are more of a coral than a red.  I am a fan of Vibram, no arch support but that is the way barefoot is supposed to be.  This color gets noticed way more than my fushia or black pair and starts a lot of discussions. My foot and ankle muscles have definitely improve as a result of wearing them regularly.  I tend to wear out the outside edge of normal shoes and if I don't replace them in time I end up rolling my ankle in a misstep.  Since I can't wear these down I feel more stable and have less stumbling incidents from uneven shoe wear.	2015-08-05

It's not a big deal if you don't mind relacing them every time you put them on, but if you're pinched for time they are a hastle.<br />Secondly, they do run small. I normally wear a 5 in tennis shoes and 6 in heels, I bought a 6 expecting it to work, but they were UNCOMFORTABLEY tight.<br />Thirdly, these boots DO NO LAST. I bought these because it's hard to find thigh high boots that aren't ungodly expensive. Apparently these boots are so cheap because they are cheaply made. I wore these boots ONCE and the right boot started to separate from the platform.<br /><br />The one good thing I can say is that amazon promptly refunded my money and accepted a return.	2015-08-05

I think all have been from Amazon, I would never pay full price for them.  Love Manitobah boots, so cute and cozy warm.  Got the charcoal gray. The only thing I don't like about these is the pom poms - maybe I am getting a little too old to have pom poms swinging from my boots.  Going to leave them alone for now, can always cut them off if they don't work out.  Otherwise, the boots are nice quality.  I bought the lower cut pair last year, wore them all thru the winter, and they still look great ( even tho I never got around to spraying them ) so I know these will hold up well.  I agree with other reviews that fleece lining would be nice.  Definitely size down unless you plan on wearing with thick socks.  From my experience, the suede Manitobahs all run a size bigger.  The leather boots are true to size.<br /><br />They will be awesome with leggings or skinny jeans, can't wait for the cold weather!	2015-08-05

She wore them around the house for a few hours and had indentations where the straps were, so we returned them.  If we go a size bigger they would be too long for her feet, and I didn't want to make her wear them in the hopes they would stretch.  Regular Crocs fit her fine.  I guess if your kid has really thin, pancake-like feet these would be work?	2015-08-05

I wear a size 9 1/2 in a regular shoe and 10 to 10 1/2 for running shoes. I bought these in a 10 and they fit fine with my thinner running socks but are too tight with thicker socks. The shoes are also narrow which is great for my narrow feet. If you have wide feet they will not work for you.<br /><br />For function, I used them during a bike trip where we averaged 35 miles per day on hybrid bikes with flat pedals. The shoes were comfortable and transferred energy efficiently to the pedals. They are also useful for light hiking with reasonably sticky soles.<br /><br />The shoes are good looking. I chose a color combination that I liked and happened to be steeply discounted. I would definitely buy again.	2015-08-05

Wow! These shoes still stink WEEKS after I bought them and took them out of the box to air out. They are good looking shoes and a good price. They also fit well. But there is no way that I will ever be able to pack them with any other clothes. They reek of a heavy chemical smell that must be a part of creating the shoe.

They are a nice upgrade from flip flops but just as easy to wear.

I'm not qualified to review these boots from the perspective of a knowledgeable hiker; I purchased these in the hopes of getting my first pair of reasonable boots to begin the transition from day hikes to real hikes, and boy have they excelled so far.<br /><br />In Florida, there isn't much rocky/steep terrain to test these against, but they've definitely proven they can keep grip in the wet stuff. Which is good, because you run into a lot of wet stuff around here. The waterproofing has so far proven true to the advertising. I haven't treated these with mink oil (yet) but for the one hike they've been out on, they've kept my socks dry even in two inch deep water.<br /><br />Lately I've been breaking them in by wearing them during a normal day and they have succeeded in giving me confidence that I can wear them for a full 14 hours without feeling worn out or getting sore, tired feet. With high arches, I do experience a bit of fatigue late in the day, but it's mitigated by the lacing options of the boots.<br /><br />The lacing eyelets seem to follow what I would expect to see on a hiep terrain king boot. I've no other previous boots to base my experience on but the hot button issue with these seems to be the quick lacing eyelets for the ankle and the quality of them. So far, I've approached them cautiously, but even with a good tightening they seem to hold sturdy.	2015-08-05

I usually wear a size 8 1/2 in other brands but I get a 9 in these; I tried an 8 once & it was wearable but it just wasn't as comfortable.	2015-08-05

It's small so just wallet, phone and few small stuff and also some envelopes fit nicely. The colour is pretty. The studs don't look too much. There is no rubber edging, which peels off after a while, so I like that. It even has the metal stubs at the bottom so the bag does not come into contact with the surface it's on. It is quite sturdy and it does not look cheap. However, the interior material does not seem like a durable quality - that's the only con for me. It's just right for me and I would recommend to anyone looking for a small satchel.	2015-08-05

I thought I was SO cool for having the same shoes as Benny &#34;The Jet&#34; Rodriguez.<br /><br />Then I became a teenager, and wanted to wear Vans—to fit in—and I did, for many, many years. And I LOVED them. For ten years of my life, I wore Vans Prison Issues—with additional insoles. Then, THEN... Then those jerks at Vans discontinued MY shoe—and I had to choose a new one.<br /><br />I re-stumbled upon PF Flyers—and read up on them—not just their history as a Sandlot icon—but how they build their insoles. Around this same time, I was living with an orthopedic massage therapist, and having knee problems. She mentioned that wearing insoles for so many years probably trained my feet/ankles/knees to not be able to support themselves properly (because the insole was doing it instead of my own body), and that I should wean myself off of insoles.<br /><br />So I ordered a pair of PF Flyers, and decided to wean myself off of Doctor Scholes.<br /><br />My life is so much better now. I have FAR less ankle/knee pain—and I can wear these shoes all day long. And I still feel cool wearing PF Flyers.	2015-08-05

Just came back from 10 days in Park City, Utah. I ordered the Salomon Fellraiser, Solomon XR Mission, and the Merrell Moab's to try. I have a small, narrow foot with a high arch and found the Fellraiser to be the most comfortable. I took them on my trip without wearing them first, which typically would be a terrible decision.... but these shoes are fantastic! We hiked up and down the mountains in Utah for 9 days in a row and these shoes never hurt my feet. I did put in my own insoles to add to the arch support, but there was no rubbing, blistering, etc. For a brand new hiking shoe, with no breaking in, these were even better than I could have imagined. They fit like regular running shoes and I was able to wear them with my regular athletic socks. Because of the mesh, they do get really dirty and the dirt comes right through to the sock. Overall these shoes were perfect for what I needed! Comfortable, good non-slip soles, and rugged!	2015-08-05

They are great shoes to own. They smell like berries and do cater to my &#34;ooh look, shiny shoes&#34; appeal. I own a few Melissa shoes but none of them were with a closed curved toe so my review is on what to expect when buying melissa slipper flats.<br /><br />These shoes are the same sizing as other Melissa shoes (such as Melissa/Vivienne Westwood lines) so whatever size you are in that line, you will be with this. I am a true size 6.5 and I wear a Melissa size 6 so if you are a size 6.5 in regular shoes-order the 6.<br /><br />Since these shoes are curved and narrow at the toe, you may feel a bit uncomfortable at first and think you will need a larger size (which is what I did at first) but DO NOT get a larger size because of your toes. Stick with what you would normally wear and when you wear them, they will begin to feel more comfortable.<br /><br />So if you are a size 6.5, order the 6. DO NOT step up.<br />I ordered a size 6 and exchanged it for a 7 because I was concerned about the toe area, thinking that it would give enough room for my toes and they were too large so now I am exchanging and ordering back to a size 6.<br /><br />The thing with these shoes is that tight is better as they bend and mold to your foot.<br /><br />I hope this helps with anyone who wants to order a pair. Definitely worth having!	2015-08-05

This is a great set of 3 fold-able reading glasses that are lightweight and very nice looking. My wife wanted some additional sets to have around the house, we really, really hate getting to the age that we need multiple frames lying around the house!!  They each come in a hard case that the glasses fold neatly into.   I had purchase several folding glasses and I like the ones that have a telescoping frame that goes over your ears that extends out for wearing and slides back when you fold them up to put them away.  These have a solid frame that folds on itself.  I hate getting older and needing reading glasses all the time, but I put a pair of these in my pocket without the hard case.    These were great fold-able glasses and I was very impressed with the telescoping design.

When he opened the box and saw the Converse red sneakers, his eyes lit up, and he exclaimed, &#34;My favorite color.&#34;  He wore the sneakers around the house for awhile.  He said they were comfortable.  He said he loved them.  He then took them off, and carefully put them back in the box, and said he would save them for kindergarten. (He will begin Kindergarten the second week in September.)  I am pleased that I will send off this darling, little boy to Kindergarten in bright red sneakers.  These Converse sneakers are well made, comfortable, and for a five-year old little boy, bright red.  Amazon Verified Purchase.	2015-08-05

I wear an inbetween size 8.5 to a 9 and the 9 was sold out (I purchased them at belks) so I got an 8.5 which fits me good and I somewhat have wide feet but I fit most medium width shoes without a problem. I wish I could've gotten a size 9 instead but 8.5 is doable. So yes, I would recommend that you'll size up and definitely try them on first before purchased. I can't wait to wear them out, I wore them about the house and they're pretty comfy (for a flat sandal of course, I wouldn't wear these on days I plan a lot of walking). They're super classy and doesn't look cheap and goes with most things, I love the gold buckle and hardware detail! I posted pictures so you can how they look on my semi wide feet! They're narrow like Kate spade shoes if you own any of her shoes to give you an idea.	2015-08-05

We bought these shoes in April and they started falling apart within 2 weeks.  The canvas is wearing all around the opening.  The toe guard is coming apart in small bits and the stitching starting falling right at the start of week two.  the canvas is no longer blue - it is all faded.<br />The insole liner separated from the insole foam piece.  My 3 year old son has used the shoes almost every at preschool since we got them.  However, based on the 5 other pairs of pediped shoes he had previously, we excepted the shoes to last until he outgrew them after 6-9 months of intense play.  The other Pediped shoes lasted a long time.  These shoes have been a disappointment and we are now looking at switching to another brand.	2015-08-05

Before posting my review please not that my purse is the same one as pictured. I noticed other purses have buckle straps with pink lining and even black trim going around the lining. I also see the buckle straps ones have an outside keychain, mine does not. Since they are showing verified purchase, they received the item the same way I did, however, mine was supplied to me by the vendor in exchange for an honest review. I don't know why the black purses have different linings, colors, handles, key chains. Perhaps the vendor can address this issue.<br /><br />I get nervous ordering purses off of Amazon since they are usually shipped folded up. I have had a lot of purses ruined due to this. I was happy this was synthetic since the material would probably handle a fold over. The day this purse was delivered, it was jammed in my mailbox, folded in half. I feared it would never take shape but it immediately did.<br /><br />I like that it has a protective purse case over it. This is great for storing when not in use. I accidentally moved with some purses all in a plastic container and they all got stuck together where the material and colors came off. After that, I learned to make sure each one has a protective bag over it.<br /><br />I do not see it notated so wanted to mention the bag has gold tone hardware. It looks really nice against the material and I someone who prefers silver tone hardware. It makes it look classy. Also, in the inner liner in the picture almost looks black. In person it is very clearly a chocolate/mocha color. I will be posting pictures to show you.<br /><br />The first think I loved was there is a key link where you can easily find your keys by clipping them on a strap. This is perfect for someone like me. I have the biggest keys around so I don't lose them. However, I still seem to lose them in my purse. I can be searching forever trying to find them even though they are huge. This will eliminate that and save a lot of time. It will save time digging through my purse in a parking lot or in public which is a safety issues so that is my favorite part. I love the outer pocket; it comes in handy for a shopping list if you have the inside part all zipped up. I can be lazy and keep the bag unzipped, it stays closed though, and there is more than enough room for all of my stuff. People who know me know I carry everything but the kitchen sink. I don't know if it is because I like to be prepared or if it is because I am a mom. If someone needs something, I usually have it in my bag.<br /><br />The inner pockets are perfect for my lip gloss, gum, phone, and anything I might need nearby and handy. The inside of the bag is very roomy which comes in handy with all my stuff. After you fill the bag, you could even place a scarf at the top or drape it over and it does not get bulky.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this bag. The only think I would change is the material of the lining. I am used to something a bit softer and this seems almost paper like and I fear I might tear/rip the lining, which I have not done so in the past but fear it might happen with this bag. Since it has not ripped, I can't say it is an issue.or in public which is a safety issues so that is my favorite part.

I bought these for my two and a half year old daughter because she is great at putting on her own shoes as long as they have Velcro. My only other requirement in a shoe for her is that they do not have character branding on them. These shoes are perfect because the colors are reminiscent of her favorite characters but the shoes are &#34;face-free&#34;. Also, the sparkly glitter is perfect for that princess feel. (The glitter does not flake off-another plus!)	2015-08-05

I also love the light color for summer. A great shoe.	2015-08-05

The shoes just arrived a few days ago so I have not worn them out of doors, just for &#34;practicing&#34; in the house.  So far, I really like them.  They are a terrific looking pair of casual shoes and were comfy for the couple of hours I had them on.  They are my first pair of Ecco shoes, but my husband prefers that brand above all others, for his own casual wear, so I expect them to wear well serve me for several years, as his do.  I was a bit hesitant about the color (a pale, greyish green) but absolutely love it.	2015-08-05

The best until recent years when each new pair I bought did not feel exactly right in the foot bed. I have wide feet and have to wear a wide width (4E), so those out there can surmise what the brand is without me directly saying so. Not sure if I can here! I was increasingly put off by the quality of this brand and their lack of correct fit and decided it was time to see what else is out there for wide widths since my feet ached more and more wearing them, no matter what model I tried.  I came across this shoe and I will never look back. I wear them everyday to the gym and walking and running on the treadmill for an hour is a total pleasure. Walking around on pavement for shopping and running chores, these behave just the same, very comfortable with great arch support and cushioning. I've worn these everyday for a good 2 months now and look forward to wearing them for many more.  I'm a new fan of Asics thanks to these shoes and look forward to staying with this brand for good.	2015-08-05

I like the sock fit feel though it is a little weird that I can see the outline of my toes through the stretchy upper fabric. Only negative in terms of comfort is the plastic lace hole on the inner side of the shoe. If my socks don't come up high enough to cover my ankle there I get blisters from the hard part rubbing against my skin. The sole is very grippy which helps when working out on wood floors. Great fit for people with thin feet.	2015-08-05

I ordered these for my father who has feet that are extremely high arched and swell which requires deep access when buying shoes. The stretch material works very well and goes all the way up the tongue on the MPED3 Pedwalker 3 shoe. I had also purchased the propet pediwalker 15 with the trim on the sides but unfortunately the tongue of those shoes have vinyl on it and did not allow foot to slid in or stretch. I choose to modified the propet pediwalker 15 by slitting the vinyl part of tongue to allow access but he will have to wear black socks as it is very close to being seen. I hope the company will change this in the future. I am so glad I could find a shoe that provided a more dressier look over the basic velcro tennis shoe options out there which are also often very heavy. These shoes are very light.	2015-08-05

The first pair, I was provided poor fitment information from another website, so I ordered a size bigger than needed (I would have only gone a half-size bigger, but it's tough to find a 12.5).  I didn't return them because I only paid like, $35 for them and I wore them for about a year.  When those started to wear out, i was ready to re-buy them but at the correct size.  I would have preferred a color besides black/black, but they still look good, and are pretty subdued in the looks department.<br /><br />Super comfortable, soft, cushioned sole and insole.  Not really designed for running, they're a phenomenal travel shoe.  Easy on/off thanks to the Salomon closure system, and exceptionally comfortable for long days spent schlepping around a foreign city.  I feel like I could wear these shoes for 16 hours straight.<br /><br />Sadly, it doesn't appear that Salomon are releasing an updated version of it, but that's life.  Get em while you can.	2015-08-05

I have had them for over a month now and they have started creasing. You cannot get rid of the creases. Also, the sole seems a bit cheap. It seems as though they mixed plastic with the rubber. The stitching for the zipper is also a bit cheap. I wouldn't use the zipper to avoid breaking it. Just slip them on and off while losening the strings. The colored portion of the shoe is not really furry. Although this makes them easy to clean, it also makes them look cheap. The shoe runs wide, but I would get a true to size fit unless you have really narrow feet. Overall, you get what you pay for. I wouldn't buy this shoe again.	2015-08-05

These are my first crocs.  I have avoided crocs because they are big clown shoes in appearance and I didn't want look like a ...you know.  I finally bought a pair because I am now swimming regularly and needed shoes that could get wet at the pool.  I hate flip flops, which abrade the tender area between big toe and second toe.  Well, I bought the crocs and they are awesome!  Very comfortable.  I have arthritis in my feet and the crocs are surprisingly supportive.  I wear them for long drives.  They are great at the dog park or in the back yard where I am likely to step in something that is very difficult to clean off sneakers but comes off easily with a hose or a wipe from my clogs.  Best of all, I look cool in them, and I know this because the younger generation is impressed.  Not the 20 somethings, who tend to roll their eyes, or my contemporaries who look askance and ask if I have been gardening but the stylesetters of tomorrow.  I wore them to the beach and a toddler and a four year old both patted my shoes. Now I want crocs in every color of the rainbow.	2015-08-05

I shouldn't have been because I'm sure the size is listed but its not quite a small wallet and its not quite a full length, its in between.  The color is nice.  However, the leather against leather makes it a pain to close every time.  It doesn't glide so if you miss align the snaps you can't just easily readjust, you have to open and close it again because the leathers pull against each other.<br /><br />Additionally, the color on the inside has already started to fade inside the crease.

Bought these boots as I wanted them for work boots as I am on my feet all day and someone told me about these boots. I got the boots and they are very comfortable and I seriously cant get through the day without them. I was a bit nervous about buying them as a lot of people have had issues with them peeling or cracking but I figured I would get them either way and I wish I would listened to the other reviews. After about wearing them 5-6 times within a month, the boots started to crack on the side and now the sole is seperating from the shoe. I ONLY WORE THEM A HANDFUL OF TIMES AND THEY START TO CRACK? I contacted UA and they said they would exchange them but I got to pay to ship them back and not be with the shoes for 5-9 business days. It's nice they will exchange them but now I have to pay more money to get a product that should of lasted me a few months. I will not buy these again and if you are reading this, you probably shouldn't either but you can roll the dice on them as I will not.	2015-08-05

Very comfortable.<br /><br />I live on a farm and have shoes for all the various chores that need to be done.  Most of them have to be taken off and left in the mud room so that I don't track stuff through the house.  I also keep a pair of shoes in the mud room that are suitable to slip on on the fly to run errands, a pair that won't make me look like I just jumped from the back of a 'cabbage truck.'  When my current Clark's used for this purpose wear out, I think I'll replace them with this Evianna Peal style.	2015-08-05

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these shoes and wish I could get them for free!! (hint, hint!!)- But I paid full price for them, and have since bought about 4 more pairs. If you live in a warm climate or you're traveling and need comfy shoes with good arch support, these are WELL WORTH the price!! I live in Florida, so I wear these shoes literally every day. I'm on my feet all day- and because I have lower back issues, I cannot wear cheap flip-flops- I have to wear shoes and sandals with arch and back support, and these are the best I've found. I love the blue color as well as the olive green (for winter) and the coral as well. I'm now on my 6th pair- I keep a good pair for going out and I keep an older pair for hacking around the lake, beach, and house. I also bought a pair for a pregnant friend of mine, and she loves them!!! They're the only shoes she wears for her back support!	2015-08-05

The pockets are so useless, my previous way of organizing my purse by having different little zipped bags for similar items, was more effective.  Now I have a several items piled in the middle, and only a few items in the pockets, because using one side, renders the other side useless for most normal items found in a purse (I removed some of the items in the middle for the purpose of a clear photo). Organization fail.  Maybe they stretch over time?  I was trying to go more &#34;upscale,&#34; but there are tons of options that look more functional for a fraction of the cost of this one.  I gave it 2 stars because I like the look of this organizer, but I'm afraid it has to go back.	2015-08-05

Honestly, I was a little skeptical when I saw the photo online but I figured why not. Two days later, I receive the package and the shoes look even better in person! They run a little narrow in the toe area but it fits my feet perfectly. The fabric doesn't look cheap and the heel isn't that high, making the shoes super comfortable! I work in a hospital and these are perfect for business-wear as well as casual wear. Mix it with slacks, jeans, skirts, even dresses! It's a must buy!	2015-08-05

That being said, these shoes are great for him. They are the first shoes with a real sole that I bought for my son after he started walking as his main mode of transportation. (While he was mostly crawling, but able to stand and take a few steps on occasion, I had him wear pre-walkers.) He doesn't have any difficulty walking in them and they don't seem to cause him discomfort.<br /><br />From a parent's perspective, they are easy to get on his foot and they stay on while he's walking.	2015-08-05

I will only ever buy polarized glasses for so many reasons. The pair that I have had for about 15 years now, need replacing, I did not want to give them up, but there are a couple of spots on the lenses that are right in my view. So, when I was given the chance to review these at a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest review, I decided to go ahead and give them a try. I am rather very picky with certain things and sunglasses are one of those things. My eyes are extremely sensitive to light and I need to make sure that I have a high quality of lens to help reduce that sensitivity. With that said, these live up to my pickiness. The frames and lens combined are extremely lightweight and feel perfect on my face. They are quite stylish and seem very durable. Very happy to have these and be able to use them any time I am in the sun.<br /><br />As far as the polarized lens goes, they are amazing! As I mentioned, I have owned a pair for 15 years. I have used them during winter, spring, summer and fall. I have worn them to reduce glare from the snow, the sun, glares off of cars or buildings. Even glare from the road, water or anything that will shine into your eyes unexpectedly. Honestly, you have to own a pair of polarized lens glasses. These are so stylish and gorgeous! They even come in a great protective box, wrapped in their own drawstring bag. This seller/company has gone all out to make sure that you are happy with their product, even including a nice Thank You note in the box.	2015-08-05

I work 9 hour days (almost all of it on my feet) and I don't have as much feet pain as I previously did.  I still have pain at the end of the day, but it has been a noticeable improvement from my previous shoes/boots.<br /><br />I've had them for about 4 months now (and worn them every day) and they have been very rugged.  I haven't noticed the soul detaching, insole separating or holes/tears forming.  Unless water goes over the top of my ankle, they appear to be waterproof.<br /><br />That being said, my one complaint is that there is no significant support where my toes are.  I work with dogs and after one dog (about 70 pounds) stepped on the toe of these shoes there has been an indention ever since.  I've tried pushing it back out, but as soon as any little bit of weight is reapplied, the indention reforms.  So, while I do like these shoes a lot and they have been a major improvement for me - if your job runs a risk of something heavy dropping on your feet, you definitely need something with more support.	2015-08-05

I bought these for my fiance who works outdoors doing all sorts of crazy things in every weather condition imaginable. I asked him about how he likes the boots, and he says &#34;I bought a size 8 so they would be wide enough for my feet.

I want to get like gel insoles cause they aren't the softest to be just standing on. I've worn them 10-14 hours and only start hurting near the end but that's just fatigue.&#34; So there you have it. You can wear them all day, they aren't as comfortable as tennis shoes but that's how boots are, so if you have sensitive feet or know you have had issues before, you may want an insole of some kind. Having said that, he wears them for very long periods and has no issues with his feet (no bunions, no blisters, nothing like that).<br /><br />They aren't made specifically for arch support, and he says &#34;These don't really have a huge arch support. Just enough for me to know I have it there but nothing that really sticks out if you have high arches.&#34; So there you go.<br /><br />Having said that, he got very sad when the shoes started to scuff because he said they look so nice. ;) That's what happens when you work! But yes, he loves them. I also have composite toe boots and I will say, I have dropped 200lbs of sand directly on my toe and had nothing happen (I didn't even feel it). They are a must-have for people who work around heavy stuff that might fall on their toes.	2015-08-05

They fit well except for the top strap over the instep is too tight.  I am hoping it will stretch out a bit.  I am at a desk most of the day so I can wear them all day but walking in them for a long period of time would be impossible because of the strap.  The high heel is not a problem.	2015-08-05

He's never worn shoes before( we live in the south) and fussed every time I tried a pair in him. He had a wide foot with a high arch and even the stride rite extra wide shoes didn't work for him. These are perfect and he didn't fuss when I put them on him. They are the perfect combination of a crib shoe and sandal.	2015-08-05

My favorite part of the packaging was this little quote that came inside the box (I have attached a picture).<br /><br />The frames are very durable and the parts of it that are chromed don't look like they were chrome plated, they look like the real deal. (You know how somethings are plated with metal and they just scream: tacky, halloween accessory, 99 cents, etc.? these don't look like that).<br /><br />These glasses easily look like they would  be ~$50, they look nothing like the glasses at our local swap meet that are the same cost.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-05

Regardless, I know they'll work-in and be fine. What I didn't realize until finding the info on a website one day (can't remember where) was there's a chart for figuring out what style of Asics is best for you (Nimbus, Kayano, etc.).  I'd always loved the Nimbus and found out it was what I was supposed to be wearing.  Have worn Asics for 30 years and am an avid fan. And it doesn't hurt that this model is the Seahawks colors...

Been a supporter of Nimbus since the beginning but they are getting cheaper with the materials.

I specifically purchased these to wear for about 10 hours per day while at work as an engineer, with the plan/idea that they would &#34;breath&#34; better than my all-leather work boots.

Love these boots more than recent 8 Second Angels, more than recent Independent Boot Co. Soft leather, more subtle details and beauty than pictures can show. Stable foot bed, haven't noticed slippery soles yet ,haven't gone to grocery store either.  Hate when I have to hang onto cart to keep slippery soles under me. Can't tell really how true the fit is, will depend on your job? After 12 hours of nursing they fit great! On a day off, upon waking they might be a half size too large? I hope the toe style changes soon, I do not like these pointed then snipped ends, but boots on a whole are prettier than I anticipated. Distressed enough to not have the shelf glare, just enough to look new but how new? Just the way I like them. Amazon price, you rock, saved 40% from another boot site. Wouldn't have gotten them any other way. I work too hard to spend that kind of money on a pair of boots.	2015-08-05

I thought that others that had reviewed this product and said they fell apart might have gotten defective shoes from a bad lot.  I decided to take a chance and order these shoes.  I went on vacation and wore them for about an hour and the soles of my shoes started to fall apart. When I went in the water, the innersoles came out of the shoes when I removed them from my feet.  I would have returned them to Amazon, but I didn't want to bring them back from vacation.  I just threw them in the trash.	2015-08-05

It is a little odd looking when you first put them on, but walking around in them they look very cute. This shoe can give the appearance of making the foot look larger though, so it would be best to go by the size chart provided. I am normally 8-8.5 but I ordered a 7.5 and that was a perfect fit. I haven't walked around in them for longer than a couple of hours so I cannot speak on how comfortable they are for all day wear, but they were comfy for the hours I wore them and my feet weren't sore afterwards.  -edit-  took away a star as I expected the shoe to become more comfortable, but it has left me with some aches. I think I may return. They're very cute though :/	2015-08-05

It is a cute shoes, but the stones are very colorful. I thought they are just a crystal white, but their color would change& most of the times are purple& red....

Hello Superfeet!<br /><br />While I ordered the correct size, I found that the arch of the insole is farther forward than my actual arch is.  In order to have my arch meet the arch of the insole I would have to wear them with my foot at least a half inch forward of the heel cup.  Either way, the insole is uncomfortable for me.  I asked another family member to try them on, we wear about the same size shoe, and they had the same issue.  I opted to return the insoles.<br /><br />Having said that, they do seem to be very well constructed, I found the width to be perfect for me (I wear a N width), and with the current return policy, I am considering ordering another style.<br /><br />Update:  Based on my experience with the return, I will not be ordering another pair.	2015-08-05

I used to think that shoes were just made to wear out quickly until I got a pedometer.  I learned that I walk between 23,000 and 27,000 steps per week day at work which for my stride as a 6'2&#34; adult male is about 15 miles per day Saturdays are usually around 20,000 steps or 13 miles.<br /><br />I have worn these shoes almost everyday except for Sunday for the past 7 months. I figure a low estimate for the mileage on these shoes is about 1300-1800 miles.  I weigh 195 lbs so realize that I'm not exactly stepping lightly... Most of my walking is on asphalt or concrete so also understand that they arent exactly on a smooth surface most of the time.<br /><br />The soles are obviously showing signs of wear but there is still decent tread left.  The insoles are starting to get a little uncomfortable but still bearable.  The exterior fabrics on the shoes are dirty but not overly worn out. I do welding on occasion and there are a few small holes on the tops of the shoes where molten metal has burnt through (that feels good on the feet...), but the holes haven't even enlarged over time.<br /><br />Overall I would say that I only recommend these to those who want ridiculously long lasting, comfortable, and durable shoes. If you want less,  look elsewhere.<br /><br />They may cost a little more than the discount shoes at big 5 but they last much longer than anything else I have tried.	2015-08-05

Already had a pair of these for the last two years, but couldn't find them in a local shop since then.  Happy to find them on Amazon.  Some reviews said the sizing was too small when they got theirs, but I ordered the same size I already had previously and am happy to say, they was still the perfect fit.  The questions ask if the shoe provided good arch support... I don't think you really buy a flip flop for arch support, but I have a bad back and these are a solid inch of pure cushion!!	2015-08-05

Also, because my calves are lower than average because of my height, the calves of the boots don't match up to mine and wind up being too tight with the ankles too loose. I also recommend sizing up in the foot. Most boots I've found run a size smaller than flats and heels and these are no exception. I usually wear a 6 and got these in a 7. The foot fit well.	2015-08-05

One of the side pocket snaps had loose stitching and came off within 5 minutes of opening the package.  Straps dig in at the point where your arm meets the shoulder.  Extra spotted canvas comes out at a point on the straps where it should curve.  I have bruises on both upper arms where it dug in. Overall design isn't great.

Vivobarefoot is known for their running, hiking, and lifestyle/dress shoes for minimalist/barefoot lovers.<br /><br />I've own the Dharma, Jay, and Gobi from Vivobarefoot and love them all. This new Mata, which costs more than the Dharma and Jay of previous years is a mix of the two. It has a sleeker look than the split toe Dharma, but the minimalist construction and firmer leather of the Jay. It has a very minimalist construction and is very lightweight and flexible.<br /><br />I wish that the sole wasn't the color of fishing gear (all black would be appreciated), but it's an overall nice looking shoe.<br /><br />The sizing is a bit on the smaller side, perhaps one EU size smaller than expected.	2015-08-05

They were perfect for my needs. The pair I received fit true-to-size, though I did try on pairs in different colors in stores, and I noticed that they some colors fit differently (a bit on the small side), so it seems it is not always consistent. The &#34;parachute&#34; color is a deep, grape-y purple, which I liked. In this color, my normal size fit, though I was concerned at first that they were a tad short. It felt like there was no room in the heel to spare at all. After wearing them around my house a bit, I realized that I was feeling the contoured ridge on my heel- not the edge of the shoe. I have worn them many times now, and the fit is truly perfect. However, in another color (I think it was black), the pair in my normal size rubbed my toes (which does not happen with my purple ones), but the next 1/2 size up was too big. So that color would not have worked. Since I was fortunate enough to receive a pair that fit perfectly, I am very happy with these shoes. They are very easy to get on/off and adjust with the bungee. They were comfortable to wear on hikes, but I also just wore them around trekking town. They feel like sneakers, but keep my feet nice and cool. I like that the tow guard gives some coverage, but doesn't encase too much of my toes. I did not do too much in the water with them yet, but they were fine for what little I did in small streams and riversides.<br />I purchased these for myself after my child had been wearing her pair for a few weeks and just loves them. She calls them her &#34;summer sneakers&#34;, and that really is a good way to describe them, since they have much of the functionality of sneakers but the coolness of a sandal. I usually wear flip-flops all summer, but I have found myself throwing these on when I would otherwise have worn a sneaker. I really enjoy these, and am thinking about getting another, lighter color so I can have a pair that would work with other clothes, too.th other clothes, too.	2015-08-05

I don't believe it is enough to order a size up though.<br /><br />One last thing to keep in mind, the toe area will easily snag and fold under if you have a lazy foot, or snag it on something, so just be aware of that.	2015-08-05

However, these shoes are WAY too wide. Having read all the reviews, I ordered a half size down (8.5) and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, there is no way I can wear these. I have narrow, flexible, flat feet, and if you do too, don't think that just ordering down is going to help much. I should have known better, but I really liked the look and the color (dark green), plus the price was just too tempting.<br /><br />Aside from sizing, they were great looking and very well made, as is typical with Easy Spirit shoes. If you have a wide foot with a high instep, you should grab these!	2015-08-05

I have been a lover of this model of the New Balance shoes for years, unfortunately I ordered these from Amazon and within 50 miles of running the top of the shoe wore and created a cut on my ankle.

My biggest problem with the shoe is the WIDE entrance, non-rigid tops, and the unnecessarily large heel. It feels like a woman's heel and even looks a bit pointy. It's stylish to a degree but it begins to become painful because of the loose opening. Depending on how you walk, you'll find yourself hitting everything heel first in a very annoying tap-dancing way. This process begins to put tension on your heels and will tire you out. It looks good but it doesn't function well.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />I don't recommend this model and I think you'll find comfort in a different one. In my opinion, it begins to have feminine aspects that will eat at your conscious because you want to look good and feel good in quality boots.	2015-08-05

I have bought tons of shoes trying to find the one that feels great on my feet when I stand for 12+ hours a day. These do the trick. Plus they are easy to keep clean and dry.

Getting them off isn't as bad as I expected although there is no heal to lever against so I'm sure that the sole will begin peeling loose in short order, especially since it is glued on and not sewn.<br /><br />Two big gripes with this boot:  Unless you are Captain Hook, good luck getting a digit in the pull strap.  I mean really, who checks this stuff at the factory?  It's all I can do to get the tip of my finger in, I'm going to have to fab up a metal hook to aid in putting these on.  The absence of a front strap is a major oversight.<br /><br />Gripe number two is there is zero arch support in this shoe.  Did they use retired NYPD flat foots to design this thing?  They are decent to wear for a couple hours and there is so little room inside I don't think you could get away with adding an insert or arch support.<br /><br />So to sum it up, for $50 it's a pretty decent boot that would work well for short stints of light wear.  You will probably spend more time writhing on the floor trying to don and doff them than you will actually wearing the darn things.  FYI I'm from the city of Eugene of which the boot is named so I am eminently qualified to review it I think!	2015-08-05

My fault....I should have &#34;tried it on&#34; in person before purchasing.  The handles are too short to make it a comfortable shoulder bag and it NEEDS to be a shoulder bag.

Also, the material the bag is made of is so stiff around the top of the bag, it will practically cut you when you are trying to find something inside.

I was critical as the some reviews mention feet sliding forward, I have not noticed this issue compared to any other wedge sandal I've worn.

I wasn't a big fan of flip flops until I bought these. I only bought them because they were good looking and different than the usual flip-flops, on clearance. I use them all the time, the circle top part of the sandal somehow works like a suction cup and hugs your foot nicely. The soles are so comfortable and squishy.<br /><br />Best flip-flops when I drive my stick shift vehicle because of how it hugs my foot. I have other types of Sanuk shoes. I admitted to my husband that I can live the rest of my life only purchasing Sanuk and my feet will be very happy.<br /><br />I let my best friend try my flip flops on and her expression on how comfortable they are was priceless. She even yelled with a smile on her face saying I am definitely right.<br /><br />I read somewhere that they were great for going in the water with, I am NOT sure, I have not tried it yet.	2015-08-05

I bought them without trying a pair on. I am always an 11 2E in anything NB and that's what I ordered in these. These give me the squeeze something fierce and I have a pretty good arthritis situation in one foot which makes the one virtually unbearable ergo unwearable. This is on NB for not staying with their consistent sizing and me for not test-driving a pair before I bought them. They were not returnable as the packaging was discarded before they were tried. This again is entirely on me. I might pony up the dollars and buy a pair at 11.5 4E because I really love these shoes and if they fit, I'd be in them all the time. I'll give these ones to a friend or a charity.	2015-08-05

I had to return them for a half size larger.  Any more than that and they would have been flopping off my feet.  After wearing these for a several months, hoping they would stretch out in the toe area a bit, I've had it with them!  I wore them all day yesterday and my big toe on both feet was killing me!  What's up with the stiff rubber surround at the toe that pinches in on the toe area?  Let's have some room up there, New Balance!  New Balance got the second star for style points.

I bought them for their minimal drop (not quite zero but close) for my HIIT training and Squats. I originally sized up from 8 that i tried on in the store to the 8.5 (they didn't have in store) as generally buy in walking shoes  since I buy a 9 in running shoes - well that didn't work so well for the HIIT, Lunges, or boulder hopping because they were way too big. I then bought the 8s and probably could use an 7.5 for my desired purpose since I prefer to wear without socks. I wear my larger ones for running now and my smaller ones for things that I don't want my feet to slide. These are designed to be washed in washing machine and worn without socks if you desire. They are MINIMALIST shoes with good tread. I have super high arches. These do not have arch support at all. I have come to the realization that arch support might be damaging my feet's ability to support themselves well. I was told my feet would probably hurt when I first started since Im not used to minimalist shoes. They did not (I go barefoot a lot). I have narrow heels and wide forefoot. these have a large toebox. I have the Tahoe color and the Pink/orange ones<br />For size reference: I wear a 7.5 in dress shoes, a 8-8.5 in walking shoes, and a 9 in my Brooks running shoes.	2015-08-05

To be absolutely honest I do wear an extra pair of insoles but that is true of any boot I put on my feet. They climb good, offer plenty of ankle support and are waterproof. This is my second pair, and as long as I can get them, they will be my boot of choice for both work and recreation.	2015-08-05

Thank goodness bc these last me a full year. I've bought other Skechers brand styles and none compare. Their newer styles are so soft and just don't seem to stand up to my everyday work. THESE BABIES DO!! Once I get paid again I'll probably buy another pair just in case!	2015-08-05

I really like this shoe but they have fallen apart in a matter of a few months.  The laces originally with this shoes are cheap and wore out within 45 days.

I was very worried the morning I put them on because I was afraid they were going to bother my foot again but I ran my hand inside to smooth over that ridge and it worked. The ridge is still detectable but it no longer bothered my feet and I was able to walk in them for many hours. The width is great and me feet feel very comfortable in them.	2015-08-05

This boots are great, but I'm giving it three stars because within just the first few wears one of the kleats that hold the laces in place broke off.  I'm confident Baffin would repair this for me, but it is the top kleat so I can get by without it and it's just not worth me paying shipping to send them back for something like that.  Otherwise they are great, they fit good, and keep you really warm.  I like how there is an open space above the top of your foot which allows your feet to stay warmer.  You can wear them pretty loose to stay warmer and they'll still stay on your feet pretty well, or you can crank them down pretty good with the laces.  Definitely bulky boots, but they are a pac style boot, so that is absolutely expected.	2015-08-05

I really wanted to like these boots, as they were light weight, had a gore-tex lining and relatively stylish.  The fit and finish were great, EXCEPT for the narrow, really prominent arch.  It was actually quite horrible for my wide feet.  I don't even have that flat an arch, but it felt like a huge slightly soft rock was in my shoe under my arch.  If the arch had been anywhere close to some of the other Merrell's that I have worn, these would have been the perfect lightweight hikers.	2015-08-05

They are an &#34;older&#34; style than my age, but they are so functional and comfortable that I can easily get past that. These shoes are almost half of for what they retail for at the stores so you cannot beat that! I am a wedding planner and coordinator and am on my feet for 12-16 hours a day with non-stop moving. I would not make it without these shoes. They are a little tight when you first get them, but they break in pretty quickly. I have purchased these shoes in the past and so I knew that they ran a little big. I wear a half size smaller in this shoe than I do in other Clarks. These shoes last a long time and are just as comfortable at the end of the day as when you first put them on. I highly recommend this shoe!	2015-08-05

These are really good hiking shoes, but I should have gone a half size bigger.  I typically wear an 8 1/2.  I bought the 8 1/2.  I should've went with a 9.  They feel fine for around town if I keep the laces somewhat loose.  It worries me on long hikes though.  If I could return them I would, but have worn them around quite a bit to give them a fair shot.<br /><br />That being said, Salomon has a great reputation for quality hiking shoes and these are no exception.  They're absolutely well made, but have a fairly narrow footbox for my liking. The tread is solid and gives me good traction where ever I go.  The lace system is simple and works well.  I'd probably love them and give 5 stars if they fit better.	2015-08-05

With concerns for over-pronation, popped kneecaps, & the awful allure of broken hips behind each potentially incapacitating work-a-day overexertion, these boots had better be reliable and maximally comfortable; they are. (Due to these concerns, I tend to buy men's boots; perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems as if they're made better than women's. Can't say if it's so, since I haven't had the money to try women's as well.) Very lightweight, sturdy, well-ventilated & fairly quick-draining, its mid-height securing the ankle, with excellent traction even over oil-slicked pavement (I do hope that was oil...), the Voyageur has non-abrading long-lasting laces with one upper set of gripper lugs to set your desired tension at the ankle. The only negative aspect I've seen is relatively quick lug wear, with a tendency I think most Keens have of some glue-detachment at the sides of the sole. Since I'm rather &#34;thrifty&#34;, my expectations of getting several years of 18 hour wear might be unreasonable.	2015-08-05

My only gripe is like other reviewers said, the in between the toe thing is a little uncomfortable. I thought this wouldn't bother me as i live in flip flops and i am used to the in between the toe thing. I feel its due to the height if the wedge the pressure from the toe thing is uncomfortable. I still love the shoe though and i am happy with my purchase.	2015-08-05

I am usually an 8.5 in peep toed shoes, but ordered a 9 and they are snug but perfect, as the sling is just tight enough.

The size was supposed to be exactly the same ~ 9.5M but somehow the latest pair is wider and much roomier in the arch.  The only reason I ordered a second pair was that the first pair fit so well and are so comfortable I absolutely fell in love with them to use as work shoes.  This new pair is wearable and doesn't give me blisters but I do have to tighten them much more deliberately in the lower eyeloops and since I'm in the EMS field, I'd rather be able to just slip them on quickly and forget about about it.	2015-08-05

These are my 5th pair of Vibrams, first time buying this style. I definitely won't be buying these again.<br /><br />I wore these for less than a month and they've started coming apart at the seams (see photos). I didn't even wear them regularly.<br /><br />The fit is really awkward. They are kind of loose in the toe box and heel, but fit well every else, enough that they aren't uncomfortable.<br /><br />I love my other pairs of Vibrams. I'll chalk this up to just being a problem with this style for now.<br /><br />edit: I'm bumping my rating from 1 star to 2. They have broken in a lot better than I expected (yes I know Vibram's take time to break in, but based on my previous experience with Vibram's and initial fit, I didn't have much hope for these) and are now fairly comfortable, though still big in the toe box. They're still falling apart prematurely, but the rate doesn't seem to be increasing too rapidly.	2015-08-05

Purchased a month before the trip so he had a little time to break them in.  They worked well on the few small hikes we took.  But after hiking the first 2 days of his 14 day trek @ Philmont the glue on the outside edge of one of the boots started to come apart.  SO I only gave the boots a 4 star rating.  They did hold up for the rest of the 77 mile trek and Amazon has agreed to a return, (So thank yo Amazon) He did not have any issues with the boots other than the glue coming off on the outside edge.  The bottom of the treads look great and there were no issues with the stitching. I will buy these again.  He told me the arch support wasn't the best but they were still very comfortable for his trip.	2015-08-05

They are rain boots so they hold to the foot, recommend socks at all times so they don't get blisters when it rubs. My kids LOVE, and I mean LOVE these boots.

They are almost as comfortable as the ones I used to have with a couple of differences:  1.  The toe area of the footbed is MUCH wider (at least an inch) even though the rest of the footbed seems similar to my old pair.  2.  The triangle &#34;link&#34; near the pinky toes do not have a piece of material underneath like my old ones. So far, this hasn't been an issue with blisters or anything, but my toes are just more &#34;aware&#34; of that link being there.  These are definitely more comfortable than the Barracuda style I bought off of Zulilly last year (knowing that my old ones were bound to go sooner or later)<br /><br />These have great traction and great pattern!  I actually bought 2 pairs in different patterns - one to keep at home and one for my summer place.	2015-08-05

The Kayano's are a very dependable brand and provide great comfort, while still being somewhat lightweight. The one drawback of wearing these shoes is that it isn't very sleek or stylish. Personally I don't mind, but sneaker buffs will not look kindly upon you. I love these shoes, and I would recommend them to anyone who walks a lot during the day, as these are great for walking.	2015-08-05

I don't normally write reviews, but under the circumstances, I feel compelled and hope this helps someone else.  I appreciate the information from other people found in reviews, and I always look at them before ordering online.<br /><br />I have worn these sandals for about 10 years, and do swear by them.  I wear an 8.5.  In any other shoe I have to order Wide Width.  My situation is very bad feet; wide, with bunions, bunionettes (the bulge on the side of the little toe), high, arthritic and painful insteps.  I have had surgery to repair one foot, requiring a lengthy process to get back to normal activity.  I have several screws and a steel plate in that foot, both in the big toe and the top of the mid-foot.  Needless to say, my shoes are important and it's very difficult to find ones that I can wear.<br /><br />This shoe gives a good amount of support, is wide enough for my foot, and has a high round toe box.  And, you can wear it in the water, to protect your feet.  It can go in the washing machine to clean.  We do cycling vacations, and I love these shoes to ride my bike.  They have the protection for your toes, but are much cooler than wearing sneakers.  I have walked all over Europe in these shoes.  I own several colors.  And they last and wear well.  I definitely recommend them.  The other Keen styles do not work for me, but I wish they did.<br /><br />If anyone reads this and knows of some dressier flat shoes with a wide width and a high toe box I would love to hear about it.	2015-08-05

Unfortunately, they arrived with a thin slice in the leather on the top of the right shoe. I didn't notice this until I wore them the first time, so I could not return them. My advice. Closely inspect the shoe before wearing.  Also after wearing the shoes for a month or so, the strap broke. I thought this was a fluke, so I purchased another pair, this time through a local brick and mortar - within a few months, the strap broke. I'm not hard on shoes and can usually wear a pair for several seasons. I've never had a problem with LifeStride before, but there's something wrong with the construction of this particular shoe.	2015-08-05

I bought these as another brand that I have are wearing out and I can not find if anyone carries them anywhere as I do not remember the old brand's name.  These are comfortable and from the top look like my old shoes.  The difference in this shoe is all the bands have a unstrechable layer underneath except for the heel strap.  This makes them a bit less gripping on my foot.  I prefer the straps that are totally elastic as it gives better grip on my upper foot without any restriction.  The also have a continued sole instead of a elevated heel.  This makes them appear a bit less dressy. But I do not want super high heels either.  These do have a better arch support but I was not looking for that. If I had never had my first pair of &#34;Gladiator&#34; shoes I would probably be 100% happy with these.  Now I would say I am 95% happy just because I was spoiled with my &#34;perfect&#34; shoes.	2015-08-05

I've worn Skechers in the past, as they typically fit my wide foot well without having to buy a &#34;wide&#34; width. I don't typically wear sneakers, and usually prefer boots, but I found myself in a Skechers outlet on a hot day. These seem to not come in half sizes, so I went a half size smaller, and they are the perfect fit without socks. These are also the only shoes I've ever had that are comfortable without socks. After wearing them for a few months, I bought two more pairs from Amazon. It seems like they are either sporadically available, or being discontinued (which I hope isn't the case).	2015-08-05

I bought these primarily for summer hiking, not trail running. I wanted a lighter, more ventilated shoe. These definitely fit the bill, and the color really pops! I first wore them one day to see how they felt, then went on a 9 miles hike with my Sunday group. No added insoles, although I had been using a memory foam insole in my Vasque hiking shoes. They felt great, even the long downhill at the end of the hike didn't mash my toes!<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about ordering the correct size. I wear a 8.5 in regular sneakers, and a 9 in hiking boots. According to the Salomon size chart (on their website) I should get 8.5, so I did, even though many reviewers said they ran large. At first my left big toe felt too close to the front edge, but if I make certain my heel is set firmly against the back before tightening the laces, they fit just fine. They are comfortably snug from heel to mid-foot, then they open up to a roomy toe box.<br /><br />The Quick-Lace system works OK, and there will be no more untied laces when hiking through underbrush!<br /><br />Although I am happy with Vasque boots, I will definitely consider purchasing Salomon boots in the future!	2015-08-05

These are high quality, super comfortable flip flops, they are &#34;true to size&#34;, and fit exactly as I expected.  I wore my flip flops around the house for short periods of time for about a week but unlike many reviews I had read it wasn't necessary for me to stretch my flip flops.  This is my first pair of Rainbow Sandals so prior to making my purchase I went to the local mall and tried on all the styles available.  Based on looks alone this was the style I preferred and I am glad I went to the mall and tried on all the styles available because none of the other styles were comfortable enough for me nor did they live up to what I was looking for as far as size and fit goes.  Initially, I had my doubts as to whether or not these sandals were really worth the price.  I am glad to report that these sandals are definitely worth every penny.  I absolutely love my Rainbow Sandals!	2015-08-05

The love the pattern which looks lovely n the quality is good for the price. This is a very BEAUTIFUL and GORGEOUS piece.The bag is a good size measuring 12.99in W X 10.23in H X 5.51in D same as in displayed in amazon.Snake pattern decorate top dual handles thought kind of stands out i would have liked it black too or a chain  but then that would have been the expected  design.<br />The design and the color can be perfectly paired with any outfit. Its well made and the stitching is good and its a prices very well.I will use the bag when i need to put in a lot of stuff as there's  a lot of organization space as well. You have one main zip compartment which has a large thin center zip compartment, another small zip compartment and 2 pouches within it. On the outside of the bag there is another zip compartment on the back as well.I can put a lot of stuff inside.....The Zipper is of good quality as i  felt it was smooth and no issues with the zippers jamming, breaking or tarnishing as of yet.The fabric lining isn't that cheap lining.The Bag looks great and very spacious as in the video , good quality for the price and every girl/women must have this set to go with any style but according to my opinion it will look best with denim wear or winter coats.This being said please remember is a synthetic leather and not Leather. I'd recommend this to friends and family .Its a good quality bag that is very  functional.I received this product for free for evaluation and provide for an honest review.I received the bag in two days..amazing shipping.	2015-08-05

If you order your &#34;normal&#34; shoe size, I'd suggest investing in some thick work socks. If not, the composite toe will be unbearable as they will cut into your big toe and pinky toe bones. Thick socks also help fill the boot up (the space between the top of your foot and the boot itself) which makes the overall &#34;fit&#34; better. The boots are EXTREMELY well built and I'm sure they will last a long time. The best part about them are the souls. Very comfortable (when the composite parts aren't digging in to you).	2015-08-05

These sandals looked comfortable and easy to adjust. I purchased these sandals because the brand name usually has such quality products. The leather straps that cross the top of the foot attach with Velcro strips. The leather straps were not very substantial like I usually like. I noticed right off the back that the sandals were measuring almost a half size larger than what I ordered. The sandals are attractive and comfortable. They have a very nice rubber sole for walking. One note, when the straps came across the foot and attach to the other side, if you have to tighten them for any reason, the straps do not line up quite right and they kind of adhere at a slanted angle to each other. The leather straps are stiff and not pliable. They also have a leather insole so these would not be sandals you would want to sweat in or wear to the beach. They are easily adjustable with the top straps and the adjustable heel strap. For the money, I think they are a little overpriced. A good casual sandal.	2015-08-05

I say these fit &#34;as expected&#34; because I EXPECT the toe area to be a bit too wide. (I got a N.)  My feet are so narrow it is virtually impossible to get ones that really fit across the toe unless they have straps with buckles.  However, these are not so wide as to be a problem, and they look GREAT.  I was concerned they wouldn't be comfortable for wearing for long stretches because they are pretty thin, but no, I can go all day!  (I don't need much arch support.  If you do, these won't work.)  Very glad I got them!  I've loved the Bass Margie style, though the knock-off Amazon carries tends to have straps break after only a season or two; I'm hoping this version won't have a similar issue.	2015-08-05

The shoes were very comfortable when wearing them around the store and broke in quickly, that is why I gave them 2 stars.  I broke them in by walking in them for 20 miles or so.  I set out tfor a week long backpacking hiking trip with my new shoes.  I was disappointed from the start.  The ankle support on the trail is practically non existent.  The worst part of all is there is NO TRACTION what-so-ever!  I slipped on leaves, small rocks, ladge, leaves, and pretty much whatever I walked on besides blacktop.  When things were wet it made everything a million times worse!  It took me much longer because I had to be overly cautious walking so I wouldn't fall.  Even being extra careful I still fell 4 times.  I would never buy these shoes again, and if I would return them after putting 110 miles on them I would do it tomorrow!  Traction and lack of ankle support are huge problems with this boot.  Comfort and easy breaking in are the pros.	2015-08-05

He likes the fit and look of the shoe and it fits in with the dressy-casual expectation of his office.  I expected the Cole Haan product quality would be better than other, lesser priced, retail shoes that are available, which would justify the cost.  This has not been the case, however, and it took two pair to teach us this lesson.<br /><br />The problem is that the sole has worn through on both pair quite quickly, much faster than any other shoes that he owns, and he owns a lot of shoes.  If you look up on Cole Haan's website, they do offer a repair service, but it costs almost as much, or as much, as a new pair of shoes.  Tack on shipping and you'll be paying more.<br /><br />I am highly disappointed in these shoes and will not be purchasing any more shoes from Cole Haan.	2015-08-05

I bought them at my street shoe size. I have somewhat wide feet, and these shoes fit great both length and width wise. Their shape is slightly asymmetric in the toe area, I can sometimes feel my toes are squeezed and hurt slightly if I wear them more than an hour. However, the rubber on the heel section of the upper sole of these shoes are shaped aggressively, and cut in to your ankle at first. After some break in, it becomes better. And I found that you should not over-tighten the laces, this also helps to prevent discomfort in the heel area. Among other shoes that I have tried on, I find La Sportiva Solutions feel most comfortable for my feet, at 1.5 size smaller than my street shoes size. This also gives you an idea of how the sizes of these two model compare.<br /><br />I am only a beginner, but performance-wise I don't have any complaints about these shoes in my three months of climbing in local gym. They stay on small foot holds really well, and are sufficient for heel hooks and toe hooks. I can also smear securely on the wall in the gym, but only with a lot of pressure (I admit that I still need lots of foot work practice). Note that the sole of the shoes is almost flat with no or very little downturn. The material is also relatively soft, so that you can feel the holds and practice your foot muscle. I think although these shoes are not specifically designed for beginners, but it definitely works for my need as a beginner.	2015-08-05

I wore these to a wedding over the weekend and because they're suede they attracted dirt (outdoor wedding) and the back of one of the shoes is already coming loose so it's causing my heel to pop when I walk in them. I had hoped to be able to wear these a little more often for work and another wedding coming up, but I really don't think they'll last that long. For the price and for the style I was looking for, it still worked out.	2015-08-05

I own 4 pair (3 different styles) now and these I didn't like so much.  When you walk they slap the heal of your foot, and it is really LOUD.  I did not like them as much as I thought I would.  I expected to like the thicker straps, which I usually were.  It seems like the yoga mat bottom is different then the others that I have.  Don't think I would recommend this one itself, but I will rave about the other 3 pair that I have, actually I will be buying more Sanuk sandals really soon.	2015-08-05

I bought them in brown and was so impressed after the first time I wore them that I immediately ordered them in black.  The shoe has really good arch support and the inner sole molds to your foot after a couple of wearings.  It is very flexible and extraordinarily comfortable.  The inner lining is suede-like and the the outer sole has a hiker-like gripping rubber.  There are 3 Velcro straps for adjustment across the ankle and heel, so you can get the fit and comfort just how you like it.  I like the shoe too because even though it is not dressy, it is not clunky or chunky either and can be worn with all but the dressiest things.  They run exactly true to size.  Excellent value even at full price--better yet at the 40% off I paid.	2015-08-05

The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for and it's pretty functional (wear it wet or dry). The only thing is the straps tend to bunch at the ankle. It's not a big deal since it's not uncomfortable, it just looks strange. Overall, I would recommend this shoe...my feet thank me for it!	2015-08-05

Love these shoes just like most of Naot leather sandals and have wore them for many years. This will be about my 6th pair. They have a lot of support, unlike flip-flops, and have soft leather components. They start to shape to you foot shape after 1st wear and are comfortable for all day walking. My size is 38 Euro and 7.5 American, avg foot width and normal arch. I get compliments on the cheetah print which is really kind of neutral and goes get with my usual outfits of jeans and black or white tee shirts.	2015-08-05

Needed something to quickly slide in and out of. I have a small normal/skinny width foot and they barely fit. Based on the measurement chart on Amazon I determined to by size 6 and my toes and heels come to the front and back of shoe, with very little to spare. If you have a wide foot this sandal will not fit!! They are rubber, so they rub across the top of the foot if warn for too long. They work for my purpose, but wouldn't wear them all the time.	2015-08-05

When the case first arrived, it looked great. The size fit my Oakley Holbrook glasses and it seemed sturdy enough. I leave my case in my car and keep my glasses in it when I'm not wearing them. Simple enough. Sadly, the case did not last more than a few months and the heat from being left in my car completely destroyed my case. The glue that held the case cover on separated and the inside lining of the case separated. There were times when the glue literally was oozing down the side of the case. I live where it can get 95 degrees outside so it's hot, but you would expect a sunglass case to be able to withstand the heat. Do not buy this case if you plan on keeping it in your car. Total waste of money. I contacted the seller (Temecula Motorsports) and they said there is nothing they can do since it's past the 30 day return policy. I figured since they sold a piece of junk that they might return it or give a refund. Nope. Stay clear of this case.	2015-08-05

These are rain boots I purchased for my toddler - he loves jumping in the puddles.  The price point was good and the camouflage look was perfect to match his raincoat.<br />He likes them and wears them whenever he gets a chance.  They look way cool with the clear plastic and the camo print.  I try not to let him wear them too long because there isn't any support or cushioning in the boot- but they are rain boots- we didn't expect that from these.<br /><br />The inside liners come out easily when he pulls his foot out.  We have washed them and they survived the washer and dryer with no shrinking (I was shocked!)<br />We have had these for a few weeks now and the plastic smell still lingers in our closet.  I read that in the reviews when we purchased them and didn't realize how strong it would be.  If you are sensitive to smells, avoid these.  I moved them from my son's room to the downstairs garage closet so we wouldn't smell the plastic everyday.<br /><br />These were a great price and we would buy them again- for just a rain boot to jump in puddles.  That was our intention when we purchased them and we are not disappointed.  Would have received 5 stars if it weren't for the smell.	2015-08-05

I bought a similar style of DC men's a long time ago and loved them. Found a conversion chart that said that a Women's 9/Men's 7 was the same as a Big Kids 7. My originals finally died after LOTS of wear so I started looking for some replacements. Found the same style in adult sizes, but I really liked the color of these. They are a TOUCH shorter than the adult versions and the strap is a bit more slim width than the men's, but they are just as comfortable. The blue is a couple of shades darker than the image, but it's still a really nice bright blue. Highly recommend this style of DC flip flops in both adult and kids.	2015-08-05

With today's technology you can take care of your puppies and still look stylish.<br /><br />My manager has heel spurs and a swollen foot after working years in retail. I've suggested giving The Walking Company or even Dansko's shoe and boot line a shot to replace her fashionable but unsupported sandals and heels with equally fashionable comfy support. She wasn't buying it and I was met with a scoff and an proclamation that those shoes were for &#34;old people.&#34;<br /><br />Not wanting my own feet to end up like my manager's I decided, well..I can't really speak for the shoes unless I've tried them myself. After reading reviews of the Lulu and many happy wearers claiming they can walk hours/miles in the city with them on without feeling like they're killing themselves by the end of it I was sold. I got these babies in red which happen to look like pink out of the box and up close. No big deal. I prefer pink over red anyway!<br /><br />I'm usually a boot person because wearing flats makes me feel like there's a thin layer of leather between my feet and the concrete but since owning these Lulus for two days they've replaced my boots quickly and I can say they live up to the hype, price, and claims. I can see myself wearing these indefinitely and I've never heard of or had a mary jane that can provide this much support. I will have to try these out in the city as well.<br /><br />These cuties can easily be dressed up or down. I wear them with skinny jeans and leggings and the strap is easily hidden. They look like pumps from the front and can be worn with tights or crop pants and shorts for a more feminine look. I can't wait to wear these with a dress. This experience has made me want to check out their boot line as well. My manager's definitely missing out.	2015-08-05

Unfortunately, the price is not in my range at the moment! So I started buying cheap $15 - $20 poorly made purses that did not even look that great to ride me over until my budget would allow me my designer purse. I found this MyLux purse after months of frustration and replacements of those other purses, which kept falling apart within a week or too. The MyLux looked designer-esque to me. The color/material looked gorgeous to me and the biggest selling point was the amount of room inside and the stable bottom equipped with pegs so that the purse never needed to touch the surface it was on. This product looked and worked EXACTLY how I wanted! As usual, Amazon delivered it quickly and in perfect condition. I was even impressed with the metal embellishment hanging off the front which has now become my official key holder. I never have to search through my purse looking for my keys again!! I would recommend this purse to anyone wanting a quality, durable, spacious purse that will not only last but looks great too!	2015-08-05

A very stylish boot for someone who wants more than the classic Ugg boots. Pair it with a blazer, a white shirt, and light jeans and you're good to go! I don't recommend it for someone who wants to wear it in the rain or snow. The boots are a bit tight at first but it stretches out after a couple of uses.<br /><br />You should spend your money on this is you really want the &#34;Ugg&#34; brand and don't want something that is common (Bailey bows, buttons, classic).	2015-08-05

Not really somewhat small, just made poorly. When strapped up, the right shoe wants to point outward at an angle, pinching the insole.

Wearing these cleared up a problem of my ankle rolling when I went on my daily run.  Now when I run I'm able to go farther and faster due to my ankle no longer rolling on a regular basis.  After a few months of daily wear, I noticed my lower calves and ankles were much stronger; the difference was night and day.<br /><br />When ordering, order the exact size that your foot is -- KSO EVOs fit sort of like a sock.  Put the shoes on toes first, then heel, otherwise the KSO EVOs will stretch out and you'll feel like you're wearing a flipper.	2015-08-05

They would have been slipping off my feet. I only wore them in the house for a couple of hours and found them not only to be too wide and too long but heavy as well. If they ever go on sale again and I can catch them in 9.5 I might take a chance on them again, but overall I think for a shoe of this type and price range, it might be better to try before you buy in a brick and mortar store, then order the size that fits best online.	2015-08-05

They are among the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  I have a very wide foot and usually have to order a double wide, but with the Softwalk a wide width is perfect.  These look good with skirts and slacks and I can wear them for hours.  I only had to downgrade them on the arch support.  I have a high arch and there is no support there.  Still, Softwalk is among my favorite brands and I will probably be ordering in another color.	2015-08-05

Love the look of this shoe and the options to dress it up or down. I've been wearing Danskos for over 20 years and think they're the best most versatile shoe around.

I first bought a pair of these while on the road - from a quaint giftshop. I thought they were BRILLIANT! Small, SUPER comfy, fit in a small travel bag - perfect as hotel slippers! So I ordered another pair here at Amazon.com. Yes, they are just as comfy and look great, but I was irked that they came in a travel pouch that had a 4-inch long slash - as if some dufuss with a box cutter had done a sloppy job opening a crate of them. I sent the vendor a letter, but they deflected the blame to Amazon.com. HEY whomever, be careful, willya? Now I have travel slippers that fold, but the case they are to be stored in has a slash across it, and will likely tear WIDE open after a couple uses. NOT HAPPY. I will just have to go buy a cosmetic case that I can stuff these into for travel. Cuz it is amazing that they fold in half, yet unfold and are completely comfortable (not flimsy or with any detectable &#34;fold&#34; feel to them). Would LOVE to order more when the colors and sizes are replenished. HOWEVER, do order a size up if you are at the high end of the scale. A 7-8 is NOT big enough for someone who needs an 8.	2015-08-05

I walked and played in them all day and no pinching on the toes, no blisters on the heels, and no slipping on rocks.  I generally wear a size 7.5 and due to reviews of a tight fit, I bought the size 8, the shoes fit loose but were not too big, just a little loose.  Even when walking in water they did not slip off and gripped the rocks.  Only problem, small rocks will get stuck in the tread on the bottom, but only once did I need to stop to get the rock out.  I bent the super supple sole and the rock popped out.  I would definitely get another pair and would buy them for friends and relatives.  Happy trails!	2015-08-05

Until these gorgeous Dansko sandals arrived, I wore my Chaco sandals with everything-shorts, dresses, jeans, you name it. Now there is nothing wrong with this, except that they aren't dressy. These Dansko sandals are comfortable and absolutely beautiful. They pair perfectly with a pair of jeans, a skirt or dress. They give a dressy touch to any outfit without being over the top. I am very impressed with how comfortable these are. Like every pair of Dansko's I own (which is quite a few) the arch support is fantastic. These are a beautiful vibrant red which makes them a great accessory. The strap around the ankle is adjustable. The straps across the top of the foot are not, however given that they are leather, they will stretch and break in after wearing them a few times. I give them 5 stars for comfort and 5 stars for looks.	2015-08-05

I live in the Midwest and we get lots of rain in the spring, I have not had a pair of these shoes leak yet and I golf 4 or 5 days a week. I don't even change at the course anymore I wear them from the time I leave the house to play golf to the time I get back home.

I used to own a pair of Bellevilles but they didn't have the ankle support. But this Blackhawk pair is really nice. It's fits snug to my feet and the insoles are pretty comfortable so don't feel much of an impact when you run especially on hardtop. The only down side with this pair is that there is no ventilation although it's meant for hot weather environment. So if you are out in the field a lot or doing a lot of waking then be prepare for your socks to get somewhat wet. But it's not an issue if it's for garrison wear. Overall it's a great pair.	2015-08-05

I have been buying Magnum boots for at least 15 years, mostly stealth force style and this was the first pair I tried that I didn't like. The top back of the boot where the padding and v shape is rubs on my calves and causes irritation. Also the boots seemed smaller in width and length than I am used to when getting a new pair. Since I have narrow feet I was surprised how squished my feet felt inside the boots. They felt so uncomfortable I sent them back for a refund. I bought them on sale for less than half price so I really didn't want to return them, but I knew it was the correct choice. I just bought another pair of Magnums that resemble my old pair of Magnum Stealth boots, they are called Magnum Men's Response III 8.0 . They should come in the mail tomorrow so hopefully I like those better, either way I will leave a review for those boots too in the near future.	2015-08-05

Update 7/18/2017 Sad day today ! The strap finally broke because my foot got stuck and I just kept pulling instead of taking my foot out of my flip flip and unsticking the flip flop from the floor ...  oh well .. 5 years is not too bad, huh?   I bought a couple of Roxy flip flops (these and the Low Tide ones) but these are definitely my favorite. I find myself wearing them all the time. I shower with them every day ( I am sharing a shower with my roommate and prefer not to walk barefoot) and they have been holding up pretty well for 2.5 yrs now (pictures are from today).  The Low Tide ones have a cloth strap which makes them soft and cushioned but i feel they are a bit heavy for 24/7 use. These are very light, the strap is made of rubber which means they dry faster too.  I am a size 6.5 and size 7 fits perfectly. My flip flops usually die after a few months of everyday shower use. Even if they don't fall apart, they usually get worn down on one side and my foot keeps slipping to the side which is super annoying so I end up throwing them away. I am a very bad walker so I tend to ruin all of my shoes by wearing them down on one side. But not these flip flops! In these flipflops my foot stays centered and they wear down only slightly in the middle (most likely just being pressed by the weight). I would buy these over and over again! (if they ever fall apart that is, even though there is no indication of that yet :))	2015-08-05

While living there before my retirement, I would go to the neighborhood shoe store, which has always been very busy.  I was told by the shoe people who work there that I would need a size bigger than my regular shoes, a size 7M, which I never had a problem with.  Since living in Missouri, I bought these shoes from Amazon. com.  I noticed they are a bit bigger in the back and on the sides.  Are they now making these shoes bigger than a few years back?  Please answer my question; I want to know what to do about the shoes.  Thank you.<br />I use the Keen shoes for water exercise only.  I've tried a size 6 1/2.  They fit well, but my feet in front are a bite cramped in.<br /><br />Chris H.	2015-08-05

The initial break in period is a bit of a pain but just go slow and wear them for a few hours each day and within a week or two you should be able to wear them around the clock. My major complaint about these shoes is that bottom soles on my first pair wore down to the cork within 6 months and now I need to look at getting them fixed. They should last way longer than than but in defense of the shoe, I did wear them every single day for those 6 months. I now have a second pair so I don't have to be without while I repair the first.<br /><br />I did buy both pairs at a local store however. I attempted online ordering of these and they arrived clearly worn. It isn't hard to tell with Birks - after about a day you'll see an imprint of the foot on the footbed. So be careful when buying online and be prepared to send them back because you may end up with a pair that was a previous return.<br /><br />As for sizing, you'll likely end up wearing a size slightly smaller than what you are used to. I wear a 38 in Birks which is a woman's 7 (I normally wear an 8 in most shoes). My husband wears a 42/men's 9 when he is typically a 10.5. Keep that in mind when ordering,	2015-08-05

And now since this particular color seems to be discontinued, we will have to look for another shoe.	2015-08-05

The original Go Walk shoes were awesome for this--NEVER a blister, even after first try and FIRST walk in them. That was unprecedented. So I decided to try THIS pair that had a thicker sole, and in the same size. I should have sized down a half-size--they were slightly large and this caused, yep!, a HUGE blister on the back of my heel, rendering them useless until it heals and I have a nice thick scar where it was rubbing...	2015-08-05

In fact I love most of my Crocs and live in them all spring and summer.  I got these in fuschia and the color is great.  I don't generally care for thong sandals but thought these would be fun to wear during the day and even for casual dinners on our upcoming cruise.  Now, I'm not sure I will even bring them along.  As other reviewers wrote, I too had some minor discomfort with the rear piece poking and rubbing my ankle.  It also does not sit on the middle of the back of the ankle and feels like it turns in towards the inside just off center and enough to feel weird.  Adjusting the strap does not seem to help with this problem.  If it doesn't rub at the ankle then it pulls on the inside of my toe from the thong.  Now, if I'm lucky and hit it just right, with my heel pulled slightly back to rest in the cradled portion of the rounded heel and my toe just right around the thong, I can actually go a few strides without incident.  But of course, they don't stay like that as you move and so after a few steps I am in pain and trying to grip and readjust my stride which is too much work to make a shoe feel comfortable.  It either is or it isn't.  I wear a 7.5 in regular shoes but have always been fine with a 7 Croc.  These seemed a hair large with the front just a tad longer than I'd like for a sandal so maybe the whole thing was just off to begin with.  I wore for about 3 days in a row to give it a fair chance and to break in as other suggested but it just isn't working for me.  I may continue to wear casually for very short periods but these will not be my go to Crocs.  Had no problems with the rivets so far and have been very careful to secure those areas when putting on and taking off.  Only time will tell.  Update- so I really couldn't believe I'd met a pair of crocs I didn't like.  Well, actually I'm sorry but I can't stand the original clog crocs!  All the sleek flats and my one winter pair with liner- love love love.  So I really couldn't believe how badly these were for me and I gave them another chance.  Wore them another couple of days and I am coming around.  I guess I've built up a callous on the back of my ankles and they no longer rub.  Every now and then the thong piece pulls the wrong way but for the most part these are now working for me.  Maybe they will go on vacation with me after all.  But I will be careful and wear a more tried and true pair on port days with lots of walking.  These will be great for sea days when I can run back to the cabin and change if needed.  Love the color!	2015-08-05

There is a good amount of cushion, but it is not that dense. All that being said, I would buy these again if I find them on sale, but I would not wear them on a day when I know I'll be on my feet a lot.	2015-08-05

This is a great entry level Turf shoes made by Nike. It is lower priced than most Turf shoes out there in the market but that does not mean that it is bad. With the lower price you are going to have to make some slight sacrifices however. The upper is a bit thicker than the the higher end ones of the hypervenom line is probably the most noticeable difference. The shoes are extremely light, with a great textured pattern on the upper. Overall the design is great and does provide pops of color that other can marvel at. It is durable and will satisfy your casual indoor soccer needs.	2015-08-05

Having already carried a Lauren Ralph Lauren (&#34;Sloan St.&#34; satchel) everyday for 2 1/2 years that looks as fabulous today as the day it arrived, I didn't hesitate in purchasing this item.  My bags tend to get packed full but the structure never suffered.  I was shopping for a new one in a different color & considered Dooney, Coach and Kors.  My older Dooney weighs 5 pounds empty so I was really hesitant, but reading reviews on Macy's, Amazon & the official websites I found its not uncommon for these 3 brands to have issues with seams, leather shredding, color peeling etc. and that made my decision for me. I prefer to be safe and not sorry so I went with another Lauren bag. I bought this one in red, can definitely see it's going to be equally stunning in every situation- business appt., lunch with friends, dinner with my love or antiquing with my sisters , no matter if you are dressed up or down this one will work.  Love that about this line.  I also don't want the hassle of having to change bags to compliment my dress.  I'm petite &'this size is perfect, I don't look like I'm playing dress up in my mommys clothes or that the bag is wearing me. The magnetic clasp is substantial and located inside the leather so you never have to worry about losing any part of it.  It really keeps that section secure.  It takes some effort to open the clasp so the contents won't come spilling out when your bag hits the floor upside down.  If you're tired of wasting money on cheap bags or feel like you've been ripped off by higher end bags go with Lauren.  I think you'll be a fan or even a collector for life too.	2015-08-05

Before buying these amazing shoes I began to notice that after my runs, my ankles and arches would become painfully sore. This is everything you want in a shoe. It is super lightweight, provides incredible arch support, utilizes a fabulous &#34;quick lace&#34; technology and is breathable. How breathable you ask? Just this morning I caught a breeze and enjoyed the feeling of cool air between my toes. Yeah. These shoes are THAT GOOD. If you're looking for a supportive running shoe that practically cradles your feet, look no further.	2015-08-05

I bought a pair of these exact boots 7 years ago and I finally decided to replace the old pair. These boots are AMAZING! They fit perfectly and they are so comfortable. I work in landscaping and I need a reliable pair of work boots that can last me all day! I've had this pair for over 2 months now and they have been wonderful. Unfortunately the toe of the boots have become extremely scuffed up over the past week and are beginning to show a lot of wear and tear. I am extremely happy with this purchase I just advise potential customers that they can begin to wear down quickly if they are not properly maintained. Regardless when the time comes I will gladly purchase another new pair of these boots.	2015-08-05

I bought these sandals in black size 6.5 but, you definitely have to size down a whole size for this style.. The down side about these sandals is that the ankle straps are very short... Like a previous reviewer said, &#34;You have to really maneuver to get these sandals on&#34;... The straps across the toes & the middle straps are very comfortable... I will be keeping these sandals because I think the ankle straps will loosen up with wear and I also like the feminine/sexy look to it...	2015-08-05

In fact, I have them all displayed in a room in my house hanging on the wall. So when I was offered this Leather Clutch from Aonal for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one to add to my collection. It arrived and I am beyond impressed!! The color is phenomenal, the size is perfect, and the multiple straps makes this Purse very versatile. It is definitely made with quality material and the leather is super soft. There are 3 zippers; the main zipper, one on the inside and one on the outside. It is big enough to fit a large wallet, sunglasses, cell phone and a few more things. I definitely recommend this purse to anyone who wants a great versatile bag.	2015-08-05

I love the second pair just as much. The reason for the 1 star rating: just yesterday as I walked across the room, wearing my origin pair of Kiraku Tomaki thongs that are only two months old, the part that fits between the toes &#34;blew out&#34;, of the left thong. I can't wear them anymore. $50 thongs that lasted two months. I'm hoping that I can contact the seller and ask if they'll replace the thongs. I also hope the experience isn't repeated with the second pair.<br />What makes them great is the footbed with the nice ridge for your toes. You don't feel like you're having to work at keeping the thong on your feet. They're nice and secure. Very good quality rubber(ish) footbed and some. Very comfortable and supportive. At least until they fall apart. :(	2015-08-05

These sandals are not as comfortable out of the box as the Uma style, but the footbed is fairly comfortable. I use these for everyday wear (I can't stand to go barefoot, even around the house). The front strap is adjustable, but I didn't need to move it at all. The strap across the arch has an elastic piece that helps it to stretch across the top of the foot. I have a high instep / high arches, and this strap was a little tight out of the box, so I have to break them in. I still don't like these as much as the Uma style (I'm so sad they are no longer available), and even though this sandal has the same sole/footbed, the arch support doesn't seem quite as high. As with all Naot shoes/sandals, these are very well made with high quality materials. I'm sure I'll get many years of wear from them, as I have with my other Naot products.	2015-08-05

The last few months I've been having some foot problems and it's been a daily ritual to get exactly the right amount of cushioning on the bottoms of my feet to 1) be able to stand for a long amount of time without it feeling like I'm on broken glass, and 2) Keep my feet as 'stress-free' as I possibly can to help them heal. I'd been doing okay but it seemed like it's been two steps forward, one and a half steps back.<br />Today I received these shoes, and... I WAS PAIN-FREE THE ENTIRE DAY! Yes, they are 'men's' shoes, but they fit right and are sturdy and secure, with good arch support and cushioning, and they don't look 'weird.' (Those of you shopping for shoes for assorted foot problems know exactly what I mean.)<br />I just ordered another pair, and will order another after that. They will be the only shoes I wear from now on, and the sneakers I'd &#34;PaidLess&#34; for, which despite their name were definitely not my Champions, are in the trash.	2015-08-05

I've worn them several times.<br /><br />I think they're pretty cute. I have them in black and like to wear them with colorful knee socks and a dress. The knee socks show above the tops of the boots, creating a fun look.<br /><br />The white circular rings at the top of the boots are intended to help you pull the boots on. You'll also see spaces for the Jibbitz of your choice, should you desire to purchase those separately.<br /><br />The boots are lightweight and easy to clean--simply wipe off any dirt. They feel durable, and so far, I have not had any major issues with them. Though, I think I should have purchased the next size up. I wear a 9.5 and bought a 9. They fit, but I can't help but wonder if I would have been happier with a 10.<br /><br />The main disadvantage is the material. It provides comfort, but it makes my feet hot and  sweaty. The boots also are stiff.  I haven't had any problems walking on flat surfaces, but stairs can be a problem. The boots just do not flex with your ankles.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are good boots for a rainy day. I just hope you don't have to walk very far.	2015-08-05

I typically wear a women's size 6.5 - 7, and Crocs in Wm 7 usually fit fine.  These flip flops in a 7 are almost on the short side for me, but they may stretch a bit as I wear them. Otherwise, they are very lightweight and are comfy.  I will likely by them in other colors, possibly in a larger size.  UPDATE:  After a few weeks of light wear inside the house, the ends have begun to curl up at the toe and the shoe has flattened out in the center (under ball of foot) making them much less comfortable than originally stated.  This is disappointing as I normally love Crocs.  Will look for a different pair.	2015-08-05

They look nice. I bought the coffee brown pair and they just look good.<br />2. These are comfortable. There is some cushioning although I don't expect it to last for years and years of use. They fit my feet very well and don't fall off.<br />3. The bottoms are rubber soles which adds a non stick element. I also feel comfortable wearing these outside because they do have a &#34;sort of feel like shoes&#34; feel to them.<br />4. The inside is fuzzy which makes these comfortable to wear with socks or with shoes.<br />5. Good for squashing bugs on the wall =P<br />6. They seem well made. I didn't have any loose threads and the stitching feels secure and we'll done.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. None yet but I'll likely update my review if things go wrong.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have noted, these do squeeze your feet a little bit so they're probably not for people who need wide slippers. They also provide little arch support but I knew this buying them. They're slippers, not running shoes =)<br /><br />Overall, I love these things and I finally feel like I have a comfortable pair of slippers that's going to last me a while. I've been wearing them since they got here and I've not problems with them whatsoever. Good price too!	2015-08-05

The problem, too, it that there aren't really heavy weight no-show socks. I usually wear the lowest cut Puma socks I can find, and those still show a good bit, the way these dip down. For reference, I usually wear size 10 in tennis shoes, 9-9.5 in sandals, and I just bought Clark Halle boots that fit comfortably as a 9.5.<br /><br />*Update - they are still a bit loose, but workable, with an insert inside.	2015-08-05

These shoes are great for a narrow foot! I couldn't get the narrow size, so I bought the regular medium width and the fit is perfect -- so I would say they run a little narrow, but run true to size in length. The interior is soft and really, really comfortable. The red leather is a perfect red to wear with jeans, or with clothes with navy in them. The shoes have what I consider a dainty (for lack of a better word) silouhette, in a good way, so they look good with skirts. With the straps and open areas, they are cool enough to wear in the summer; I wear them without socks or tights. I expect to be able to wear them with skinny jeans in spring and fall, too.<br /><br />Not to get too excited about a pair of comfort shoes, but I was actually thrilled that these red flats worked for me after having to return the adorable Clarks Fara Paige shoes!	2015-08-05

After a couple of hundred miles, they were still holding strong even though they didn't quite grip like they used to.<br /><br />Based on my previous experience, I picked up these boots.  Sadly, that was a mistake for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First the good.<br /><br />The Grip - The grip on these boots is second to none.  These boots even provide a decent amount of grip on wet rock.  I haven't found anything that beats Roclite when it comes to grip.<br /><br />Lightweight - The boots are about the size of a normal pair of boots, but they weight about 1/2 as much.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Size - These are boots are insanely small.  Normally I buy my normal size and have plenty of room to spare.  I can barely get my feet into these boots.  Length wise they are fine.  It's the width and height that is out of line.  Once you get these on, they do stretch out a little.  The sizing issues lead to another big problem.<br /><br />Cushion - These boots have the least amount of cushion of any boots I have ever owned.  These are going to wreck your feet.  Normally gel inserts are nice to have.  In this case, gel inserts are a MUST HAVE.  They will be they only cushion you have.  That leads to a big issue.  There is ZERO room for gel inserts.<br /><br />Build - Looking at the boots makes me hesitate.  I do not trust the build.  They look glued together.  Nothing about these boots gives me the impression that they are going to last as long as my trail runners have.  I'll test them on a few 10 mile hikes and see how they hold up.  I just hope I don't get stuck five miles from the trail head with a busted boot.<br /><br />Value - Not much.  Not many places carry these so it's hard to price hunt.  If you pick these up for $150 you will not get value out of them.  Go buy some nice boots and avoid these.  If you can get these for under $100, you might get some value out of them.	2015-08-05

At 162.00 stay away, there are plenty of better shoes you can get for that price.  Well these shoes fit perfectly and were very light.  The leather looks like corrected grain. These are cemented shoes and cannot be resoled. For the price I did pay I would say these shoes are on par with some of the Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole, Aldo and cheaper Florsheim shoes. I was looking for flaws since they came from China and found none and was very surprised how well built they were. Shoes are comfortable enough for me to wear all day, I am in and out my car all day for work and do a lot of walking and my feet were not sore by the end of the day. After wearing about 5 times the leather is noticibly creased and I seem to have to polish these shoes after each wear as parts of it looks faded. The leather is kind of thin as well.  I would definitely buy these again for the price I paid as they are cheap but very nice looking disposables and better than any Payless brand. If you are looking to spend full retail might I suggest you look into some higher end Florsheims. Same fit as the Florsheim Jet line but the Florsheims are definitely way nicer with leather bottoms and heels that can be replaced by a cobbler.  Once these shoes are worn down, they are done but so far the wear is slow vs some of my other shoes I wear.	2015-08-05

They also seem very comfortable since the toes are well wrapped in. However, this particular style somehow wears out easily if you have an active toddler. I had Jude before this and it lasted longer. Our Craig, however, got a lot of marks on the front and broke within two weeks of use. They were still wearable but looked very old and broken. We purchased a second pair eventually and the front still got worn out pretty easily.<br /><br />Also, as other See Kai Run sandals, they run large. We worn size 7 SKR flats but had to wear 5 or 6 for these sandals.<br /><br />I still love them, because I really like the softness of SKR shoes and their designs. They really look great with anything, from play sets to formal clothes. But the trade off is that they are not durable and I kind of can't believe that we need 3 pairs of sandals in 4 months.	2015-08-05

This product was ordered for my son.  The page indicated to order a size or two larger than normal because they run a little small.  I went one size larger because I didn't want them to be too large...I should have went with two sizes larger.  They are a bit narrow on his foot and it fits exactly to the edge.  He can wear them now, but they won't fit for too much longer once he grows again.  The shoe is made of good quality and won't break easily from normal wear and play.  He wore them all day yesterday and said that his feet were just fine; no sores or anything like that.  He loves them.  The box they came in is made of a cardboard material and so cute!  Inside the box was a bag that he has already loaded up with toys and carrying around.  The box also came with an area to place extra decals for the shoes.

I have been looking for a certain kind of wedge sandal since spring of this year. I found them in this shoe. The shoes are so cute and a get lots of compliments in them. I was amazed when I initially tried them on as a size 10 has rarely ever been too large on me. I am a 10 and can sometimes wear a 9.5, but 10 is really true to my size. I have a normal-wide foot and the toe part of the shoe is a tad loose and wide. Toes of shoes are normally too small for my feet in flats, sandals and heels. If you are truly a 10 they should fit, but know that they could be a tad big. They are not too big to wear or be comfortable though. They are the most comfortable heels of any sort that I have ever worn and they have a good height to them, but are so easy to walk in as they are platform with a wider wedge at the heel which I was looking for. So many wedges have a very narrow heel like regular heels which barely makes them any more comfortable to wear, but these are wide without looking odd. I'm a fan!	2015-08-05

The heel drop, amount of cushion, all perfect.  However, the sole flexes in such a way that the hexagonal/rhombus tiles separate as you run, which leaves enough room for  little pebbles and mud to get stuck there.

I love my pair of black lace (w/ floral fabric lining) and  was excited to find these on amazon in so many colors. Sadly the natural (lace) pair I purchased feel a full size too small!  The shoes do not have any label, it is located on a sticker on the sole and my original pair have long since lost that sticker.  I usually wear a 10 and ordered the linen lace in a 10 and they feel like a 9.  So I've measured them and they measure to a size 9.  The sticker on the sole says they are &#34;Elsa, size 10M made in china&#34;.  The box says they are Lawrie size 10M.  My original pair are actually a size 10.5 so it makes sense these don't fit, but they are way smaller than what a half size would be.  I wear 9.5 - 10 comfortably, this color is oddly sized.  Have to return.	2015-08-05

Many things about this bag are perfect-the size, the overall design, the hidden rear pouch, the material.  It's perfect for travel and I thought it was going to be exactly what I have been looking for for quite some time!  However, there is one major huge flaw that really disappointed me.  The credit card slots inside the main compartment are not wide enough to hold credit cards horizontally!  Just a tad too short.  So you can use the slots only if you turn the cards vertically, in which case the slots are too big and the cards flop around and are not very secure.  So I will not be able to use this feature which is a shame because it is one of the main reasons I bought this bag. I think I am stuck keeping it because I don't have time to find a replacement. for an upcoming trip.	2015-08-05

I've worn this pair around town for several days now, and it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing shoes, they're that comfortable.  I hope they're durable, as they're going to see a LOT of miles in the next couple of weeks!  Update:  The original black pair of these has held up VERY well.  I wear them often.  They are my favorite Vionic sandals (I have two other styles).  I now own them in black, white, and cork.  Love!	2015-08-05

I previously purchased these glasses and was extremely happy with them.  I wanted to have another set available so went with the gun metal frames.

What I received was not what was described.  I received a smoke lens and a see-through orange and blue lens.  There was no &#34;mirror&#34; to these lenses.

Already the soles are beginning to wear.  I'm a little disappointed in the sole quality of the ASICS shoes this being the reason I did not give the Nimbus 5 stars, I have to see how the ASICS Nimbus holds up.  I purchased the Nimbus-17 because it is supposed to be the best women's running shoe for troubled knees.  So far the shoe has lived up to this claim, I have had no knee pain during my runs or after and my feet felt great.  The style is very attractive. My Cumulus shoes were a size 8 1/2 so I ordered the same in the Nimbus-17 however the Nimbus are a little longer than the Cumulus, but the width is fine. I would recommend any ASICS shoe, just a little concerned with the quick wear of the soles.	2015-08-05

I have a flat arch at the front of my feet(making it wide) and my other two arches are fairly high( making the back of my feet narrow). My medial arch ( one between big toe and heel) is exceptionally high. It is extremely difficult to find good shoes for me because of this, even though i'm only in my early twenties. High heels are usually out of the question because my medial arch will not even touch the shoe! I found these and i've been wearing them for over a month and a half now. I have to say out of all the shoes i've tried on the store, these were the most comfortable. Compared to the Go Walk 2, these offer more support for the foot and have better cushioning.They actually conform to my feet easier because of the design on the bottom. The individual circular parts of the sole actually press into the crevices of your feet making it very comfortable, while the rest of the sole just adds a bit of cushioning.( To see what i'm talking about look at the pictures. You'll see some from the middle to the top of the toe area that looks different from the rest of the sole. That the main thing that is different from the go walk 2,which adds a little more comfort and well worth the price difference in my opinion. ) The reason I gave them four stars was only because i'm starting to feel some foot pain again after standing on them all day. To remedy this for a few more months, I am getting a very thin insole with gel to relieve some of the pressure that has begun to accumulate on the heels of my feet and the lateral part of the distal portion of my feet( towards pinky toe). This I know is from how I walk and the material at the bottom of the shoes makes them slightly easier to wear out then harder soled shoes. After I few more months I will buy another pair to keep the support and shock absorption at healthy level for my feet( we should change out shoes anyway to help our joints and feet to stay healthy!) However, for theprice they are excellent! If you are not able to dish out a few hundred bucks for shoes or are considering other shoes that are below 100 dollars, these are where to look! Obviously try to find a store that sells them and try them on first if you have the option. For the men's shoe it was way to wide in the back of the foot for my boyfriend, while for me it was perfect even with my narrow heel. For my budget I will definitely buy them again once these wear down!  Note: For those looking for shoes that are very hardy and will last on rough surfaces, these shoes are not for you. These shoes have a softer sole. This makes great for casual jobs or walks because it cushions the foot and does conform to a good degree to all feet types. Because of this softer, squishy sole they will not hold up well over time on rugged surfaces ( they are not made for that).They are also very lightweight and are more of a slip on type of shoe. (Again, this shoe is not made for the industrial work environment.) They are also not very slip resistant, but I have noticed that water doesn't seep in the top of the shoes of the black colored version I have. Also I'd like to not that because of the design they are not made for custom orthotics or any large insole, because you simply won't have room! I hugs my feet already( in a good way) and adding a bulky insole will not only hurt my feet but mostly likely won't fit in the shoe before even adding my feet in it. That is why i'm only getting a very thin insole to put inside it. Overall great shoe just keep in mind these things when purchasing!	2015-08-05

I am a dog groomer, and I usually wear Crocs, which are very comfortable, however do not breathe AT ALL. My feet sweat so bad in them, and then smell terribly by the end of the day. I came across an ad for these fit kicks on Facebook, and thought they would be great to try. First of all, I hate to wear shoes, and these things barely feel like a sock. Some would not like them I'm sure, because they do not offer any support whatsoever. I found they worked very well for me, other than the fact that I have chubby feet, and the XL's were still a bit snug. So if your feet are on the larger side, be forewarned. Overall I am happy, but i am hoping they don't fall apart too quickly (there is nothing too them really).	2015-08-05

Super light, and arguably the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned (honestly, every Etnies shoe I've purchased was ridiculously comfortable). They can be a pain to get into if you don't loosen the laces completely, but other than that they're great. Very minimal, close fitting, and breathable. I normally wear an 11 in a standard shoe, so I went for the 11.5 and they fit just right. Everyone's different, but it's a safe bet to go at least half a size up, maybe a whole size if you wear a few different sizes.	2015-08-05

That being said, I love these boots.  They fit perfectly and first day I wore them I clumsily stepped in a big puddle, about ankle deep.  My feet didn't notice a thing.  I was concerned at first that the top of the boot, where it meets the leg, is really thin.  It hasn't been a problem yet, but I usually wear medium thick socks just in case.  I would recommend these without hesitation.	2015-08-05

My wife is a slim 5ft.7in., and our make-up artist/stylist an equally slim 5ft.6in.,yet both get hung up by the fact that our glamour/boudoir photo business regularly attracts slender young women of 5ft.8in. plus as customers. Since discovering these high-healed  sneakers, both have bought five or six pairs each in an attempt to claw back this height disadvantage. They look exceptionally nice and do give the illusion of extra height and longer legs; unfortunately the other day we had an Austrian girl come along who was 6ft. tall, even before she put on a pair of strappy 6in. heels to pose in.............!!  Despite this, my wife tells me I'm to award these boots five stars and comment that they're exceptionally comfortable.	2015-08-05

I got so many compliments too. The gold piece on the back is a great accent and the heel is a perfect height (I'm almost 6' tall so I don't want anything too tall).

So cute but I ordered them thinking a little dog would be cute for my son. Well the color is off in picture. When they arrived they look much closer to a pink color not really salmon like I was thinking. Love these for indoor use around house with having cooler floors and a wood stove. A must for any Alaskan baby!!! I had a hard time finding shoes that were wide and would stay on for a long period of time when traveling. I currently use a different older pair everyday during winter and they are really soft now and worn in. Don't wash or dry in dryer. When they get wet I let them air dry then rub them till they get soft again. Tend to stretch out over time too which I don't mind my guy has little block feet. ;)	2015-08-05

I purchased these shoes for Krav Maga, Patriot Knife Fighting, and Ketsugo mat work.  I got my shoes today and unfortunately will have to return them for a larger size.  Normally I wear size 11, so after reading the many reviews, I went up to size 11.5 which is too small.  The width is somewhat narrow, but not so much that it wouldn't work for my needs.<br /><br />I'm ordering the size 12 today and will return the 11.5.  As far as construction and looks... well made shoes and i didn't see any flaws or problems that would cause them to fall apart or anything like that.  ASICS puts out a good product, but if you want these, go up a full size.<br /><br />An update:  I got the size 12's and the length is great, however, the width of these shoes is very narrow in comparison to my normal shoes.  I can still use them and so far they are comfortable enough, however, if you have a wide foot then these are not the shoes for you.	2015-08-05

I gave them only a 3-star because the platform is covered in some kind of burlapy kind of material - not leather, and the heel is barely 3 inches. So in my opinion, they are a little dorky looking. I know that Clarks are known for their comfort, not so much for style but with a tiny bit higher heel and maybe a leather platform base, they would be more attractive in my opinion. The leather cut-outs look really nice on the foot though. I will keep them as I bought them on sale at a great price and they are very comfy -- especially after worn a few times (they are comfortable from the get-go but when first worn, the cut-out areas can stick a little to your foot).	2015-08-05

Not sure if JS shoes are for meatier feet, but on me, a bit roomy though perfect in length.  And attractive style.	2015-08-05

After a few days break in , these are the best work shoes I have ever owned . Unfortunately I paint cars for a living , so they are taking a beating cosmetically. But I can work 8 to 10 hours a day on a concrete floor and my feet don't hurt . Considering buying another pair and wearing them away from work . Very tough construction and I love the laces . Definitely recommend these for anyone who works on their feet .!!!!!!! Update : two years later I ordered my second pair , only because my original pair looked awful but were still functional, I paint cars for a living so it takes a huge toll on their appearance. Unboxed this second pair and I'm in love all over again . Unfortunately I will surely destroy these as well , but not my feet ! Highly recommended shoes !	2015-08-05

I live the contrasting heel in white against the high quality leather. Thought the lack if shoe laces would appear odd, but not so. Now, I tried on without thin trouser socks, and it's a close fit.

Overall the product is very satisfying and I will update this as time wears them	2015-08-05

In 41 Russian size I bought 10. Just I want to mention that I feel any shoes when walking fast. Then, get out all the flaws. At first glance, upon delivery to me like these sandals. Skin is soft, very comfortable, and I was approached by size. I walk a lot and quickly, and therefore the first sock I rubbed his ankles in the outer area of the bone and the foot near the big toe. Even so, I put 5 stars because my leg is capricious and after a while they will become my most favorite. Color was a bit paler than I expected (I bought Clementine ), but tanned skin they will look beautiful. I advise everyone.	2015-08-05

The good news is, baby will be able to wear them next summer as well hopefully. We needed water shoes for water play at day care and they served that purpose. He will only wear them one or two times at the end of the summer season. I like the adjustable feature, they were easy to get on his foot. They also seem to be made well (only used them once). Decent product for a decent price.	2015-08-05

I was happy with the size, especially since they are slip-ons.  I use inserts too for extra cushioning and the inserts actually make them fit a little more comfortable. I wear a 7 and have a normal width foot.  They didn't have as much memory foam as I had hoped, so not quite as cushiony as some other skechers.  They are pretty good at being slip proof, which I really needed.  The down side is after wearing them all day (10 hrs +) my feet are killing me. If it is 6 hrs or less I am okay with them.  Think I will use them on less busy days at work and where my shifts are shorter, they do look nice.  I will use my more tennis shoe looking skechers for the longer shifts as they have better cushioning.	2015-08-05

However after my first run I'm convinced I got the right size and that a half-size smaller would probably be a tad too small. so I'm happy with the size.<br />- very light. you can barely tell they are on.<br />- true that they are incredibly comfortable out of the box and make it easy to run. This is great. but it doesn't seem they are great for arch support.<br />- the main 'body' of the shoe is comprised of like a 'mesh' - this is great for keeping the shoes light, but know that your foot is going to get wet if the shoe gets wet...  it's nice that they are so breathable, but probably not going to be the best bet in wintertime...<br />- the sole doesn't have 'cleat' texture but is flat. the material of the sole is great and I noticed right away when I went on a slick, wet floor, they held firm. Very nice. good traction that is probably a little better for running on the road rather than the trail; but great for both from what I could tell today.<br /><br />For quality trail-running shoes, these would be very tough to beat at their current price on Amazon. Hard to gauge how long they will last; due to the light weight of the shoe, they almost feel flimsy and prone to falling apart. But they are obviously good quality and live up to the reputation. Kudos to Amazon for the super fast free shipping.	2015-08-05

They are light, airy, highly cushioned, comfortable, and fit true to size (to me as a wide-feet individual). I had a pair in size 6.5M (width: 3-3/8 inches; length: 9.5 inches), and found that they fit me very well both width and length. I normally wear hiking shoes in size 7M-7.5M (in Salomon hiking boots), so for this pair of sneakers to fit my wide fit means they will be a little wide for individuals who usually wear medium-width shoes. Therefore, if you have wide feet, I'd recommend to go true to your sneakers size or 1/2 a size down (if you plan to wear them with thin socks). If you have medium or narrow feet, I'd suggest to go 1 size down. The design of the toe elongates my feet; even though they are wider than average sneakers, they do not make my feet look wide. In addition to that, the textile upper is light and soft, which makes them quite comfortable to wear. The pink color accent is more like a hot/ neon pink and very pretty, not purplish like in these photos.	2015-08-05

I found them to be about as far from a &#34;walking shoe&#34;, as you can get. I read the reviews, and ordered a half size larger, and still my big toe hit the end. The shoe seemed very wide at the heel, and I couldn't get the strap tight enough to stop the shifting there, every time I took a step. My heels are not exceptionally narrow. There is absolutely NO arch support, and felt as if I was walking on a plank. The soles are very thick and heavy, I can only assume that is the manufacturer's reason for thinking they could call these a walking shoe. If you want a heavy, clunky Frankenstein shoe, go for it.... I only wore these for about an hour, since my feet started hurting almost as soon as I put them on. I wanted to give them a chance, but it wasn't worth it.	2015-08-05

The kids go hiking, rock climbing, and splashing around in a large creek. She's been wearing these sandals every day for a couple of months now, and aside from being dirty, they're not showing any signs of wear. See photo.<br /><br />The first couple of days, they did rub her feet a little so she alternated them with her sneakers for a few days but she easily prefers these to her sneakers and after those first couple of days she's wearing them every day.<br /><br />I was very glad for the other reviews about sizing. She normally wears about a 4 or maybe a 4.5. I ordered the 5 in this sandal. Very happy with these sandals.	2015-08-05

It is not as stiff as pictured, it's kinda soft and floppy so doesn't sit as pictured. Other people said their hardware was plastic but mine is metal and screwed together pretty firm. It does have a leathery smell to it but no where near as stinky as I was worried about. My interior is not black as pictured.  It's tan with &#34;Jonbag&#34; writing all over it. Not exactly as pictured but nothing major to be upset about. The hardware came with a sticky plastic protectant over it so the metal doesn't get scratched I assume but that was a pain to get off. I actually unscrewed the hardware to get the plastic off completely. I like the adjustable strap to wear cross body and the gold hardware on the bottom of the purse to rest on.	2015-08-05

I was impressed beyond words. The bad part was, after three days of wearing them in dry limited conditions (all on clean paved surfaces) I noticed that there was a tear in the front seem (where your foot and the shoe naturally bends) on the left shoe. It's not all the way through and appears to be mostly cosmetic however it's hard to be sure (I haven't used them in water or anything). I expect some wear and tear on the cosmetics side of things but not after three days of casual use. Now it looks like they have a hole in them, which I don't like.  I would try these again because they were so comfy but buyer beware the quality of construction.	2015-08-05

I'm a 7 1/2 - 8 and I ordered an 8. I should have gotten a 7.  Now, I got these because the arch support and the deep heel cup are supposed to help with plantar fasciitis, however...that has not been my experience.  Furthermore, within an hour of wearing, they make my toes stink!  Doesn't matter if I just got out of the shower, if I only wore them around the house, if I used foot powder.  And no, I do not have an issue with smelly feet.  I would understand if I was wearing these for 10 hours straight on a hot, humid day of...I dunno...furniture moving, or something.  But without my feet even getting sweaty at all these leave me with stinky toes.  I would gladly put up with that IF they helped with the plantar fasciitis.  They don't.  No improvement at all.  Now they just sit in my closet floor.  Wish I hadn't wasted the money on them.	2015-08-05

They fit well, though the left shoe is a little snug on my foot but I think that has to do with some swelling that I encounter with that foot anyway. I like the way the sole is designed with the &#34;Heel Ball&#34; inbedded. This gives a nice cushion to my foot in that area as this is a source of foot pain daily for me when I am standing on my feet a lot at work. I can wear these shoes all day at work and be comfortable with long periods of standing. Thank you. May order some additional colors in time.	2015-08-05

I bought these as a shoe to wear around the house and I think they are really comfortable (have almost a pillow type feel - maybe because my Zoot slides are worn out that I noticed such a dramatic difference). I have worn them upwards of 8 hours and had no problems. I have flat arches and there is no real arch support but for what I bought them for they have so far served their purpose. It is a comfortable shoe to wear around the house or go run an errand etc. If I where to go somewhere that required a lot of walking (over a mile) then I would elect to wear a shoe with arch support for my feet. The shoe was a little tight at first by within a few hours, they stretched to fit the width of my foot.	2015-08-05

The comfort is terrific, same as all my other danskos.  However, as I'd read in another review, the &#34;lattice&#34; on the top of the right shoe has already started coming apart, just one month after purchase (maybe just a tiny bit over a month).  Naturally, I am not happy with that.  My  suggestion is to make a rubber shoe with a similar design, only do it embossed on solid rubber.	2015-08-05

They look good with street clothes yet have enough cushioning to run in.  They are extremely flexible and feel weightless.  If you are a runner and you enjoy minimal shoes these could be a great fit for you.  If you are new to running or have a pronation issue these might not right for you as they lack support and structure.<br />If you are looking at these shoes for casual wear or non running activities I say go for it, they are very comfortable and stylish.<br />They run a bit small so you MIGHT want to order a 1/2 size larger than normal.  I'm always a 10 and that works for me in these shoes, but I noticed they are a tiny bit smaller than most other size 10 running shoes I have purchased.	2015-08-05

I bought them to wear at a resort that has various water slides, lazy river, etc.  In the past, I've burned my feet walking around the resort while getting to the different attractions.  These shoes were the perfect solution!  They are very comfortable.  I wore them several days in a row without any issue (and I am prone to getting blisters).  I normally wear a 71/2.  I bought both an 8 and 7 (because they do not come in half sizes).  I chose to keep the 8.  The 7 was just a bit too small, but I probably could have worn them if necessary.	2015-08-05

I have a heavy duty pair of hiking boots, but let's be real...they're a little much to wear all day.

Sadly they are too big for me. I have narrow bony feet and the Velcro adjustment was way too long for my feet. They are well made and I was looking forward to wearing a slipper that freed my big toes. However, not all is lost. My husband is happily wearing them. They are perfect for him. We've been having trouble finding something that would fit his short stubby feet that wouldn't flop around. With the adjustment he can make them perfect for him. He's a big sheepskin fan and lives in his winter UGGS so these are perfect for summer.	2015-08-05

I'm flat footed and work in an environment that requires me to be on my feet about 80% of my day and requires steel toe protection. Every other boot I've worn, I couldn't stand in them for more than a few hours. Ever since I purchased these boots, I would never go back to another brand again! I stood, walked and even jogged in these boots for hours at a time! I wouldn't recommend running in these, but if needed, you can! To me these felt extremely comfortable to wear, more comfortable than any other shoe I've worn, and would even wear these boots in a business environment as business shoes also give me problems when standing in them for over an hour as most shoes now a days have this elevated heel design. This may work for some people, but for me, I can't stand it. These boots fit perfectly for me. Snug, comfortable and have lasted over 2 years now from constant wear and tear. If you're in the law enforcement or private security field, I personally recommend these for long assignments.	2015-08-05

Alas, while these promised to be comfortable, even if they had fit I didn't see the style (while flattering to the foot) as being an adequate replacement.  If they had fit, I would have kept.  When I went to return, the smaller 1/2 size down was no longer available, even in an unpleasant color.	2015-08-05

Finding boots is always a pain for me. I can't wear anything with a heel and my calves are super duper wide. I never order shoes online and I only took a chance on these because I know that Roxy boots are made all around wider than most. I was nervous after I ordered them, waited two days (thank you Amazon Prime,) and they fit right out of the box! I wear an 8.5 and ordered an 8.5 in the tan; perfect fit. I needed these for one event where I'm going to be on my feet for 12+ hours and I'm confident I'll be comfy in these. They're so squishy! Now that I have them, I'm going to wear them long past that one event. They match nearly everything I own, look adorable with dresses, and my feet don't get sweaty in them. There's no plastic sole or anything that would irritate my calf. They're soft and comfy and all shoes should be as great as these. Whenever they wear out, I'm buying another pair just like them!	2015-08-05

I did not stay with this design because all the ones I've seen now have high sheen leather that will scratch as opposed to the Napa leather of my Italian made one.

That said, this is a climbing shoe more than a trekking shoe and its performance is optimized accordingly and it climbs up to mid-5th class rock well with good technique.<br /><br />For trekking expect some discomfort in the thinly padded forefoot over the course of high mileage days but otherwise the down-to-toe lacing and reasonable roomy toe box (at least for a scrambling shoe) allows the hiker with well-conditioned feet all-day comfort if the terrain is rough/rocky (which means lower mileage/speed vs. easy trail).<br /><br />This is among the stiffer approach shoes out there (hence it's climbing/edging performance) which has the benefit of being a very effective shoe in scree, traversing on steep sidehills, snow, and when paired with crampons for the incidental glacier crossing.<br /><br />So why 4 stars instead of 5? Antiquated use of leather in the upper. I'd prefer newer, lighter, and less water absorbent materials, such as the incredible woven fabrics used by Scarpa in their lightweight mountain boots like the Marmolada.	2015-08-05

I found them elsewhere because of the price and have had them for about 4 months. I play softball and have worn turf shoes now for about 5 years.  I started with Nike football turf shoes but those are not made any longer.  I then went to Boomba and I owned four pair of those (two were warranty) and they just fell apart from anywhere around 2 uses to 2 months.  These have held up longer than the Boomba's and seem to do okay.  My feet are usually tired after playing all day but I can't really remember when they weren't.	2015-08-05

Ordered 12 4E size and it seemed a little narrow while walking around the house and mistakenly thought a break-in period might be required.  A 2 mile walk in these shoes was torture due to very thin insoles, narrow width, and absence of arch support.  Removed the cheap very thin insoles and replaced with size 12 4E insoles from Foot Solutions which had to be trimmed for the NB size 12 4E.  This change made the shoes tolerable, however, you should not have to put $80 insoles into shoes labeled 'Country Walking'!  Sad because New Balance used to be a quality comfortable shoe brand with true American 4E widths; now apparently manufactured using International sizing charts.	2015-08-05

The customer service is excellent, and the shoes feel and look great - like combat slippers.<br /><br />My only beef is that the quality of the materials is suspect (eyelets have burrs and tear up laces, leather pulls away easily from the rubber sole, etc.). I actually had to send back the first pair. Were these boots more expensive, I'd certainly be dinging the product for lack of durability.<br /><br />However, these are fairly inexpensive and &#34;you get what you pay for,&#34; I figure. The California-based staff are friendly and professional and quick to handle issues.  As it is, a very comfortable knock-around boot. Perfect for pulling on late at night for a run to the grocery store.	2015-08-05

I went to a runner's store and was told I overpronate. They recommended a Saucony stability shoe that didn't decrease my pain at all. After reading more about plantar fasciitis being caused by narrow, tapered footwear (Podiatrist Ray McClanahan), I decided to try these Altra's for exercise, along with wearing other shoes with wider toe boxes (Franco Sarto Gia sandals, Vans slip ons). My foot pain is pretty much gone. These running shoes fit true to size.	2015-08-05

The shoes are very comfortable, fit perfectly (I wear 7.5, regular)  and should be good for at least 8 to 10 lessons.  They look nice but as mentioned in previous reviews, the soles and heels will not last very long.  I have only worn them once on a hardwood floor for 30 minutes and the heel is already worn down.  I am happy with the purchase because for the price, if I can get 10 uses out of it, it will be a bargain.  I would not wear these outside on the sidewalk as that would wear out the soles and heels very quickly.  I think these shoes are for stage use only.  As for arch support, I don't need it but if you do, you may need to put an insert in.	2015-08-05

I didn't get to try them out because I was out of town for 6 days. I tried them on today Tuesday 8/4/15 and they felt comfortable. However, they were a half size to small. I compared them with the size 10 New Balance I'm currently wearing and you could see they were a 1/2 size to small. I take size 10 but I now have to return them for a size 10 1/2. Once I change them I think I'll really be happy with them. Hope this helps. Glenn	2015-08-05

I bought size 4 for a little boy just turning 1 year old, hoping that  the shoes would be a little big and last him longer. It was small by a lot.  It looked like it would fit a a child of 6 or 7 month old .  The shoes are well made not too wide, almost for a child with long and thinner feet.  Soft and does not have a lot of support.  Good for a child just standing or balancing on his feet, but not really walking yet.  The Velcro is nice to avoid the child taking the shoes off and losing it.  Shoes were so nice that even though they were not cheap in cost, I kept them for a gift to another younger child in the future.  If you want to buy these a would suggest buying 2 or 3 size bigger than you need. Hope this helps.	2015-08-05

They are not as bulky as some of the other models by Keen and I really like the way they look with shorts and long pants.  I would definitely recommend these shoes.	2015-08-05

A whole 1 to 1 1/2 size difference is way too big of a deal, especially if you're not well informed. They will be returned, though beautiful & comfortable. I'm not sure about rebuying, hoping to get the right size. Either way, size 7 is sold out and they don't carry a 6.5. (-_-)   According to Michael Antonio size chart, the size 7.5 fits a foot, from heel to toe, that's 9.5 inches long. As you can see in the photos, the size 7.5 was NOT 9.5 inches in length, but 10 inches. I would recommend measuring your foot, minus half an inch, then buy the size that matches those measurements.	2015-08-05

The Rebecca Minkoff bag is stunning! I loved everything about it -- the color, styling, interior pockets, the lining, the bag handles. There's nothing that I didn't love about the bag except that it was too small for my purposes. The Michael Kor Selma bag is also a beautiful bag. Even though I didn't like the interior pockets as much as the Rebecca Minkoff, it was large enough to accommodate several file folders and is a classy substitute for a small briefcase. Because I could not afford to keep them both, I returned the Rebecca Minkoff bag (reluctantly).	2015-08-05

These are probably the best reading glasses purchase I've ever made. I love the frame's black matte color, which I've found difficult to locate, especially in a pair of inexpensive reading glasses.<br />And since we're talking about the frames, they're also the lightest, most comfortable pair I've ever owned - bar none. You know how some glasses (especially the inexpensive &#34;off the shelf&#34; variety) feel like they're going to deform the ridge of your nose because of the way they pinch, and/or because they have those incredibly uncomfortable pads that sit on (and often slide down) either side of your nose? NOT THIS PAIR!! And by the time we've reached the age to need them 24/7, some reading glasses have caused a painful indentation/groove/deformation above and behind each of our ears - NOT THIS PAIR of bad boys! Because they are SO flexible AND so light, they will fit practically ANY shape/size head - and will do so comfortably and painlessly - and will not deform the bridge of your nose or behind your ears. And yet they still stay in place, hour after hour!!<br />Many reviews have mentioned the fact that you can comfortably wear these glasses while in bed reading and watching your iPad or TV, and it's true. And they do this frustration free, holding the perfect position for reading/viewing pain free as long as you're able to stay awake.<br />It may sound cliche, but you really do forget you're wearing them.<br />These are definitely on my list to buy a second and third pair!	2015-08-05

I have zero arch and these are superb in the way that they provide me with a much better posture for my feet & ankles. I don't have narrow or super wide feet...but these are perfectly wide enough considering I have no natural arch and over-pronating issues. I was skeptical about the claims & surprised when they actually corrected the way I walk. I watched a QVC video that advertised them & the guy said if you need a half size to order a down...he also said that these particular flip flops were for people with medium to wide feet. I have large feet and didn't want to risk them being too short/small or the return process, so I ordered a size up instead and they fit my feet perfectly. So, that'll be your call based on your feet. There's a tip that comes with the shoes that advise that if you're not used to this type of shoe with all the orthotic technology, it's better to wear them a little at a time until your feet gets used to them. Take that advise. It's going to hurt...but now, I'm able to wear them anywhere that requires a lot of walking and my feet much, much better wearing these compared to my other flat, non-orthotic flip flops. I feel more secure concerning stability with these.	2015-08-05

Cannot exchange, only return.  And while the seller states a commitment to completely satisfactory transactions, returns are at the expense of the buyer.  CAVEAT EMPTOR / buyer beware.  Shoes can be funny size-wise, fit-wise, and other-wise.  And that they were.<br /><br />Since, it is possible to purchase them online elsewhere and return them, if you choose to, at no cost, it makes no sense to buy them here.  I wish I had shopped more carefully.  These shoes fit too large, and the construction reminds me of a carton of eggs.  Nothing special, nothing great, not very sturdy.  I kept them because I hate paying for returns.<br /><br />The return policy is clearly stated so my bad for not reading and considering that policy more carefully.  But whether stated or not, I think it is a lousy policy.  I bet you agree.  The shoes are not lousy, but they are not great.  They are not good.  They are less than satisfactory, and I would not buy them again.<br /><br />I recommend neither the shoes nor the seller for the reasons discussed.	2015-08-05

To me, they have a look that is both a classic sophisticated office style, with a hint of vintage rock and roll. It's not my typical style of shoe, but I like the heel a lot on these, the height, and the somewhat vintage styling. I also don't love buckles and zippers on my shoes, so I like the simplicity. Also, I wanted something more sophisticated.<br /><br />They aren't uncomfortable, they just aren't comfort shoes, but I wore them all day at work and rode my bike home in them after and had no feet problems. So, long story short, they are a keeper. I ordered my regular size of 8.5 and they fit fine. A little weird in the front toe area at first, but then you get used to it.	2015-08-05

Very comfortable for the first few months then the padding starts to compress.<br />The tread wears down pretty quickly and the plastic on the sides by the heal rubs the ground.

I am really a fan of these shoes. The all over material is HIGHLY breathable, they are lightweight and really not bad looking at all. I really like the &#34;Memory Foam&#34; insoles that come with these shoes. The insoles are stitched into the bottom of the shoe and are literally like the memory foam you would see on a high end bed. The material wrapped around the foam on the insole is like a neoprene so it is smooth and it really does form to the contours of your feet. I use these for work and you can tell a BIG difference when you are standing. When you start walking and moving around the foam adjusts to your foot as you walk. It's an interesting feeling but provides comfort and support unlike other more expensive shoes that I own. I would absolutely buy another pair. Since they breathe so well my feet don't get sweaty or musty which is always a plus. For the money you should give them a try. I'm sure you will like them.	2015-08-05

I love these and have been tempted to order another pair that have the buckle on the side. These are a nice Italian leather but are made in India. Not a problem for me. I love a nice shoe and one that is a leather sole.	2015-08-05

Low quality and lousy fit.  Specifically the soles on three pairs I have ordered to replace my old 856's ALL had the soles separate within a year or less.  In order to get a pair that were not just flat too narrow (ordered the same exact size as the 856s) I had to order the 2E width, and they were actually a little too wide.<br /><br />I've read the comments about manufacturing moving overseas and considering the drastic drop in quality of the product, it makes sense.  Cheap labor, cheapens the product!<br /><br />No more New Balance products for me.	2015-08-05

These shoes are fantastic! I got the light green/gray combo and love the stylishness, perfect for trails and walks in warmer climates. I bought these for traveling to Hawaii and Australia where I know I will be doing light hiking, occasional trail walking and lots of city walking. I usually wear an 8 1/2 (8 in sandals/flip flops, occasionally 9 in running shoes) and the 8 1/2 in these is a great fit. Not strong arch support, but my foot doesn't fall flat or roll inward like with many other hiking shoes I tried on. Best of all, I got them off Amazon for only $38.	2015-08-05

I absolutely love it. The price dropped 50% off and I bought it right away. Now I'm looking for other colours and similar shoes. I got the white/tan. Sperry doesn't sell these anymore!

I ordered the next size up directly from the company and although the width fit, they were too long. I could step in and out of them without unlacing them.  Don't really want that happening when you're dancing.  I docked starts because although customer service was very helpful/ friendly, they charge you for shipping both ways even with an exchange.  Wound up going with another style from the same company that ran in men's sizing.  I must say, all their shoes are very cute, just tricky if you have a wider foot.	2015-08-05

I have somewhat wider feet (than most ladies) & a high arch - so after reading on some reviews that these didn't have enough arch support, I was a little concerned.  I wear a 7 in most shoes (including KEEN tennis shoes) & I ordered these in a 7 (after reading that most people sized up 1/2 a size).  These fit me fine.  I'm glad I didn't size-up.  The arch support is perfect for me.  They are very comfortable.  My only issue is that my pinky toe on my right food almost slips out of the side top strap (it's fine on the left foot).  I'm going to continue to wear around the house - hoping it's okay - I really like these shoes a lot.  I had read that they look 'boxy&#34; on some people, but I think they look good.  I ordered the MEN's version for my husband - his should be arriving today and I will post a review on his in a few days.	2015-08-05

I wouldn't walk a marathon in them, but for regular daily walking, they are quite comfortable.<br /><br />I added a fleece boot liner to the boots to help them absorb moisture from my feet and to make them more comfortable in the winter.  I would definitely suggest doing that if you plan to wear these boots in any season other than summer.	2015-08-05

Demonia boots all look so great but they tend to all have huge areas around the toes, so that the boot won't even touch your foot on your toes not upper foot in that area. This leads to slippage even though the boot might fit well on the the rest of the foot. I have other Demonia boots also with the same issue. If they'd make them smaller in the foot Id buy more . if you go down sized tho try making it smaller, the length gets short. Because of the big toe box, when you walk, your toes crush against its end because your foot comes forward with no support. Which is sad, because they look exactly like what I want.	2015-08-05

Well of course your sandals are going to get wet - that's what sandals are for, to wear around Water.<br /> In my opinion, a $100 pair of sandals should have a durable and heavy quality foot strap to prevent stretching. The Vionics FAILED on this very important issue. Here is the damaging issue: The straps on these Vionics 'stretched-so-much' that the Velcro (which secures the upper strap to the lower) OVEREXTENDED it's reach to the lower Velcro-Strip so much that I could not fasten the Upper Strap around my foot. (there was no Velcro to fasten to on the bottom strap) So, I went to the local shoe-repair-man and had New and Longer Velcro-Strips sewn on the straps so I could fasten the upper strap to the lower.<br />Bottom-Line: These $100 Vionics are made with cheap-thin-stretchable-leather-straps, and are NO-Match for Quality of The Sperry Top-Siders at 1/2 the price of these Vionics.	2015-08-05

I was quoted $150 for repairs at the local shops (supposedly just the cost of the part with free labor). I can also do it through the warranty program but this super-standard part is back-ordered for 30-40 days(!). So the warranty is a joke.	2015-08-05

It's a really nice, well built shoe, but I have a few gripes. One; why wouldn't they incorporate a simple way to stash laces away? You have to tie them 2-3 times and tuck the laces away...could easily put some kind of easy to use loop or even a lace cover of some kind to keep them out of the way, but they didn't. Two; some kind of toe protection would be nice, after all, this is a &#34;freeride&#34; shoe, isn't it? I knew all of this going in, so I can't complain much. But so, or wouldn't add much weight to the shoe to add these things, and it would make the shoe near perfect for trail riding/walking. Fit wise, I went based off of my shimano shoe size, which is 45,so I ordered 11.5...they fit but slightly too big, so I bought 11's and that's perfect.<br />Good shoe, very good grip.	2015-08-05

I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes! Everyone has come up to me and asked me where I got them. They are definitely true to their size. And they are extremely comfortable for me. I can wear them all day long. I even wore them to an amusement park! I had them on all day and my feet never hurt me. I love that the back actually zippers up. I didn't have to take them off for the rides where your feet dangle! I love all of the embellishments. They are so bright and most of them have a little design on them. It really is a stunning sandal. The only issue I had was that after wearing them awhile, the sides started to lift up. I think it was from bending my foot a lot. But I easily fixed it with some super glue. Hopefully the manufacturer glues them a bit better. It's still not enough of a problem that I am complaining. I fixed it and it's been perfect since. No more lifting on the sides. I really like that is has additional straps on the side of the sandal. It prevents them from flapping up and down as you walk. And they don't bother the sides of my feet at all. I did get these at a discount in exchange for my honest review. And overall, these are honestly one of my favorite sandals to wear. Especially if I'm doing a lot of walking. I definitely recommend them. You won't be disappointed!	2015-08-05

I got these at a great price, so I guess you get what you pay for.	These shoes are comfortable but are too small. They run about a half size smaller than what I normally wear in a 11.5. The width is fine, just too short. They are extremely lightweight. I work in a hot environment and I was hoping the lightweight would be cooler than other shoes. Disappointed in this respect as well. Maybe this would be better if the size was correct. The price was great. I am going order another pair a half size bigger.  Updated review: Have had these several months now and the bottom is beginning to separate on one side. I wear these at work where I am on my feet all day. Maybe for stationary training it might be ok. Lowered my rating to 3 stars.	2015-08-05

I'm not going to be the person to give this a 1 star simply because it didn't meet every possible expectation.  But as a Turtle Beach customer for many years, let me give some warnings about this headset.  The most obvious item is the price tag... $299 US Dollars is something to consider.  It simply is not worth it.  This headset is not garbage, but in my honest opinion it's nowhere near Elite as the title suggests.  Let me see if I can explain:  Sound Quality:  It's good.  Claims to be 7.1 surround and I can't knock it.  But I also can't say it's better than any other stereo headset from Turtle Beach.  Just no way to really simulate true surround sound in speakers that are less than an inch from your ears.  So I'm not one to say the premium $ is well spent here, but the sound isn't bad either.  I will say that the sound isn't very loud, but that may be an XB1 limiting factor here.  Not that I need to have the sound louder, but the max setting is where I kept it when playing Batman Arkham Knight and any softer would have been a huge negative.  Mic:  This is an oddity for sure.  I tested this while leaving voice messages over XBL... playing back the recording sounded great.  But testing via party chat my friends said it wasn't as clear (I was understandable but sounded distant).  This is apparently an issue they are trying to fix via firmware.  At purchase, I was informed via online that firmware updates were suspended.  Maybe it will get better, but the lack of boom mic here will most likely be an issue going forward.  Not having a mic in front of your face is awesome, but the point is to have the best quality possible... that's just not gonna happen with a &#34;built in&#34; mic.  Mic Monitoring:  I'm sorry, but no idea why this has gotten worse over the years.  I had a Gen 1 Turtle Beach headset for the original Xbox.  I was so hyped to have an all in one headset, but it was veryapparent right away how hard it was to talk when I couldn't hear my own voice.  By the time the Xbox 360 had arrived, they had fixed this with Mic Monitoring in their (at the time) latest headsets.  I could hear my own voice when I spoke... the mixture of game audio and chat audio was now perfect.  Somehow this got worse and hasn't improved with this &#34;Elite&#34; headset.  Sure, they do have some mic monitoring, but with game volume turned up to a reasonable level it completely drowns out my voice.  Perhaps some people complained that their own voice was too loud and Turtle Beach turned it down... but IMO, BIG MISTAKE!  I want to hear my voice and my teammates as well as game audio loud and clear... that does not happen here.  You will get very little of your own voice fed back into the headset and that is really a bummer!  Comfort:  Another con for me.  I have a head that is somewhat skinny... taller than it is wide for sure.  And yet these tend to be firm and push in on my head.  No so much that they hurt, but I wouldn't call them comfortable either.  I can't help but wonder how they feel for people with more round heads.  Overall:  Sure, I'm definitely going out of my way to point out the negative.  There are positives for sure, but if you are considering spending $299, you probably already know the good things about this headset and they are all true (blue tooth, android app, presets, etc.).  Like I said in the beginning, I'm giving this 3 stars and not completely trashing it... but I am also returning it.  It's just not up to $299 level (and from what I hear, neither is the Astro A50).  Note:  I had some connectivity issues that led me to believe mine was defective, but that is not part of this review.  In the end, I guess the best way I can describe this headset is that if money were no object, I still wouldn't be completely satisfied with this headset.  There are just too many things (particularly mic monitoring) that Turtle Beach did better almost 10 years ago.  So if money is an issue, I simply cannot recommend.   Update - Comparison to the Turtle Beach Stealth 420X:  IMO the 420X is a much better deal than the Elite 800x.  It is lacking some of the features, but at half the cost I am perfectly fine with no bluetooth connectivity, simulated surround sound, and a bunch of presets I'll never use.  The Stealth 420X has a MUCH better microphone, much improved mic monitoring, easier to use controls, better wireless connectivity, and is more comfortable (probably because it is much lighter and doesn't fit near as tight on your head).  I will most likely post a review of the 420X on that product if you want more details.	2015-08-05

I have always wanted to try the Ear Force X12 and I am so glad I did. They sound just as good as the X11 just with a lot more base. You do have the power to control the base if you don't want that much. The ear phones are cuffed around your ears so comfortable and the sound seems to stay within the headset and not bothering others around me! Great Headset is all I can say and will look forward to getting these again whenever my old ones break down or wear out!!!	2015-08-05

Not a lot of stealth involved. There are times you can try to sneak, but it's pretty much run and gun (or sword in Raiden's case). It's a pleasant departure from normal MGS when you feel the need to just go HAM on some bad guys	2015-08-05

US	49116462	R9NLZPUPTMU0M	B00IQCRKT8	575580052	Batman: Arkham Knight	Video Games	4	0	0	N	Y	Infamously Batman	There are quite a lot of reviews up here and almost all of them compare Knight to the other Arkham games. Fair enough as those are all good and worth noting. But I couldn't help and compare it with 3 (4 if you count the long-ish DLC) other games—namely the Infamous series.  I love the Arkham series. Fantastic game play and everyone knows Arkham games are magnificent &#34;be Batman&#34; simulators. But for some reason I couldn't help and compare Knight to the more recent PS4 Infamous—another super hero simulator. And there were some things I really missed from Infamous. One is the city inhabitants. Infamous has been populating its cities with bystanders to save (or maim) since 2009. Why hasn't Batman followed suite. As the 2nd game set in the open Gotham City (assuming we count Origins), I expected Knight to finally give me people to save from muggings, ledge jumpers to leap in and reason with, hostages to rescue from costumed villains, etc. None of that was in the game. This Arkham game like all those before it is set in an environment completely populated by villains due to a plot device. Why? I think any perfect super hero simulator provides citizens to rescue.  Of course, having citizens in the city presents the issue that Batman might hurt the citizens or interact negatively with them. Maybe that's why they haven't been there through all these games. Infamous solves that dilemma by offering story paths. Are you a good hero who always saves and never harms citizens or are you the vigilante power unto yourself that the authorities say you are? You get to decide that as you play in Infamous. I don't think I'd advocate going that far with a Batman game—in the end of the day the rules of who Batman is are set somewhat in stone—but I think something like that could have been incorporated. Thugs in Knight run around saying Batman has gotten darker or more unhinged. But I didn't really see that other than in a few cut scenes. Could have been fun to have the option to play a more Dark Knight Batman by not caring nearly so much about how you interact with the citizens and thereby earning the unhinged reputation. Or a more Caped Crusader Batman who is very conscientious of the citizens and clearly keeping it together. The story already provided would have supported that well and could have made for a couple of easy branching endings depending on how much Scarecrow really managed to drag you as Batman down into the muck. All this comes around to choice, which I didn't feel like the game offered quite enough of. Admittedly, story choice is not a feature of the series. But there were several points where I'd wanted to be able to have Batman do A instead of B but the game didn't allow my idea of what Batman (or at least MY Batman) would do to work. You had to follow the rails.  Great game. Beautiful graphics. Engaging story. Plenty to like. Just a few tweaks could have really set it apart from its predecessors.	2015-08-05

Things you need to know before you buy this FightStick<br />If you have a question comment I will try to respond as soon as I can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It works it does what it suppose to do.<br />-Really good weight to it.<br />-Cord is long Around 9ft I believe<br />-Works on ps3 and ps4<br />-Easy to change art makes the wet/oily look go away depending on type paper you use.<br />-Easy joystick and button modding without voiding warranty. example(You don't like sanwa and want to use Kuro button or w.e buttons you like as long as they are same dimensions of course. Same with joystick part.)<br /><br />Cons<br />-The plexi glass it comes with is really cheap and it gives it almost a wet/oily look to it.(best example I can give is when you try to put new screen protector on your phone and it's not on correctly you can see like the wet marks that it needs to be re adjusted so it can go away)<br />-The mini tool it comes with to remove the plexi glass and side panels broke after undoing 2 screws. So get your own tool if you are going to mod this there cheap but its nice that they include it other people might have better experience with there's.<br />-No touch pad<br /><br />Would I recommend this FightStick Yes since there is only 2 routes to go either Hori($150) or Mad Catz($199.99) (as of now 8/5/2015) I owned many Mad Catz sticks before none failed on me so I am sticking with them. They are also easy/mod friendly without voiding the warranty which is always a plus (can't mod hori sticks or else you void warranty even if one button messes up replacing it voids the warranty its the reason I go with mad catz)<br /><br />Now all of them will have the wet/oily look to it since the glossy paper is under the really thin crappy plexi glass. If this does not bother you then yes by all means get the FightStick it works. But if it's going to bother you then I would suggest either getting custom art work on it or get the HORI Real Arcade Pro 4. But if looks doesn't matter somuch to you the stick is great works perfectly also 2 years of warranty and you can mod it without voiding the warranty.<br /><br />Took some pictures to show how the art work looks like if you replace it which for me made the wet/oily look on the plexi glass go away since its not touching the glossy/plastic original artwork.<br />On one picture I am folding the art work to show it's not paper but a glossy/plastic type artwork.(Note the plexi glass it comes with is around the same thickness of the original artwork which I am bending in the picture so it bends the same way like I said it's really cheap and crappy Plexi glass.<br /><br />I know I repeated a lot of same things but I want to just get it the word out there. Since I almost didn't buy it since the reviews where so bad but it's honestly just little things that I guess ticked people off.	2015-08-05

I got this controller after I received an Xbox One as a birthday present.  It is the newest version so I thought it would be the best.  I definitely appreciate the upgrades (mic jack and better bumper response) but have had trouble with it from the start.  I used the AA batteries that came with it and synced it up right away.  The next day I couldn't get the controller to come on.  I tried researching the issue but didn't find any help.  After thinking about it I swapped the batteries from the Xbox One supplied controller.  Now this new controller turned on but my original one didn't.  I thought, &#34;thanks for the cheapo (Duracell) batteries Microsoft&#34;.  However, after playing for a few minutes and confirming this new controller did in fact work fine, I shut it down for the day.  Then the next day I tried to start it up and once again the controller will not turn on.  I am assuming this thing eats batteries.  Literally, the controller was on for about an hour and the next day it is dead.  I must be draining it somehow even when off.  I am really frustrated with this issue!	2015-08-05

For the price you couldn't really expect something great but I expected it to be a little bit more than this cheap, easily breakable plastic pieces... Honestly, it Looks good both on here and irl but the quality is not worth the price you pay.<br />DO NOT GET IT FOR PS3 GAMES OR BLU RAYS. I bought this mainly for the new ps3 games I recently got and it was a big mistake it does not properly hold them. What I do is put things that Do fit on it towards the bottom (which are regular dvds, xbox 360 game cases or gamecube. ect. cases of that size) so basically the ps3 games are being held up by the cases that actually fit and not by the tower itself. Honestly it holds gamecube, wii or xbox 360 game cases well so if you need one for those... it's not a horrible purchase. but do not buy for ps3, it is not for all consoles as it is advertised.	2015-08-05

It's the best RPG pokemon game I've ever played. I highly recommend this to a pokemon fan.  Unlike the cute,simple gameplay pokemon is known for,this game is dark. The storyline is very deep,and full of dark themes. The player is a young boy,he is part of team Snag,a evil team that takes pokemon and use the darkness they have. The young boy teams up with a girl,and the two go around snagging pokemon. You can steal trainers pokemon,if their a shadow pokemon. Shadow pokemon have shadow moves,and are evil. Every battle is a double battle,but it's fun. There are tons of towns and cities. There are pokemon Centers and shops. Tons of trainers you can fight too. This game is well made,and is a great RPG. The graphics are amazing for a pokwmon game. Pokemon Stadium was great,but not as good as Pokemon Colosseum.  Since you can play Nintendo GameBoy games on the Nintendo GameCube,trade your Ruby and Sapphire pokemon onto your game. There are tons of awesome pokemon like Bayleaf in Colosseum,so trade it into Ruby and Sapphire.  There is a Colosseum,battle area,and you can battle pokemon on different modes. Like easy,medium,and hard. There are different teams too. You can even trade your Ruby and Sapphire pokemon into it to fight.  GET THIS GAME!!!! IT ROCKS!!!! STORYLINE AND POKEMON ROCK!!!!

A small USB stick plugs into the Xbox One. Then you turn on the headphones. That's it!  These headphones come pre-paired to the USB stick.  There are small red and blue lights on the mic that flash as the headphones search for the wireless signal.  The light will turn a solid color once the signal is connected.<br /><br />The power button also functions as a mute button.  It is easy to tell if the mic is muted because these headphones utilize a brilliant mic monitoring system: you can hear your voice through the headphones when the mic is on.  Headphones without mic monitoring tend to muffle your voice which leads to yelling/speaking loudly.  When the mic is muted the mic monitoring is also off, so you can't hear that audible feedback.<br /><br />A small button at the bottom corner of the headphones toggles between two available modes.  The mode displays a color code on the tiny LED on the edge of the boom mic.<br /><br />&#34;Red&#34; mode is a bass boost. Explosions and rich thunderous sounds are perfect for gaming.<br /><br />&#34;Blue&#34; mode is pure audio mode.  This mode is perfect for watching TV.<br /><br />The padded headband adjusts for different head sizes.  The leather-like ear pads are both soft and reduce external noise.  Above the ears, two volume wheels control the overall volume and balance between game and chat volume. The fit was overall very comfortable.<br /><br />The retractable boom mic worked well.  My friends reported a clear voice.  I really liked that the mic stows inside in the headphone for storage.<br /><br />The only &#34;negative&#34; I found with these headphones is the same negative I find with all the Xbox One wireless headphones.  The headphones work best with a fresh boot of the system, and the signal can be a little touchy if you move your head. Overall, I can recommend these headphones for anyone searching for a fully wireless option for their Xbox One.mmend these headphones for anyone searching for a fully wireless option for their Xbox One.	2015-08-05

Before I got these I had heard that they would periodically loose connection. They do. My first trial was on TMNT Turtles in Time. It lost connection twice in half an hour. Both times I'm getting beat up and loosing lives and for no reason it synced back up and I was playing again. This could be very frustrating when playing sports games, fighting games, well, any game. If they could fix that issue this would be great. They are comfortable to hold and I didn't have any issue with button response, except for the full disconnection issue. Over all these are great. The price, the feel and the idea. I gave it three stars because I couldn't hold the connection issue against it too much as I knew that going in to it but still a major factor. These have great potential!	2015-08-05

It's a FPS made by the same people who made Halo with light MMO and RPG elements.<br /><br />I will say that the key age range for Destiny seems to be...23-35?

While I do not have the item listed in my Amazon History, I have already went through 3 (yes, THREE!) of these displays.<br />The first was purchased from Best Buy. That display broke within 2 weeks.<br />The problem was that when the power button was pressed, the Power LED will blink a few times, and refuse to turn on the display.<br />Searching online, it seemed this was some Power Supply issue. So I presumed it was a Power Surge.<br />I went back to Best Buy and purchased a second one. This time, I plugged it to a Surge Protector.<br />However, after two months, the display exhibited the same issue again!<br />Know that the Surge Protector was still healthy, and I had multiple devices plugged into it (some turned on 24/7!), and none of those broke.<br />Thus, the issue is not a Power Surge.<br />So, I contacted Sony and they offered the repair it. I believe the one they sent back is a refurbished one, though (different Serial Number).<br />You know the story by now. Within a short amount of time, that replacement had the same issue again.<br /><br />So what's the conclusion?<br />Either it's extremely poor quality control, extremely bad design, or both.<br /><br />Do NOT buy this display.<br />Think about it, what advantages does it even have?<br />Simulview? Yes, it's a cool technology. But to be honest, it's not that useful. Further, not many games support it.<br />What about the 3D? Well, there are other options. The 3D-Glasses are quite shaded, and it makes the image too dark. There are better options.<br /><br />Again, I went through 3 of these displays, 2 from different physical stores (but of the same franchise), and 1 from Sony themselves.<br />All three broke down within a few months.	2015-08-05

For the price this portable screen is great. I read alot of reviews on this. Most people seem to complain about the viewing angles and the picture. Ok your not buying a 4k tv here. Its only $169. The viewing angles are not that bad. I definitely would recommend this for someone who travels alot like myself. I use this in the van sometimes. But if your buying this to use at home just buy a small tv or monitor. It has no speakers but i use my headset most of the time anyway.	2015-08-05

I'm glad I held off on getting a Playstation 4 to get this system. I'm a huge Batman fan and this edition was a must-have in my book. It was well worth the wait and the money. The system is well made and the game is awesome. I found myself using a lot of the entertainment apps, such as YouTube and Netflix. I can also operate both apps using my Android tablet, which is extremely helpful while searching for something to watch. I feel like a wasted money upgrading to a cable box in my room because now I use the PS4 much more. A small drawback in my opinion, is that the PS Store can be a bit slow from time to time.<br />As for the game, the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is very fluid. The only gripe I have for the game is that the Batmobile is utilized a little too much. I also encountered a glitch during a Riddler race where the Batmobile went through the floor and I had to restart from a save point, this however was a minor inconvenience. The story is pretty good but if you know a little about the Batman franchise, it's easy to guess who the Arkham Knight is.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of Batman.	2015-08-05

My entire ear fits in them which is cool because I've got big ears. Sound quality is pretty good, except there's not a big booty bass feeling on my head like my buddies headset, which is fine because too much vibration gives me a headache. Chord is super long, I appreciate that as I can freely explore my room while listening to jams. The mic works good, it's always nice to have a headset with a mic. The foam on the ear pieces is a little stiff which kinda makes my ears sore, either that or I listen to stuff too loudly. Anyway, I've been very happy with these bad boys and I'm really not looking to get anything else any time soon.	2015-08-05

The tank moves very very very very SLOW, the fireing and the cannon is also very very very SLOW. The good thing is that it moves very smooth, the tank now have their own sounds and it has more details, each level you are required to have a specific tank but not in the Mission mode, you also get to have 2 wingman this time that u can guide them through the battlefield.  The controls are the same as the the 1st Tank Beat, but for the Cannon you can choose how far u want it to range.  The levels are very slow to complete it takes a longer time to fire a cannon across the screen.  There are sooooo many tanks in this one unlike the Tank Beat I still cannot find how to get the laser tank.  But I hope there's a laser tank in this game.  Anyway this is a Tank Simulator mostly it's very tough to beat and I'll rate it 4/5. ☆☆☆☆	2015-08-05

But that's because Fallout 3 was such an amazing experience that fallout the series is now held up to ridiculously high standards.<br /><br />Fantastic game. However it always felt (and still does years later) like a really big DLC download that they should never have charged $ 60 for initially. The game was basically fallout 3 with a few tweaks that could have easily been implemented via patches to Fallout 3.<br /><br />Aiming down the sights was great and much needed, making the gun fighting better and more FPS like. Being able to mod your guns was also a welcomed change.<br /><br />The story line never felt as epic as Fallout 3's. It's ok but no where on the level of FO3.<br /><br />I felt that the game could have given you more missions as a legionnaire. And speaking of factions, the game instead of focusing on karma like in FO3 focuses more on which factions you're friends with. So you could be a huge thieving, cannibalizing dirt bag with low karma but the NCR troops will be friendly towards you and say hi because you've attacked Ceaser's Legion. A silly oversight.<br /><br />As for the DLC for this game, the Dead Money DLC is god awful. There's a mist that permeates large portions of the level and it automatically kills you. There's lots of other things that kill you and some holograms that are invincible. So no matter your level or skill, you'll be dying a lot the first time you go through it. I did and it was very frustrating. The worst is at the end....it's such a tease.<br /><br />The other DLCS:<br />Honest Hearts- Not bad, no real interesting items, armor, outfits added<br />Old World Blues- Rather fun DLC, new interesting weapons, new perks, funny dialogue. This was probably by favorite DLC of the bunch. There's also a lot of upgrades and perks you can earn through this.<br />Lonesome Road- My second favorite of the DLC. Lots of new weapons and armor in this one. The story was a bit weak and a let down to me based on the build up and mystery of who the other courier was and his whole story etc.<br /><br />Base game, plus 4 DLC packs and a greatest hits discount?  If you've never played this game get it.  It's hundreds of hours of entertainment for a super low cost.<br />I can't wait for Fallout 4.e of the DLC. Lots of new weapons and armor in this one. The story was a bit weak and a let down to me based on the build up and mystery of who the other courier was and his whole story etc.<br /><br />Base game, plus 4 DLC packs and a greatest hits discount?

They really should make the PS4 with more than just two USB ports. Being that they don't, I was on the look out for a hub that I could attach to it, as I do have games that take ports, and I have to charge my controllers most of the time, as my son's don't bother to tell anyone that they are dead until you go to grab them. It comes with 1 3.0 USB port, and 4 2.0 USB ports. This is awesome. So far, I haven't had any issues with it, all 5 ports are working well. I also liked how easy it hooked up. I did receive this USB Hub for PS4 at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-05

Video Games	5	11	13	N	Y	Support second to none	First off, this is an excellent controller!  I bought it for Battlefield 4, Hardline and Destiny.  It worked great and as described!  This is a super simple on/off configuration and works great on the zoom & fire buttons. You can easily switch it on/off within a second when you have a weapon that needs to charge like a fusion rifle in Destiny and pop it back on for your scout or pulse rifles.  The controller buttons cannot be remapped but you can remap the buttons in most game settings menu so it's no issue<br />This controller is worth the money and the best most unexpected feature is the support.  The support is the best in the business hands down! I had a problem with my controller a little after after 3 months...  It started firing without me touching it.  Most companies would have said , &#34;Sorry... Out of warranty period.&#34;  Not these guys.  I contacted Blackzone support and within a week they had replaced my controller and reaffirmed my decision to buy Blackzone vs the other guys out there.  They literally saved me from buying another controller or paying to have this one repaired and I guarantee you that I would have found another mod company to buy from but these guys stood behind their product and surprised the hell out of me!  They have my business for life thanks to the way they handled my problem!<br />Thank you again Blackzone!	2015-08-05

Great game, but not for the long haul. The game is awesome for the first 40 hours. Addicting game play, horrible story, but really cute and witty. The issue is after complete the story and DLC, there is really no purpose to continue your grinding for higher ranks unless you just want to do it for fun. You will be able to kill bigger bosses but there is no reward system in place that gives you satisfaction for you having done it. Get this game for 40 hours of fun, to play multiplayer with friends, or play it for 80 hours and realize that the last 40 hours you played you were just lying to yourself saying you were having fun. It like animal crossing, you have so much fun, but then you realize the hard work you have done, and you have a cool house, but then..... then what? Show our friends? Its not enough to motivate you to continue.  This is not a zelda, animal crossing, harvest moon, rune factory game. It does not have puzzles or clever combat like zelda. It is not like AC, it has Minimal house building with next to no character bonding or true com player interaction besides scripted dialog. It is not HM as in you build a farm and raise animals. The game play if finishing quests (hunt 3 of this animal or craft one of these things) and advancing the storyline that is almost entire separate from the gameplay quest. Meaning you can complete the story without doing any of the leveling quests. So quit thinking its like all these games.	2015-08-05

The item itself is without fault...the detailing is gorgeous and it works well. The photos are very true to the actual figure. However, it was intended to also be stored in the original case when not in use, which is our preference, and it arrived with the plastic cover dented rather badly. The figure itself wasn't damaged, but it was a close thing. It wasn't very securely packaged, which I assume was the cause. This would be an even bigger concern if one was planning to purchase it as a collectible.	2015-08-05

The story mode was so much better than 2. The animation for it was done in such a way it felt more like an anime than the 2 which kind of had them talk and didn't have such dramatic screenshots and stuff. It was like watching the abridged version of Naruto, and it was touching.<br /><br />I also like the fact I could switch to the Japanese voices which, in my opinion, sounds better and fits the characters better than their English counterparts.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the lack of freedom you have running around while the story line is going on. You are pretty much forced to stay in certain areas and most of the time the free roam is to go three screens before back to story. It makes sense given that your in a middle of a war and time is technically of the essence and you can't go wondering about, but it was still depressing. I also didn't like that you had a limit to how many times you could use a substitution jutsu before recharging. I guess that keep you and the computer from using it all the time, but it got real annoying when I'm fighting a tough opponent and use them all up very quickly.<br /><br />Overall, the story line is close to the anime, minus the things they changed at the end cause the anime hadn't gotten far past that, and it was done beautifully. I enjoyed it and had fun, but if you're not a Naruto fan, you probably won't enjoy it as much as someone who does.	2015-08-05

The game is basically broken thanks to terrible gameplay mechanics that will have you running into walls, getting stuck on windows, jumping where you don't want to go and thats just the parkour.

My personal fave is the &#34;Oh no, I'm getting shot but I can't see from where so  can't dodge (not like the dodge button works anyway) and I'm dead in 2 hits&#34;.

So Id like it more if you didnt have to download the Masterchief Collection. I get 130 Mb/s download on my PC but on Xbox it seems to cap itself. So it took close to 14 hours to fully download. Be prepared for long downloads. I dont know if im the only one, but the Master Chief collection seems to freeze up every now and then. The Xbox continues to work but I think as long you dont window the game youre ok. Also the controller doesnt come with rechargeables so youll need to buy your own for sure.	2015-08-05

Rest mode works fine for me while downloads are going. Basically as long as the hdd is active. I'm using the 4tb sshd. No issues with disk based games.<br /><br />Those having a hard time with this thing, check your connections. Make sure they're secure and we'll connected. Had an issue at first because I didn't have the hard drive perfectly connected.<br /><br />Suggestion for future possible product revision, have the entire top slide off, not just the front. And treat the hdd bay as a hdd holder. Ie require at least 2 screws to be screwed in to properly mount the 3.5 hdd. And add heat vents on the top or back.	2015-08-05

They do feel a kind of cheap when you hold them and seem breakable pretty easily. However the sound quality is pretty good and the bass boost works nice and doesn't distort the sound of everything else. The detachable mic is pretty useful since I watch a lot of Netflix and I can easily use the headphones for that. Overall these headphones are good but there's definitely better options if you up your price a bit, and they may be worth it since these are a bit flimsy. Oh and the mic monitoring function is fantastic	2015-08-05

Many disparage its console graphics, specifically the textures when viewed close-up. Consider instead the developers' intent which is to &#34;surprise&#34; the player with sprawling landscapes after fighting their way through a dim, dank dungeon (included screenshot is literal example of this). Look to the distance and this game becomes filled with unparalleled vistas, not to mention the thousands of quest-related locations made by man (and mer).

Instead of programming decent AI, the developers cheat for the computer. For instance, the enemies can use 5 ultimate dodges in a row. This requires 15 full bars of stamina, something they cannot possess. They then use 4 Ultimate attacks in a row, requiring 12 bars of Ki, something they cannot get without attacking normally first. Poor design means you just sit and grind until you are so over leveled that the cheating doesn't matter.	2015-08-05

Terrific device for streaming 4k video as well as using other Android apps. Also a great gaming platform.<br /><br />My only complaint is a more general complaint regarding HDCP 2.2 and it's lack of compatibility with 4k TV's built prior to 2015. This was a move that was intended to protect content, but ultimately only upset consumers that had invested thousands of dollars on TV's that can't be used as 4k displays due to this late change in content management. This device will only stream Netflix 4k content at HDCP 2.2 so if your 4k TV only supports HDCP 1.4 you are out of luck. This is typically a hardware upgrade and can't be managed via firmware. In my case, my Panasonic TV offers no solution to this problem.	2015-08-05

Sometimes, the interesting part of seeing a video game based on a film is that the developers get to have a chance to interpret the movie's story either in a playable manner or in a way that adds additional artistic cues onto what's already set up. Madagascar for the Playstation 2, for example, mainly follows the same storyline the animated film constructed, but at the same time, there are scenes that feature a zebra fighting strange crocodiles, a hippo overdosing on wild chili peppers, a giraffe scaling an old tree that needs to be saved, and a lion taking on the Foosa Leader. Oh yeah - TOTALLY like the movie!<br /><br />Joking aside, this game allows you to alternatively control zoo animals Marty (the zebra), Alex (the lion), Gloria (the hippo), Melman (the giraffe), and Skipper (the leader of four penguins). The quest revolves around Marty's desires to head off to the wild, what went on during the four friends' escapades at the island of Madagascar, and Alex's psychological need for &#34;steak&#34;.<br /><br />While quite a few movie-based games at the time would utilize footage directly from the films as cutscenes, Madagascar actually decides using its in-game assets for such. The resulting presentation isn't the best, but it works; there are at least a few jokes and gags unique to the game, and the graphics are generally pretty good. The voice acting is also usually up to par, as the substitute actors do a decent job of replicating the movie stars' voice chops, except for King Julien's (lemur leader) actor; he delivers a lousy accent and his lines give Julien a generic native leader personality instead of being that comical dancing cloudcuckoolander we saw in the movie. Also noteworthy is probably Private's (one of the penguins) no-nonsense attitude when you take control of Skipper; I was a bit put off at first, but I've since found it interesting.<br /><br />As for the gameplay, Madagascar tends to change its mechanics around at various points in the game's 11 levels, but it primarily takes the style of a 3D platformer. You don't get to switch between the characters much, but each of them provides his/her own skills to the table from Alex's double jumping to Gloria's ability to run fast via chili peppers to Marty's leg kicks. I wish there more opportunities for me to just play through a level without a required side-mission or few added on, but as is, I don't mind it too much since they don't really annoy me. Some of the gimmicks utilized in many of the missions come off as arcade-like, but I suppose they get the job done.<br /><br />The game plays the difficulty rather safely, considering I've beaten the game without getting to see the Game Over screen. However, while the game isn't perfect in more ways than just its easiness, I did enjoy playing Madagascar, and I recommend this title to fans of the movie, those willing to have some platforming cravings satisfied, or both. You might just like what you find here, too.levels, but it primarily takes the style of a 3D platformer.

I love that each story opens up with a scene from the anime. It gives an overall story, but mostly just sticks to the fights, but still allows you to have an overall idea of what happened in the universe. They are short as you play through each characters story line. As this game is supposed to be more about the generations of Naruto fighting each other, I found this acceptable even though in Ultimate Ninja Storm I would not have appreciated it as it is supposed to be more about the story. What I dislike about it. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BLOOD!! If you watch the anime (and I'm not talking about that Cartoon Network and Disney versions that came out that edited so much it became depressing and uninteresting), you know there is blood. They are ninjas. People get stabbed. You have no idea how confusing a fight is if there is no blood. You can't tell if an attacked missed or connected and how much damage there really is. I only played through four story lines, and while I an excuse the gameplay itself not showing blood, I cannot excuse actual clips from the anime (Zabuza's last stand) to be edited. Watching the last stand from Zabuza's fight had be confused on who actually was injured or if he even really attacked them. As I watched the Japanese version of the anime, I knew how it was supposed to be. Since this was made in Japan and kept the Japanese voices, I don't see why they didn't keep the unedited clips. This really irked me, and it lessened the excitement of having real clips in the game.<br /><br />I haven't played much outside the storyline yet, but I did play some of the tournament stuff. Let me tell you, having sage mode Naruto beat up 12 year old Naruto who is pretty much useless and lacks any skill besides kage bushin no jutsu and rasengan is very very satisfying. In fact having him beat up all of team seven without them landing a single It reminded me of the second chuunin exams when Naruto beat up Konohamaru. I did the same thing with Kazekage Gaara fighting his younger self and siblings. Now this is probably just a me thing, but in a match between Sakura and Sasuke, in what world does Sasuke lose to Sakura  (especially when they are children)? I know that it's supposed to be randomly selected so that tournaments have some variety for the player, but come on! That's like saying that TenTen can actually beat someone in the Naruto universe. You can't allow her to have that hope! She's the most useless character in the show, and she beats Neji in the tournament? Like I said that is mostly just me and being a fan of the series, knowing their weakness, strengths, and memorizing the databooks, but it does detract a bit from the tournaments for me though it wouldn't for most.<br /><br />As a straight up fighting game, it isn't bad. I'm not really into fighting games, but I do love ナルト and I find nostalgia and satisfaction beating characters I don't like or playing characters I love. A fan would probably love it, a non fan, probably not so much. I enjoyed it despite my complaints, and those who has only seen the edited version or stuck to the American version will probably not find any detraction from it.It reminded me of the second chuunin exams when Naruto beat up Konohamaru.

It's the Beatles, what's not to love?  It's too bad that they stopped supporting the game with DLC.  If you love singing Beatles songs in karaoke, then pick up this game.  It's a ton of fun.

Game has a great selection of songs spanning all their career.<br /><br />Game has great artistic style and they put a lot of love into the product, it's very evident.

These are the sticks that I have owned:<br />- Hori Soul Calibur IV Fightstick PS3<br />- Hori Real Arcade Pro PS3<br />- Mad Catz Marvel vs Capcom 2 Tournament Stick<br />- Hori Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 Arcade Stick<br /><br />Out of these sticks, I liked the Hori Real Arcade Pro stick the best because I modified it using Sanwa buttons, a Seimitsu spring, a octagon gate, and a bat tip (which I reverted back to ball tip).  The second controller would be the Hori Ultimate Marvel because it still included the Sanwa buttons.  The Mad Catz controller just clunked out on me so I can't say much about this stick.  I been to Evo 2k10 and I was able to do pretty well with my best stick so I do have a great deal of experience with joysticks<br /><br />The number one issue I have always had with all of these sticks was the clicking of the microswitches when you move the joystick.  In my youth, joysticks never clicked, it just has a cheap feel to me.  I kind of accepted that microswitches was the in thing of today for joysticks and this is where the Hayabusa controller came in.<br /><br />Before buying this stick, I was on the fence of first deciding to buy a new stick altogether, and if I did, which one would be the stick to get.  I was comparing the Hori Kai, Hori Hayabusa, and the Mad Katz PS4 stick.  Mad Katz sticks with the Sanwa buttons I am accustomed to but Hori decides to do something different by developing their own buttons called &#34;kuro&#34;.  I went to various forums trying to see how people viewed these new buttons and I understand that Sanwa and Seimitsu has been the button of choice for many years without any real reason to improve them.  Hori did some work to try to develop a new button and this has been added into this controller.  I came across some reviews however of people saying that the buttons squeaks if not pressed in the direct center of the button so I was nervous about this.  So while deciding and comparing, I accidently stumbled on this version called the Hayabusa Silent.<br /><br />What this controller does is add extra parts to the buttons to make the buttons completely silent.  But the game changer for me as I was mentioning earlier was the joystick itself.  This joystick is a completely different design on the inside from the other Hori and Mad Katz controllers as it uses a optical joystick.  That means there is no clicking involved at all in this joystick.  Amazingly, I felt very comfortable with the square gate installed in this also.  I did some rounds playing KoF using Omega Rugal and I was able to consistently do all of this combos.  This controller felt more natural than even my original best controller.  It didn't feel as loose to me as my Hori Ultimate Marvel stick which I never modified.  It bought me back to the days of when I use to play in the original arcades.<br /><br />The buttons also felt very good.  It was a little stiffer than the Sanwa but I liked it like this.  I read that the kuro buttons are supposed to be 60% more durable than Sanwa so I'm hoping this be true.  In my original Hori, my jab Sanwa button lost some of it's responsiveness playing Street Fighter IV so I often lose to tech throws so hopefully this will be durable for Street Fighter V as they claim.  Also, these buttons are also completely silent.  I could be playing at night and nothing at all could be heard unless I of course hit the buttons hard, but that's the sound of my hand hitting any object.  This is perfect for couples if a person is trying to sleep while the other person uses headphones.<br /><br />I was thinking about being a pad player in the PS4 generation, but this completely changes my position of even testing that theory.  I'm happy with my purchase and hope Hori continue to stay a quality company.	2015-08-05

However, for those unfamiliar with it, playing TNO isn't mandatory since it's a prequel.<br /><br />The game is a FPS, that takes place during WWII along an alternate timeline, where the Nazis have perfected robotics, cybernetics and weapon-tech. Meaning you will find yourself battling robotic super soldiers, cyborgs and well equipped soldiers eager to tear your head off.<br /><br />While the game is a FPS, it does have many stealth elements. Sure, you can run in guns blazing and possibly survive. However the safer, and in my opinion way more fulfilling route, is stealthing your way through certain locations. Why blast a heavily armored super soldier when you can sneak through some air ducts and get behind him to shut off his power? Why run through a kennel and battle cyborg dogs when you can sneak up to them while they sleep and silence them quickly?<br /><br />No matter which route you go, if you are a fan of W:TNO, or FPS games in general you will probably love this game. It's not without it's faults though which I will list below, but first allow me to tell you what it does well.<br /><br />-Pros-<br />Incredibly long for a 20 dollar game<br />Breathtaking graphics<br />Excellent voice acting<br />Fantastic Storyline<br />Vent Crawling!<br />Good variety of enemies<br />Challenging gameplay with adjustable difficulty levels<br /><br />-Cons-<br />No Multi-player<br />Inadequate Tutorial<br />Not much replay value.<br />Occasionally the AI can be a bit dimwitted<br />No manual save	2015-08-05

But when I viewed LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, I saw nothing but 4 or 5 star reviews, compared to the 1 to 3 star reviews for most others. I went with my gut and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />In terms of graphics, it is mostly moderate, with the HD mostly taking up the cutscenes (of which you get most of the humor), but in terms of gameplay, it couldn't be better for a game like this. You mostly experience what you would get in a console version (I don't have the console version because I don't have a console as of yet for this game), and this time, the characters talk in-game at times, of which the rest of the humor is placed in.<br /><br />As with all LEGO games, there is a lot of replay value, but the Trophy System in the Vita gives it even more replay value. I'm already almost at 50% in collecting all the trophies, with many more calling my name. And, we finally see Batman and the Justice League In SPACE.<br /><br />All in all, a great alternative to most of the other LEGO games, because the graphics are better, the gameplay is better, and the humor is just as good as the console versions as other games. 5/5.	2015-08-05

It would make an excellent teaching aid if you've never played guitar before.  It's fun to have a long jam session to or just rock out for a song or two.  I wasn't aware that you could import the songs from Rocksmith 1 until recently.  I just imported it and I have a pretty huge song list to choose from and have fun with.  I wish they'd add more (insert so many band names) but I'm happy with what I have so far and they regularly add stuff.<br /><br />Rocksmith is the reason I probably won't be getting Rock Band 4 (until it drops to $ 20) as after playing my real guitar to songs I like, I can't go back to the 5 plastic button garbage guitar games.

As most of us know, US Vita support will most likely end this year (2015), so you should start getting used to playing imports anyway if you plan on playing your Vita past New Years.<br />With all that said, God Eater was probably my favorite PSP title, and the sequel improves on the original... more to customize and build up, as in the first, the story is secondary to the action so you can easily play through w no knowledge of Japanese at all. However it doesn't take much searching to find postings about the plot online, so you won't miss much.<br />Also, there is no lock on international software for the Vita, so everyone's American systems will play imports w no trouble. Only issue is not having access to all DLC, which can b disappointing, but fortunately, for this title, the developers made an the latest update available via website, which does install some of the DLC.<br />...In the end, whether you're new to the series or not, if you enjoy games like Freedom Wars (which borrowed a LOT from God Eater), or Monster Hunter, you'll most likely have your head buried in this one for weeks.	2015-08-05

The base game is enjoyable for a bit, but that fades quickly if you've ever played the sims 3 or the sims 2. Given the long list of game limitations such as: lack of an open world (only one lot and a small neighborhood common area loaded a time), restriction of babies to mere objects attached to cribs, lack of a toddler life stage, sims teleporting to different lots instead of actually walking/driving to the edge of the screen, lack of traditional careers, focus on cartoon cupcake makers and telescopes instead of real telescopes like in previous games, and lack of terrain editing tools, this game just breaks the level of immersion that the previous titles had for players. Every time you get caught into the game play, it's broken by either a loading screen, or a cartoon depiction of something that should have been lifelike.<br /><br />Now, the game isn't without it's improvements. The multitasking system is awesome and allows for sims to take better advantage of their time, the new CAS and sims graphics allows you to create more life-like sims once you get the hang of it, and the new build/buy mode also shows some improvements in easier house making. But overall, for long-time players of The Sims series, this game will likely come as a disappointment to you. I have reverting back to playing the Sims 3 now.<br /><br />EA has released several updates and patches over the past year to add things like pools (but the diving board is still MIA), and stuff packs, game packs, and expansion packs, but none have significantly changed the underlying problems with this game. I believe a better title for this release would be The Sims 1.5. It is a game that could have been built 10 years ago, and probably runs fine on computers made 10 years ago. In conclusion, I recommend waiting to see if they can fix some of the issues with the game, or wait it out until The Sims 5 (if that even happens)...don't waste your money here.conclusion, I recommend waiting to see if they can fix some of the issues with the game, or wait it out until The Sims 5 (if that even happens)...don't waste your money here.	2015-08-05

I didn't have any dislikes about the game because the way it runs and the story are not that bad at all. We all know that usually these underrated RPG's are not played for the story but this one is different. I would play this game just for the story alone. The graphics are not bad for it being a pretty dated title reason being it has anime style graphics and there really isn't much room to fail. If you love the old FF series buy this game I am sure you will not be dissapointed!	2015-08-05

US	43645771	R2ABJ8D5XF73O0	B0087OZ5FG	665481304	Pulse Elite Edition Wireless Stereo Headset	Video Games	2	0	1	N	Y	DO NOT BUY (Cracks, Heavy, and Buzzes)	I used to have this as a 5 Star.  Here are the very evident problems that far out weight any positives of the headset.  It should also be noted that I am a 14 year old using my family's account, so I don't have money to throw at $500 Turtle Beaches that last forever or a replacement.  I hoped that this would be a high quality headset that I could use on the computer, or the PS3 for a very long time (I was hoping at least 3 years).  Because I would like to remain somewhat positive (although at this point how can I?) I will start with the short list of positives.  Positives:  Microphone Sound Cancelling:  I play about 3 feet away from a speaker for the TV, as I sit in the corner.  When I ask people if they hear anything in the background, they say &#34;No&#34; even though I can clearly hear the sound through the headset.  This bit here is for sure a 5 Star.  Sound Options:  I can't tell huge differences in sound, so it usually doesn't affect me.  However, I must say the options are quite nice.  You can change the bass to create vibrations when an explosion or a car crash happens.  I personally didn't use this as it gave me a massive head ache when I tried it, but it is there.  You can also change the Voice Chat and Game Sound, but on the same slider.  You can also change the Game Type, from &#34;Game&#34; to &#34;Racer&#34; to &#34;Shooter&#34; and &#34;Movie&#34; however this is quite useless and I just left it on &#34;Game&#34; the entire time.  There is also Virtual Surround Sound (VSS) that I really liked.  I turned it off to figure out what games sounded like without VSS, and I was shocked.  This feature is great!  I cannot describe how awesome this VSS is.  The sliders and buttons on the headset are quite nice, but I could see them becoming a little broken easily.  That's it.  Nothing else is good.  Negatives  Comfort: While I did say that nothing else is good, the bit around the ear feels nice and comfortable.  The weight of the headset is crazy though, and topdoesn't help.  The top is thin, and not very thick.  This creates EXTREME discomfort.  This is one major deal breaker.  Durability: This is, again, TERRIBLE.  Let me attempt to describe where this headset CRACKED and started to creak whenever I moved at all.  The silver circles on the side of the headset I think are rumble devices for the bass.  Just below that, there is a thin &#34;bridge&#34; and then the shiny plate that says &#34;Wireless Stereo Headset&#34;.  The bridge cracked on the silver side of the bridge, on both sides.  My dad got some homemade plastic that we smeared all over the bridge, and that has prevented the cracking from expanding and stopped the creaking.  This is unacceptable.  My headset should not be breaking in this manor, close enough to almost being completely broken.  Charging while playing: This issue was the straw that broke the camel's back.  The headset has terrible battery life, roughly 4-5 hours, which means charging is frequent.  Yes, you can charge and play, but recently my headset has been buzzing while being plugged in.  Pushing the end against the side of the charging port on the headset stops the buzzing, but I don't need to have homemade plastic on both sides and some tape on the headset, as the risk of taping the microphone shut is really high if I do that.  Overall, DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET.  I know that my replacement will be Turtle Beach Stealth 400 as those are cheaper (checked before I wrote this, $78), lighter, better sound/mic quality, and overall just better than this headset.  Unfortunately for me, I need to find a $100 bill in the parking lot, or wait for Christmas.	2015-08-05

It arrived fast and was packaged safely for delivery.  When I opened the box it was so sleek and about 5 inches high and the base is 6&#34;×4&#34;. The size is perfect to sit close to your game Playstation and not take to much room.  It is a sharp black plastic with clear trim that looks great and very sturdy.  It comes with a USB cable and hi-capacity AC adapter.  The unit has two holders for controllers and expands to charge two more on the side through two ports.  The charger has a light that alerts you of charging (red) and fully charged (green).  The bottom of the base is covered with a non-slip pad. Our controllers fully charged in about 3 hours and I cannot tell you about four because we only have two.  The included USB can be plugged into the AC adapter or into the Playstation to charge you controllers.  That is great when short on plugs!<br />We have had our charger a few days and it has worked perfectly!  It holds the controllers firmly, it does not slide around when using it, charges fast, and does all this while still looking great.  You will love this charger and it is a good deal for how good the quality is.  I highly recommend this for yourself or for any gamer as a gift.  It would make any parent the &#34;cool&#34; parent gifting this to their kids!<br />**Disclaimer-I received this product free or for a deeply discounted price for a honest and unbiased review.

Fun mechanics, good story, and wide range of levels.  Very enjoyable game.	Sniper Elite 3 was is a really fun game.  It wasn't very long which was a shame but while I was playing it, I loved it.<br /><br />My friend and I both purchased a copy so we play the campaign cooperatively.  It was really awesome.  I liked you could work together to cover each other and provide support.  There was enough stealth and shooting to not disappoint.  When you made a really awesome shot, the game would go into slow motion and follow the bullet which was unexpected the first time it happened but a very cool pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The levels were all very different and it never felt like we were just out to go shoot people.  The story is actually pretty good.  There aren't a ton of different weapons to use but enough that it kept you busy and working toward that next upgrade.  The mechanics of the game were really good as well.  When zoomed in for a shot you can hold your breath to steady your shot, otherwise the scope would move slightly.  You also have a fair amount of running and gunning.  It really is up to you how you want to proceed through the level.  There are definitely certain ways that the creators thought you should go through the level...killing certain people in certain places to get through without anyone noticing but more often than not, my friend and I would screw that up, get noticed and then we were in a fire fight.<br /><br />Overall, I wish it was a longer game but it was cheap and free to play online with my friend.  Definitely worth it because it was really fun and did not disappoint.	2015-08-05

But alas my batteries kept dying while I was in epic unyielding combat. After spending hundreds of dollars on batteries to quench my undying thirst for pixelated blood I finally decided to go out and get a play and charge kit so I could afford to eat more then just ramen warmed up with tap water while on week long tweaked out gaming sprees in my Uncles basement. But just as it seemed that my addiction for animated gore-porn would be sated my new rechargeable batteries died... But its alright, right? Because you can just recharge them? Sure you can, then they die again after an even shorter period of time. I finally just gave up and attempted to strange myself with the charging cord, but it broke so that didn't work either.<br /><br />In summation, the charging part of this apparatus works just fine. The rechargeable batteries provided with it however were not genuine XBOX goodies, but some knock off brand junk that has a half-life of about a week. After being charged 4-5 times they no longer hold a charge long enough to even turn on the box.	2015-08-05

It's very energy efficient. Once the controls are charged, the device powers off. Quick charge time as well. I never have a dead control. Efficient product. I love this thing. Charges my PS4 controllers much faster than the wire through the system.  Used to be I would be playing and my controller would always start to die because i wouldn't plug it in.

This &#34;perfect fit&#34; situation has become very annoying as well. Everyone i go to charge my controller i have to wiggle and play with the controller to make sure the charge light actually comes on and stays on because sometimes it will come on for like 2 seconds and then turn right back off.<br /><br />i am already in the market for buying a new charger. This was a very big disappointment. By @ at your own risk!	2015-08-05

It was also my first and I instantly fell in love with this game.  I'd never even heard of the battlefield franchise before (never having been a PC gamer) and so when I tried the beta I had no idea what I was about to try.  The beta was just one level repeated over and over.  The weekend I played the beta, someone had lent me Cod Modern Warfare 2...and I found myself playing the beta over a full retail Cod game.  It was just that good.<br /><br />When the full retail game came out I played the hell out of it.  The game was perfect.  The gun fights were great, the vehicle combat was fantastic.  There were so many epic moments when playing this game.  I moved onto Battlefield 3 when it came out but I preferred Bad Company 2.  I eagerly await for them to make a Bad Company 3.  I don't know exactly what about Bad Company 2 made it to me so much more enjoyable than Battlefield 3.  But it was.<br /><br />Maybe it was the destructible environments that you never got in Battlefield 3.  Or the fact that they added maps for free instead of nickle and diming you with DLC expansions and a &#34;premium&#34; gimmick.<br /><br />Here's hoping for a Bad Company 3 soon as I passed on both Battlefield 4 and Hardline.	2015-08-05

A classic example of cheaply made shovelware, clearly not play-tested or created with any care or thought for quality. The controls are clunky and don't work properly; the dialog reads like an unedited first draft of a bad translation from another language; and the gameplay is primarily a few extremely simplistic mini-games that have nothing to do with fashion or creativity whatsoever. The only part of the game that actually has anything to do with fashion is dressing up your avatar, however the interface is so poorly designed and the animation so laughably awful that even picking out clothes fails to be fun. The mini-games are so repetitive, simplistic and uncreative I can't imagine anyone over the age of six being entertained for more than five minutes.  Do not waste your money on this so-called &#34;game&#34;.  If you want an actual fashion game for the 3DS, pick up Style Savvy Fashion Trendsetters. It costs more, but is worth every penny. This one was a scam at thirteen dollars.	2015-08-05

Only drawback for me, is I played the crap out of Far Cry 3, and unfortunately Ubisoft and their partners have done it again, which is take a formula that just works and expands on it only slightly. I've only seen one 2 new mechanics that they've added, which is the lure and the rock climbing/rope swinging. Guns are pretty much the same, some tweaks here and there for the stealth mechanics, and slightly updated graphics. Also the snowy environments are a little refreshing, and the story is just as good.<br /><br />Overall, if you loved Far Cry 3, and you absolutely need to play more of it with a new story, pick this up. No regrets.	2015-08-05

This device is a pretty spot on 1to1 replica of the real thing, however the problem lies in the joystick. The stick on this comptroller is nothing like the stick of the classic N64 controller as there doesn't seem to be a &#34;deadzone&#34; for the stick itself when calibrating. Using the stick is similar to using the d-pad as any direction you push it in will act as a 100% pitch, which isn't good if you're playing games that require precession. I'll just stick with playing on my Xbox 360 controller.	2015-08-05

Except they added in co-op...and let me tell you.  It makes a big difference when you play with a buddy.  Unfortunately you can't play the main storyline campaign missions co-op.  But you can do everything else (and there's a lot of it) co-op.  When I first played co-op with my room mate it made me focus only on the storyline so I could leave everything else open to do in co-op.  It's that fun.  Yesterday we did two of the fortresses and it was a blast.  I perched on a mountain overlooking the compound and provided sniper support while he went into the fortress to wreck havoc.  It's too bad what you do in co-op doesn't count if you joined someone else's game.  For example, if you join your friend's game and liberate a outpost that you haven't in your game, you don't get credit for it in your game.  You have to do it again on your file.  Even so, it's still fun.<br /><br />So, Far Cry 4 is a great experience but even more so if you do it in co-op.	2015-08-05

Let me preface this by saying I really loved playing Fallout New Vegas and this review will compare it to Fallout 3 a lot and make some complaints.  But that's because Fallout 3 was such an amazing experience that fallout the series is now held up to ridiculously high standards.<br /><br />Fantastic game.  However it always felt (and still does years later) like a really big DLC download that they should never have charged $ 60 for initially.  The game was basically fallout 3 with a few tweaks that could have easily been implemented via patches to Fallout 3.<br /><br />Aiming down the sights was great and much needed, making the gun fighting better and more FPS like. Being able to mod your guns was also a welcomed change.<br /><br />The story line never felt as epic as Fallout 3's.  It's ok but no where on the level of FO3.<br /><br />I felt that the game could have given you more missions as a legionnaire. And speaking of factions, the game instead of focusing on karma like in FO3 focuses more on which factions you're friends with.  So you could be a huge thieving, cannibalizing dirt bag with low karma but the NCR troops will be friendly towards you and say hi because you've attacked Ceaser's Legion.  A silly oversight.<br /><br />As for the DLC for this game, the Dead Money DLC is god awful.  There's a mist that permeates large portions of the level and it automatically kills you.  There's lots of other things that kill you and some holograms that are invincible.  So no matter your level or skill, you'll be dying a lot the first time you go through it.  I did and it was very frustrating.  The worst is at the end....it's such a tease.<br /><br />The other DLCS:<br />Honest Hearts- Not bad, no real interesting items, armor, outfits added<br />Old World Blues- Rather fun DLC, new interesting weapons, new perks, funny dialogue.  This was probably by favorite DLC of the bunch.  There's also a lot of upgrades and perks you can earn through this.<br />Lonesome Road- My second favorite of the DLC.  Lots of new weapons and armor in this one.  The story was a bit weak and a let down to me based on the build up and mystery of who the other courier was and his whole story etc.<br /><br />I can't wait for Fallout 4.econd favorite of the DLC.

After some disappointing purchases of Turtle Beaches in the past, I decided to try one more time for the perfect headset for my needs. I really did not want to spend 300+ dollars, so I decided to go middle ground with this headset. I have completed my first marathon gaming session and this 420x performed like a champ. As for the fit, the headset is very lightweight and comfortable, but the earpads were slightly stiff.  Let me get right to what I thought of the sound with respect to my needs. The sound is much better than my PX4's and is on par with my Kingston HyperX Cloud II's as far as clarity and overall sound field is concerned. I would not consider myself an audiophile, but I have quite a few headsets over 100+ dollars to compare with. The 420x's don't have surround sound, this is stereo sound, but it is done with great balance throughout the sound field. Also the sound was great outside of Xbox One, I am listening to Spotify on my PS4 with my 420x's while I write this. Now onto my positive and negative points.<br /><br />PRO's<br />-Very lightweight<br />-Great battery<br />-No hissing or distortion<br />-Suprisingly good stereo sound (right amount of treble and bass, not overpowering).<br />-ability to control every aspect of chat, mute, volume, and audio presets on the headset.<br />-100% wireless<br />-four types of audio presets<br />-active mic monitoring<br />-outstanding chat clarity<br />-can achieve very high volume with little to no distortion<br />-Microsoft's play and charge usb cable will also charge this headset. That cable is about 8 feet long.<br />-can work with PS4 for audio with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable (not included). Chat also works, I chatted in a private party on my PS4.<br /><br />Secondly, now for the things I thought could be better or could be improved upon. I was concerned with the all plastic headband and frame. After asking many of the vine reviewers here on Amazon, none really answered the question of stability and if the headband was cheaply made. I reached out to Turtle Beach support and was reassured that the mistakes made with the Stealth 400 headset and the cracking headband for PS4 were not present in the 420x. I also felt that 158 dollars shipped isn't quite a great deal either, I feel that this is slightly a overpriced headset at this time.<br /><br />CON's<br />-build quality could be much better, far to much plastic<br />-not a versatile headset, I will discuss this in more detail below<br />-149.99 is much higher than Sony's offering of the Gold Wireless Headset (wireless and simulated 7.1 surround sound)  that is usually less than 99 dollars.<br />-not full noise cancellation<br />-mic monitoring is non-adjustable<br />-usb cable provided for charging is very short<br />-the overall headset headband is not flexible at all<br /><br />My list of cons is mostly things that are slightly nitpicking, but this headset is really terrific overall, I am surprised at how it performs. Also this headset did work with my PS4 as well, but could not be powered by the 3.5mm alone, it needs to be plugged into the DS4 and also needs to be powered on which is going to drain the battery, this headset was made primarily for Xbox One only. It also works well with mobile devices, but this isn't a headset I would pickup for PS4, so please take my advice and go with another solution for that. My big worry is the plastic headband, I will update this in a few months to discuss durability. Despite any cons I could find, I am still going with 5 stars because this headset does many things right and not many things wrong.

I reached out to Turtle Beach support and was reassured that the mistakes made with the Stealth 400 headset and the cracking headband for PS4 were not present in the 420x. I also felt that 158 dollars shipped isn't quite a great deal either, I feel that this is slightly a overpriced headset at this time.<br /><br />CON's<br />-build quality could be much better, far to much plastic<br />-not a versatile headset, I will discuss this in more detail below<br />-149.99 is much higher than Sony's offering of the Gold Wireless Headset (wireless and simulated 7.1 surround sound)  that is usually less than 99 dollars.<br />-not full noise cancellation<br />-mic monitoring is non-adjustable<br />-usb cable provided for charging is very short<br />-the overall headset headband is not flexible at all<br /><br />My list of cons is mostly things that are slightly nitpicking, but this headset is really terrific overall, I am surprised at how it performs. Also this headset did work with my PS4 as well, but could not be powered by the 3.5mm alone, it needs to be plugged into the DS4 and also needs to be powered on which is going to drain the battery, this headset was made primarily for Xbox One only. It also works well with mobile devices, but this isn't a headset I would pickup for PS4, so please take my advice and go with another solution for that. My big worry is the plastic headband, I will update this in a few months to discuss durability. Despite any cons I could find, I am still going with 5 stars because this headset does many things right and not many things wrong. I commend Turtle Beach for going in the right direction with the 420x.<br />Update:09/27<br />The durability seems to be good so far, nothing is showing cracks. I have replaced the stiff earpads with Brainwavz HM5 memory foam earpads and the comfort is really great now.	2015-08-05

I was using another brand shaped like an Intellimouse which is close to what I like. My problem is a smaller size mouse using a claw grip adds tension to my small finger and runs up my shoulder.

Its heavier with the added weights and fairly easy to tailor to my needs. Which is general computing, internet and games. It seems very well built for a reasonable price.	2015-08-05

This game should have been titled Borderlands: We get it the Moon is Australia!!!  2k Australia took an established franchise with a devoted following and decided to make the story horrible, remove anything humorous from it, and add &#34;upgrades&#34; that you can play the entire game without using and still be okay.  First off, the lack of humor.  Borderlands 2 was very funny.  This game, well, if I hear one more reference to a term they only use in Australia as far as slang I am going to murder myself.  Second, the &#34;upgrades&#34; aka butt slams and laser weapons, butt slams are almost entirely useless and laser weapons are fun but too little to save this pathetic title.  Character development is terrible.  All of the new character they introduced were awful particularly the character Pickle.  2k Australia said to themselves &#34;Hey Tiny Tina is popular lets make a character like her and people will love it&#34;.  They then proceeded to make a character that was not funny at all and that frankly I wanted to shoot in the face every time I had to deal with him.  Note to 2k Australia, if a joke is only funny on your continent then now one else will laugh.  I have never once thought to despise an entire continent for ruining something I like but thank you Australia, I can proudly say your continent sucks	2015-08-05

The only nice thing I can say about these controllers is they were on time and were packaged nicely. I bought two controllers and both of them are major disappointments. The first one I tried is unplayable. It either has a faulty joystick or it's just plain broken because Tony Hawk won't stop skating in circles. The second controller is playable although it does not recognize my rumble or controller packs. This is a great product if you like to gamble on how bad of a product you'll get. I'm just glad I spent $25 for two that lasted me until I bought 4 original controllers on craigslist.	2015-08-05

That's something I could only dream about when I was a kid. For the life of me, I do not understand why there are so few products on the market that fill this niche. Most of the PC controllers on Amazon have been around for almost a decade. This controller really is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The Good: Build quality - Everything from the packaging to the finish to the button feel is in line with what you get from Sony or Nintendo OEM products. Companies that make cheap junk simply do not invest the resources that it takes to get those things right.<br />Style - The edge lighting is a really cool touch, and you can't beat the retro NES look.<br />Travel friendly - It's thin and light, yet has the full button array of a console gamepad. It easily slips into a laptop bag or backpack, and the battery life is solid.<br />Wireless - I hate using wired controllers, and I'm not fond of using USB dongles either. This pairs with the Bluetooth that is already in your device.<br /><br />The Bad: The left analog stick does not snap back to center as it should.<br />There’s a learning curve to get the feel for the placement of the R1/R2 and L1/L2 buttons.<br /><br />The Ugly: Getting the Bluetooth to pair takes some trial and error. On more than 1 occasion, my controller had a catastrophic crash that left it unresponsive for hours. The manufacturer has been releasing frequent firmware updates since launching this model. Maybe they will eventually get these issues ironed out, but for now, I’m definitely deducting a star from my rating.	2015-08-05

Good and comfy for extended use for long gaming sessions and the mic is detachable so it is not in the way when not being used.<br /><br />Mic Quality - 8/10<br />-Good quality microphone that picks up noise very easy and sometimes a little to easy so make sure you watch your game volume when in use. Great that this thing is detachable so that when not in use it is out of the way. The background noise cancel is done very nicely and works awesome.<br /><br />Anymore questions about these just leave a comment and I will try my best to answer them for you.	2015-08-05

The game was fun for about 10 minutes until I realized I could hit a hole in one on every single hole or an albatross or eagle on every single par 5 or par 4 by just adusting the aim line into the hole.  Then, after playing it for 3 days, I decided to start playing online, and to make it more challenging, I turned the aim line off.  Well, when I did that, the game locked up.  Now it freezes every single time I go into the settings to try to change it back.  I contacted EA Sports about this.  Their solution was to delete everything off my xbox, gamertag, game, everything, and then reboot my internet.  So, In order to get their crappy game to work, I have to lose everything else on my xbox.  I just wrote this off as a $60 loss.  It really is a shame, because I've played the Tiger Woods franchise since it came out.  This is by far the worst effort I have ever seen.  I think the free game I got for ordering a whopper at Burger King where you got to drive the Burger King guy around was more entertaining than this.	2015-08-05

As a big fan of the series I found this game to offer a poor experience. The graphics felt tired and aged. The gameplay was stripped to the basics and found myself pressing the same 2 buttons constantly in every enemy encounter. I also felt disconnected from the world while walking around and having someones awful taste in music getting picked up from their mics and playing through my speakers.<br /><br />The game made me feel like a cookie cutter character rather than a unique entity in a world of bland missions that was too similar to World of Warcraft. I also disliked the new leveling system which made it evident I would have to rely on others for a particular specialty rather than being a jack of all trades like in Skyrim.<br /><br />If I wanted a WoW game then I would have bought a WoW game. I bought Elder Scrolls because I wanted Elder Scrolls.<br /><br />I happened to have purchased neither. It wasn't WoW and it wasn't Elder Scrolls. This is a game with no identity. It's no wonder they made it free to play (excluding game price), because even at free I found no pleasure in this tasteless title that is Elder Scrolls Online.<br /><br />In hindsight I would not have bought this game.	2015-08-05

The weight is perfect and it's super comfy, even if you're playing for long periods of time.  The thumb sticks are more slippery than I'd like though and seem like the material will eventually fall off.  I had to replace them with XB1 sticks on my first controller that I bought used and the XB1 sticks are far superior.

Game forces you to be fast paced in battles, and wants you to play through it more than once.  On EASY mode, my first playthrough, I was consistently running into enemies that were pretty high level, and often had quests that demanded my characters be high level - most recommended a second playthrough before attempting these optional battles.  To me these comprised of about half of the game, as I only did the bare minimum to get Platinum trophy.  Got bored grinding, which I did a couple of times, as the enemies didn't seem too vastly different.<br /><br />Can't freely explore as you need to unlock regions based on the chapter you're at.  Worst of all is the game's story was really dry, and except for missions, none of the additional tasks/NPC talks really added anything to the story or enjoyment of the game.  Pretty boring overall.  Buy it when it's in the bargain bin.	2015-08-05

The headset feels well built and is not to heavy in my opinion.<br />I did purchase this for my Xbox one and you do have to contact the company to get the controller puck and boom mic attachment.  I have used it on my Xbox 360 for audio and chat and it worked great.<br />If you do plan on using it for the Xbox one, you need the puck if you have the old controller and you need the boom mic or you will not have good chat function.<br />I own the Turtle Beach X12's for about 4 years and the sound to me on the Polk comes in cleaner.  Over all I liked my Turtle Beach X12's, but they are not compatible with the Xbox one unless I want to use my kinect, and I really don't want that.<br />I have worn the headset for over 3 hours and did not receive a headache from the head band squeezing to hard.  My ears did sweat a little, but I come to expect that and that might be me.  I did have head set cut out, but so did my controller.  So I think that might be a Xbox one issue.<br />Overall I am pleased with the the headset and Polk customer service was easy to deal with.	2015-08-05

I honestly think that the Halo 2 remastered edition is worth the money itself! I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible but it's difficult because I love these games so much. The story has so much action on top of raw emotion. There are 4 games included with this, technically 5 or 6 if you include Spartan Ops and or Halo ODST which came as a free download for me. If you've never played now is your chance to start from the very beginning of the series in remastered graphics, and 60 FPS. You can also just buy it for the online gameplay as well. All the maps, all the action at your fingertips. The price for this collection is unbelievably low considering what's included in the box.

I'm normally a pc player because I enjoy playing shooters with mouse and keyboard.  The level of skill I get to in a game is usually averaging 2/1 or 3/1 kill to death.<br /><br />The good is that this tracks good enough you may forget this isn't on a pc.  I used this on ps4 destiny and first did a search to find someone else's settings because it was a little off with the default.  This guy's settings work great.  I'm finding that a combination of what appears to be lag (even though my connection doesnt lag on pc) and builtin auto aim can be  a little akward when they interact, and i only know this because I'm now very precise with aiming.  Regardless of this, if you like facts i went from around .33 k/d matches to averaging around 1.  Still learning maps and the gear to do better.<br /><br />The gui you use on your phone with bluetooth connection simple enough and intuitive to use.  You can also do a lot of interesting  things if you are inclined...  setting up x/y sensativity to turn faster but still have precise slower moves.<br /><br />The only frustrating  thing is the detection of devices and if you let it sit for awhile and watch a movie on your ps4.  It might have lost connection to everything leaving you plugging and unplugging things.  Same happens when entering a game you may have to unplug and replug cables.  Maybe I just don't know the secrets, would be nice if their were no initialization issues.<br /><br />Either way, mouse and keyboard on the ps4 is now a real thing that has been done well.	2015-08-05

Before this game I can't think of one great Lord of the Rings video game.  So when this game came out and all of a sudden people were giving it glowing reviews I was intrigued.  And I did something I rarely do. I bought a video game I didn't know anything about.<br /><br />And I had a great time with it.<br /><br />So let's complain first shall we? Negatives:<br />The main character is utterly forgettable.  It's weird.  Everyone else in the game is modeled so well and look like they fit the Lord of the Rings universe.  But the main character (whose name I can't even remember) is forgettable and really just looks like a cheap imitation of Aragorn.  He looks like how the main character of a game that was bastardizing The Lord of The Rings would look like.<br />It's easy to get overwhelemed with how much there is to do in the game.  I found myself just going after captains every time I sat down to play.  And then I forgot what I was even doing in the main quest line and I stopped playing for a while.<br />The story is very weak.<br />The end boss/last level was a let down.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Combat is terrific.  If you're going to rip off others, rip off the best.  And they did so by ripping off Batman and Assassins Creed.  So the combat is great.  The voice acting is good.<br />It's got a lot to do (although might be too much as I said in the negatives)<br />Great graphics.<br />Nemesis system was very unique and well thought out.<br /><br />It'll be interesting to see what they do with the inevitable sequel.	2015-08-05

US	51225343	R5HX2ZCUNFYMF	B00CX8VY4S	6592984	Watch Dogs	Video Games	3	5	5	N	N	Good Ideas, Boring Excution	When Watch Dogs arrived in May 2014, it had a tumultuous reception. There was a big uproar about how the hype was false, how the videos shown at E3 didn't reflect the final state of the game, and that customers were lied to. Then there were complaints of technical issues with the game (which were supposedly patched later). Then there were complaints that the game just wasn't very good. Some liked the game, but for others, the game left a poor taste in their mouths, whether affected by the hype or not, it was unclear.  I was interested enough that I kept the game on my radar, but I was in no hurry to check it out. Over a year later I picked it up for the price of $10. I went into it with a fairly open mind, knowing it wasn't going to be a great game, but also expecting that many had reviled it based on broken expectations and the negativity hype. Unfortunately, I didn't find a sleeper hit or an unappreciated game. Yet it wasn't completely terrible game either. I want to share thoughts on Watch Dogs over some of the better games I've played just because it's interesting how it has so much potential to be better and just keeps missing the target.  The first thing you notice when you play is that it's more like Grand Theft Auto than you expected. We all knew it was open world in a modern city from videos, but coming from Ubisoft, the makers of open world Assassin's Creed games, I didn't expect it to be so much like GTA. I, like others, expected more like Assassin's Creed in the modern day, some climbing, infiltration, etc. No, you can't climb more than in a few spots. Getting around and doing stuff is just like GTA, except a little worse. Driving is not nearly as polished as you want. Shooting is fine for the most part. The city of Chicago looks great, but it feels empty. It has as many people as most GTA games, but for the actual city of Chicago, it's a ghost town. The biggest thing the game lacks compared to a comparable GTA or Saints Row is that Watch Dog lacks the fun and personality they have, but I'll get to that in a bit.  Gameplay-wise, the whole point of playing Watch Dogs is the hacking mechanic. Using the protagonist's phone, you can tap into the citywide ctOS system that has been installed in this fictional Chicago. This allows you to see information on any person around you, steal from their bank accounts, disable alarms, and hack systems. You can tap into any camera and then scan people or find other hacking opportunities. For whatever fictional reasoning, this requires line of sight, so often you need to hack a camera, from that camera look around so you have line of sight to hack another camera, and so on until you find the thing you want to hack. This often happens with security doors, where you'll get a highlighted path for the circuit and need to track it back to the switch. Once you get upgrades, hacking also allows you to raise and lower bridges, explode steam pipes under cars, raise road spikes, and other things to help you in car chases. Hacking also allows an alternative in most violent situations. Many times in the game you'll need to enter a secure area where enemies attack you on sight. Often you can hack cameras before stepping into the area. This allows you to scout the area... and cause mayhem. You can change the environment and distract the guards, but with the right upgrades, you can kill too. Watching through the cameras, you can hack circuits to explode and kill guards near them, you can set off grenades in guards' pockets, and more. Often you can soften up the guards or even kill them all through hacking. In some cases you can achieve your objective without ever stepping into the restricted area. Depending on how you do it, it can take longer than a frontal assault, but it sure is fun. When it is working, hacking is a fun part of Watch Dogs.  Which is disappointing, because that fun hacking mechanic is the top shelf feature in a game that really isn't very fun. With an interesting mechanic and apassable GTA-style open world, it's unfortunate that they made such a boring game. The story of Watch Dogs is a lesson in how to make the player not care. Set in present day Chicago, players take on the role of GravellyVoice McBadChoices (actually Aiden Pearce, but you're not going to remember that) as he tries to correct his past and we struggle to care. Aiden is a hacker-slash-thug who has been also moonlighting in town as The Vigilante (I think? It's more mentioned over and over in passing than really explained). Sometime before the start of the game, he did a job that went bad, and as retribution an assassin was sent after his sister's family and his niece was killed. GravellyVoice blames himself, so he's tracking them down to get revenge, even though his sister - the girl's mother - and pretty much everyone else says not to do it, it's not worth it, and they don't even want him to do it. But GravellyVoice McBadChoices ignores them and explores vengeance for all of, like, two missions before he's pulled into something nobody gives a damn about (not even GravellyVoice!) and his family is in danger. In a world where only gravelly-voiced protagonists can do anything, he must do what he can to save them, which means going on missions because he was told to. At least in GTA and Saints Row we get colorful characters that are amusing when telling us to do bitch work, sometimes even parodying it, but Watch Dog plays it completely serious even when ridiculous and uninspired. Eventually it makes its way back around to the vengeance angle and dips its hands into some interesting topics, but revenge takes a back seat for a long time to make you do other stuff first.  When I saw videos and marketing for Watch Dogs, I thought it would be a darker crime thriller focusing on privacy issues, corporate overreach, and information age issues. Those issues are sort of in the game, more in the late game, but for a good chunk of the game, those are setup for another plot. Instead of the cyberage concerns, I found myself dealing with low income area gangsters, sex trafficking, and occasionally stopping petty crimes for no reason. Yes, you have the option of stopping petty crimes you are alerted to on the map, but there's few explanations why you, the player, or why the character, GravellyVoice McBadChoices, would want to do them. In fact, you can &#34;mess them up&#34; by making the criminal run away, but the game counts this as a failure, only rewarding you for waiting until the criminal does the crime (sometimes killing the victim) and then taking them down. I would think chasing off the criminal would be a win too. Overall, these petty crimes are rarely fun. There's a meter for how good or bad a reputation GravellyVoice has, and stopping crime raises it (and running over pedestrians decreases it), but other than telling me it exists, the game never really explained what it did, and it never had any effect on my game experience.  Watch Dogs is full of side content and systems, but many of them are either poorly explained or of no consequence. In that respect, it feels much like Assassin's Creed 3, also by Ubisoft: it feels like a bunch of development teams worked on this, each doing a different system and content line, so there's a bunch of stuff in the game, but none of it feels very deep. There are half a dozen different collectibles, maybe half a dozen investigations (which are like collectibles but slightly different), ctOS towers to unlock (like Assassin's Creed viewpoints but more hacking, less climbing), lots of violence related side missions (gang headquarters, fixer assignments, driving activities), two VR games (shooting, and 8-bit style gold collection), city activities (poker, drinking games, etc) and four side game activities called Digital Trips with their own areas, rules, and skill trees (which are actually more fun than the main game). If you're a person who only buys a game every few months and plays the crap out of it, then this game has much to occupy you. Likewise if you're a completionist that must do everything, there's a ton to do. But like I said, it's not all fun. The game does reward you well for completing side content - you unlock guns, cars, and outfits. I appreciate that, except for the fact that most guns, cars, and outfits are not useful. The game lacks versatility in its assets, so once you've unlocked the best of something, you don't need the others. I never needed thirty guns across five equipped categories - I needed two guns, a silenced pistol and an assault rifle, which even reduced to one when they inexplicably gave me a silenced assault rifle (which is magic, by the way). I used a sniper rifle maybe three times and a grenade launcher for a single difficult hallway battle, but both of those times the assault rifle would have worked well too.  The game is not without its control and design issues. I really disliked weapon switching. In Watch Dogs, you don't pick which guns you carry with you, you have them all with you. You hold left bumper to bring up the weapon wheel, which has one of every gun type (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, etc). If you want to select a different assault rifle, you hold left bumper, use right thumbstick to highlight the gun (which felt oversensitive, as half the time when you let go of the thumbstick it switched to something else) and then you use the D-pad to cycle through guns. This was a frustrating set of hand movements for me. The game doesn't pause when you do this either, so changing a gun in a firefight can be frustrating. Also, cycling through/switching your equipped gun automatically takes it out. And unlike some other games, pedestrians immediately react. So if you're at a weapon shop and want to equip some of the guns you just bought, you cycle through the weapons and equip the weapon. The customers and weapon store owner freak out like you're robbing the place. Cops are called and you can't buy anymore guns... just because I equipped the gun he just sold me.  It can be frustrating due to difficult design or just inconsistencies. With ctOS, you can track people across town, hack their phones from afar, etc. But you still have a mission where you need to tail someone via car and not be seen, even though you already have hacked their phone - why is the GPS suddenly not working? Then he gets out of the car and you need to follow him on foot, but now the distance you have to keep is suddenly much smaller than the car. Watch Dogs also has more than a few instafail stealth mission - getting seen means the mission immediately ends, no chance to kill the dude before he tells someone, no chance to fight your way through. Just over immediately, restart. It also has one of the most frustrating boss fights I have experienced in recent memory. They put you in a cramped area with various pieces of cover. Once you enter the area you are given no new objective. The villain monologues a minute or so, you get attacked by three dudes. Kill them, and the villain monologues another minute or two. Then one of the biggest elites of the game just appears in this cramped area and you need to kill him and someone else in the scant seconds before you are ripped to shreds. Needless to say you will die the first time. You restart and guess what? You have to listen to the same villain monologues without a word changed. And the action won't start until he finishes, and you can't skip the dialog. The fight is still frustratingly hard, so you might hear this monologue eight, nine, more times. And it wasn't even a very good monologue the first time.  The car radios in the game have a selection of tracks you can listen to as you drive. You can steal them from certain pedestrians' phones. The tracks would be nice, except I've rarely listened to more than the first minute and a half of a song. You have hideouts you can fast travel to which keep you from long trips. When you're on a story mission which is the only time you can't use fast travel, the game plays its own mood music, keeping the track/radio music muted. When you are in a car and wanting to listen to music, it still gets interrupted by alerts of new missions, news broadcasts, or random story phone calls. After you finish each story mission, there are some very lengthy phone calls. Usually only one or two and right after another. But occasionally they have more once you get closer to the next story mission icon. I remember getting in my car, switching through twenty tracks, putting on a favorite Weezer song I was glad to see in the game, driving toward a side mission to waste time with, and then having this bitch call me on the phone and then talk through the whole damn song. Add to this the fact that music stops when you get out of the car, and you never really get to enjoy the music. Why was it put in? Probably because it was on a checklist rather than it made sense. There's a lot more design issues/bugs like this, but I think you get the picture.  At this point, you might be wondering why I spent the time to write this up or why I'm kicking a dead franchise horse. It comes down to seeing what they did right in this game that makes me want to see something else. I'm actually curious to see a Watch Dogs 2. Let's draw a parallel between Watch Dogs and Assassin's Creed - not completely unreasonable, since they are both by the same publisher, but I have no idea if the same dev team. Assassin's Creed 1 was full of promise and good ideas, but its execution left us with a game with some good mechanics but lots of boring gameplay and story. From that meager, almost tech demoish game came Assassin's Creed 2, a sequel that far exceeded its predecessor, taking the original game and making it into a well-done, polished game that corrected nearly every flaw of the first. Watch Dogs 2 could be that. Rather than being a first stab in the dark at something new, Watch Dogs 2 could be built on this foundation, correcting design issues and retuning to a better direction for the franchise.  Of course, I think the biggest missed opportunity of this game is plot and setting. As a present day game, Watch Dogs just doesn't work. Its blend of the familiar and unfamiliar comes off in a bad way, jarring and uninteresting. But look at the mechanics it has to work with - this would make a great CYBERPUNK game. Set it 100 years in the future, in a setting along the lines of Deus Ex or Shadowrun. All of its best parts - hacking, a gun system, crime, a big city - would fit perfectly. Instead of Watch Dogs' plot, put Blade Runner, Judge Dredd, and PsychoPass into a blender, then attach that output to Watch Dogs' hacking, shooting, and open world mechanics. That is the game I want to play. It was the specter that haunted me through my entire Watch Dogs experience.  Ultimately, Watch Dogs is a hard game to recommend if you just want to play a good game I wouldn't spend more than $10-15 on it, no matter what reason you have. If you want one game you can do stuff with over weeks/months, it's not a bad game. If you want to check out a fun hacking mechanic as a player, a game archeologist, or a game developer, then it's worth you to give the game a try. But I can't recommend it just for the game itself. Once you walk away from the game, you're never going to remember the story of GravellyVoice McBadChoices, and if you are, it's going to be for his nonsensical choices or his confusing sociopathic epilogue monologue. If you're just looking for a game to play for solid story and gameplay, you should find something else.	2015-08-05

It's too bad they never patched it to fix some of the issues it had.  But since you can import all the songs (except for 2, one of them being Sunshine of Your Love...bummer!) into Rocksmith 2 it's kind of a moot point.<br /><br />If you've never played guitar before it's a good teaching tool to get you up to speed.  If you're a seasoned guitar player...but don't have a group of friends you regularly jam with (like me) then it's a fun way to play a whole song experience.  And do so quite loudly on a surround system ;)<br /><br />After playing rocksmith I can never go back to the plastic 5 button garbage of those other guitar games.	2015-08-05

This version has killed the Elder Scrolls franchise for me.  I've had thousands of hours of enjoyment with Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, and generally always have a Oblivion and Skyrim game running.<br />But this, ug.  By taking it on-line and restricting what you can do unless you play more (on top of the high initial cost) I can't play it.  I won't pay the subscription price (Hey, I paid more than $60) all one can do is a silly bunch of fetch and carry missions.<br />Also, forget the traditional open world.  Your exploration is very limited.  You're stuck in small regions until you do meaningless tasks.  And, as I mentioned, you can't do dungeons unless you pay more.<br />The leveling system is obscure.<br />My gut tells me they looked at Neverwinter on-line and dumbed that down.<br />I've played 15 hours worth, and won't launch it again.  In fact, I've started a new Skyrim campaign to get this thing out of my head.<br />Next installation Bethesda, go back to your roots and let us single-players have a rich open world where we can do the entire range of things.	2015-08-05

I bought a PS3 near launch and didn't want to buy another system but Mass Effect seemed that awesome.  When they announced it was coming to the Playstation I rejoiced.  It's a fantastic game.  Bioware created a great trilogy and the mass effect world is so immersive you can lose chunks of time just reading all the codex entries.  If you have any fascination with astronomy, it's very cool to see them visit different parts of the milky way you're familiar with.  The gameplay is fun, storyline is epic, characters are really memorable and easy to care about and relate to and the voice acting is TOP NOTCH.  Voices fit their characters so well, whereas other games will have such terrible voice acting it pulls you out of the experience (looking at you Heavy Rain and Destiny) the voice acting here will further immerse you.  Kudos to who ever makes the voice casting decisions and the voice recording director.<br /><br />If you haven't played the mass effect trilogy, do so.  It's phenomenal.	2015-08-05

It makes working out fun and I feel like even though it's not what most people would imagine when they hear someone is working out, if it gets you moving more than you normally would be, it's worth trying. When I find time to use Wii Fit, I do a body test to measure my balance, BMI, and weight, one activity from each category twice (except aerobics, that one I change up..depending on how much time it takes I'll do anything from 2 activities once each or 3 activities twice each) and another body test to see if anything has changed. During my more work out heavy weeks, I do tend to notice a gradual loss of weight. The little pet they give you also gives some tips and explanations.<br /><br />I would agree that going out and getting a full work out at a gym is more effective, but that's if you're motivated enough on your own to actually go do that every couple of days. It's also more expensive to and there's hardly any parking around here and when there is, you have to pay for it. I expect to work my way up to that, but for now, this is a great solution imo!	2015-08-05

It's a good game and should be played and enjoyed.  But there's some stuff holding it back from being the classic it could have been.<br /><br />Clunky controls, bad voice acting, and plot holes (there's one gaping plot hole that I won't say as it gives away a twist in the game).<br /><br />The controls don't have to be as refined as say Grand Theft Auto for a game to be enjoyable, and the TellTale games are a testament to that.  Speaking of TellTale games are what Heavy Rain wishes it could be.  Play through The Walking Dead or their Game of Thrones games and you see that the controls are not ever meant to be the highlight of the game.  It's the story, characters, plot developments and voice acting that is at center stage.<br /><br />Heavy Rain has some bad voice acting that really pulls you out of the game at times ....(let's not forget JAAAAAAAAASON).<br /><br />The story line was decent and did have me compelled the first time through...till you realize all the plot holes at the end.

However the storyline is very detailed. I would describe this game as a movie that you play. I am not used to games like this. I'm more of a fan of games like Bioshock and Dead Space. However I give it 5 starts because it's extremely detailed in the story line and though its not typically the type of game I play, it keeps me interested.	2015-08-05

I ordered this product and was expecting it to be sleek and beautiful and when I tore open the envelope, which was ridiculous the game is $50 it deserves a mailing box. When I tore open the mailing envelope I got a torn plastic sleeve. Disappointing, and I don't even know if the games work yet. Hopefully they do, or its getting sent back.	2015-08-05

I was lucky enough to get one that was working perfectly, even after weeks of settings on my games at 100% force feedback. It also came with the latest firmware already installed. The force feedback is really strong and you can always tell when you're losing traction. There's a bit of a learning curve, if you buy this for Forza 5, I recommend starting with 360 degrees and slowly working your way up to 900. If you start with maximum settings and no experience, it'll be very hard to control. I took off a half point because of the stock wheel. If you're not picky, it has rubber grips where your hands are and metal paddles. If you are a seasoned professional sim addict, however, I recommend the full rubber GTE rim or, for $50 more, the full leather and brushed steel rim offered by Thrustmaster. The brake and gas paddles are fine, they do the job and are made of metal. I also recommend purchasing a Wheelstand Pro with this. It will give you incredible stability and the comfort of being able to put it away when not in use. Either way, the desk clamp is also efficient and does it's job very well. Overall, with some upgrade parts from Thrustmaster or just by itself, this is the best wheel for Xbox One and I highly recommend it.	2015-08-05

US	13121195	R1ABVG4GU2QBLO	B00DHF39HQ	32807762	The Elder Scrolls Online	Video Games	4	1	3	N	N	The diet coke of Skyrim	For the first 10 or so levels of this game, I hated it. I had already looked up the trade in value at Best Buy and made the decision to trade it in.  After watching a few YouTube videos of the gameplay, I decided to give it another shot.  As I increased my level, started to pay attention to the lore/guild quests and became more accustomed to the travel system, I found a lot to like about the game.  That being said, there are a lot of issues that need to be worked out before I can count ESO among the great online MMO's.  I've detailed a few pros and cons below. I gave the game 4 stars, but I would rate it 3.5 if it would let me.<br /><br />PRO'S<br />1.) It is different.  There are a lot of people that are saying how different this is than Skyrim.  While the story isn't nearly as tight as Skyrim, you would be a little daft not to see the similarities.  The combat and feel of the game are pure Elder Scrolls. The combat, love it or hate it, is one of a kind in MMO's. While I personally believe that the no lock on, free flow combat style of the Elder Scrolls series worked fine for the single player games, a lock on system would be very beneficial for the MMO aspect.  I really wouldn't hold my breath for that though, since that would probably take a whole combat design rewrite.<br /><br />2.) Free to play.  I have never really been tempted to buy anything from the crown store at all.  I did buy a horse, but it was only because I didn't want to wait to start leveling it up.  All the stuff you can buy is completely optional (at least until the DLC gets released).<br /><br />3.) First person mode.  I am in the minority here, but I absolutely love playing in first person. People tell me about how much of a disadvantage that puts me in during combat, but I do not care.  This is one of the only MMO's that lets me play in first person mode. I personally hate the third person perspective (it makes me a little queasy for some reason).<br /><br />4.) The main story quests. The main story quests along with the guild quests are very well done. The quests are fully voiced and pretty fun to run through.  You can tell there was a lot of effort put into making the quests as meaningful as you can in an MMO.<br /><br />CON'S<br /><br />1.) GROUPING.  This is the glaring problem I have with ESO at this point. The dungeon finder doesn't function as well as it should and even when it does, there can be long waits for groups.  This causes people to be either in the middle of other quests or AFK by the time you finally get a group (and I play a tank). Also, since most people do the &#34;any dungeon&#34; option, the game doesn't give you the option to fast travel to a specific dungeon.  You literally just appear in a four man group and are supposed to get to whatever dungeon you want the group to do. In a nutshell, this means 30+ minutes to find the group, 15+ minutes of people talking about which dungeon to do, plus 15-20 minutes waiting on that 4th guy that isn't on the same page as everyone else to get to the dungeon. You can fast travel to anyone else in the group, which is nice, but unless the whole group is ATK and ready you are still screwed. There needs to either be a quick voting option for dungeons once the group is formed or just let the game pick for you (if you picked random).  Then the whole group can get the option to respond and be transported to the entrance to the dungeon (Like WoW). The whole grouping thing is often made worse by the second CON on my list.....<br /><br />2.) Communication. The chat is local/group/guild VOICE only. When this works it is amazing.  When you have a good 4 man group of guys (or gals) chatting your way through a dungeon it is an awesome experience. When everyone has a mic and at least an average level of intelligence, ESO has some of the best grouping in any MMO I've played.  Unfortunately, oftentimes this isn't the case.  Some people refuse to get a mic or even put their volume up so they can hear the rest of the group.  This causes a lot of issues because there is no other way to communicate.  Many groups have wiped over and over again due to a lack of any way to communicate with certain members. People have been asking for text chat, but I am not sure that would work much better in a console setting. Local chat is almost always useless and filled with children either playing stupid radio songs or high pitched screeching sounds. This is something that needs to be dealt with sooner rather than later.<br /><br />3.) Side quests. While the main quests are well done, the side quests are pointless.  For some reason, side quests give very little in the way of rewards.  They are very low EXP and if there is a prize, it is usually a lot amount of gold or a crappy item.  There are no faction lines or any other reasons at all to complete these quests.  It is infinitely quicker to level up by just killing random enemies over and over than by doing the side quests. There needs to be some incentive to do these side quests as there are a huge amount of them in the game.<br /><br />While this wasn't a definitive list, it is my main thoughts on the state of the game.  The game is still very new on consoles, so I hope some of the issues can be ironed out over the coming months. If ESO can fix some of its grouping/communication issues and add better end game content it can absolutely be in it for the long haul.  If you liked Skyrim or just the ES series in general then this game is worth a try.f the group.  This causes a lot of issues because there is no other way to communicate.

All the buttons, the cross pad and analog sticks worked and felt perfect. The setup was a no brainer. Works awesome on all my Android Nintendo, Sega, Game Boy and other emulators. I love the fact that the button mapping comes pre assigned, with options to change the mapping to your liking of course. Received in a timely manner considering the item came all the way from China.

The campaign is amazing even if the Arkham Knight is not as amazing the campaign is full of surprises. It may be a little heavy on drone combat but is still fun. But with old faces coming back it is easy to over look. More bosses would have been better. With a bit less of the Bats car. Dual play with another hero is awesome and makes fun combat. Parts of the game dive into the mind of the batman and are simply the best moments of the game or even series you have to experience it yourself with an old friend adding more to those moments. Amazing but to be honest Arkham city was still better a 10/10 Arkham knight 9.5/10	2015-08-05

US	41446882	R1RU2QI2CEA10O	B00KWFCUNS	877300929	Kirby & The Rainbow Curse	Video Games	2	1	1	N	N	This game is greatly compromised by the lack of refinement in the controls.	In my opinion, this game has beautiful, clay-like graphics, and nice, classy music. I like how cute and colorful the game is... However, it seems to me that the game's development was somewhat rushed. The most glaring example of this is that the stylus controls are not well done. I think it's fun and fresh to control Kirby in a creative way by drawing lines with a stylus on the tablet, but in my opinion Nintendo has done a poor implementation of these controls. It seems to me that Kirby often does not get onto a line drawn, even if it is started on top of him, or directly below him (where I'd imagine his paws are). Also, I noticed that lines often erase so quickly by the game that it seems to compromise the gameplay, and multiple interconnecting lines have to be used - all while hoping that the dubious controls code will work correctly at the intersection(s), which is often not the case. I would expect that Kirby would run towards the beginning of a rainbow line (at least as long as it was accessible from where he is), which he generally does not do in my experience. I think it has the potential to be a great game, but needs a well-coded controls software patch to realize more of its potential. Especially for a Nintendo game, I was very disappointed in this lack of controls refinement.	2015-08-05

So many fashion games are cheaply and poorly made, this one puts all the others to shame. It's not simply a great fashion game, it's one of the best games made for the 3DS platform in any genre.<br /><br />First, and most importantly, there are over 10,000 articles of clothing for the player to acquire in the game. The clothes are arranged so that the player can experiment with practically infinite combinations to create outfits. You do not simply pick a dress, you choose a shirt, an undershirt, skirt or pants, jacket, hat, gloves, necklace, tights or socks, and shoes. There is also a lot of variety in the styles of the clothes, everything from daring and bold to sweet and conservative, to goth lolita or harajuku pop. The options are endless.<br /><br />There is much more to the game play than simply dress up though. The game has the player character play the part of a store manager, helping customers with requests, learning about what styles appeal to which customers, managing the back room stocks and purchasing new styles from suppliers. You also promote your store by participating in competitive fashion shows which get more and more challenging as you play.<br /><br />The store management might be too difficult for young children to play without adult help, but anyone above ten or so should get hours and hours of fun from this game.	2015-08-05

I really feel it, as I've got a nice coating of sweat when I've finished my workouts. I'm about to finish my first 4-Week Porgram and I couldn't be happier. Couple this with proper nutrition and it really works. I've lost some LBs already. It's nice to get the heart pounding for 3-min-1hr every day in the comfort of my home. However, don't think it's comfortable. As I've said, this thing makes you work! I live in a small apartment and I can still fit in everything I need to. I move forward/backward no more than 4 feet, and side-to-side about 6 feet. Get a yoga mat, too. It makes it more comfortable.	2015-08-05

So I can honestly say after a few months of using this controller I can give it 1 star. It works great for 2 weeks.  Then the joystick starts to stick, just enough to notice. Since its high sensitivity it becomes even more noticeable on gameplay. I returned it and got another. 2 weeks later, same thing. Okay whatever I can deal with it. That earned a 2 star. 3 weeks into the 2nd controller and it now does not power on. Got my money back and on to something that actually can work..	2015-08-05

Now, when I first got the controller I neglected to charge it the recommended 1 - 2 hours. I initially thought this caused an issue I encountered where the controller would not power on unless it was plugged in. Yes it charged, yes I'm sure, yes I held the button in for 3 or more seconds. It never came on if it was unplugged. Once I plugged it in and powered it on I could unplug it and worked like magic. I've had the controller maybe three weeks now, and I was using fine about an hour ago. I just went to plug it in to turn it on and it will no longer charge. Yes I'm sure the cable works, no I didn't drop or damage it in any way shape or form, yes I'm kinda bummed about it. Bottom line is that is two-too-many issues to have with a brand new device that is advertised as a high quality merchandise. Maybe Nyko isn't the brand for me.	2015-08-05

I love new options and traveling but the game had a serious issue in &#34;read this description&#34; that doesn't explain much. If you are a cop or in the law inforcemant you will get to foal to train in martial arts yet no where does it tell you how in the lessons. I finally found an online forum that explained you have to go over seas to even start that option. The lessons are crap which is why I give them a 4 start rating. When going to China/Japan...There are opportunities that are just totally confusing. You find the market place but it sells good but not supplies like the other areas. You go do your dungeon run and it is very repetitive to all the others. I now have all this metal and stones and pretty process and no clue what to do with them.<br />I gave this expansion a 3 star due to repetitiveness of the dungeons and the lack of real information in the lessons. (which is a whole game issue) I run Windows 8.1 and haven't had any glitches yet. As I explore more of the world available with this one I might change my review some but for now, hope this helps you out.	2015-08-05

After a couple of days on my new ps4 it started acting strange and felt warm and cutting off randomly. So I unplugged vertical cooling stand and placed my ps4 horizontal again and back into its well ventilated space again with a normal house fan and haven't had a problem since. If you look closely at the vents you can see were being horizontal to me makes more sense as all the components can cool equally. Vertical the lower parts heat runs up through the rest of the system as we all know heat rises. I am not saying that the ps4 isn't made to run vertical  because it is, but if you play alot of hours you may want to re think this. And some of you may have used this unit with know problems. I only know that it didn't work well for me.	2015-08-05

All I can say is WOW!  I didn't have high hopes for this because it was at a &#34;Too good to be true&#34; price.  But WOW.  This thing, once installed, looks as if it was part of my XBOX One from the start.  Very nicely done cosmetically wise!<br /><br />I went to Fry's, after getting this, and bought a Seagate 2TB External Backup Plus Slim drive.  Plugged it into my Windows 10 computer and [Right-Click] Start  then  Disk Management.  Found the drive and Deleted the volume. This brought it to an Unformatted/Unpartitioned stated.<br /><br />I then promptly Ripped it apart to get the drive out of it. (For WHATEVER reason, the External 2TB's are always 25%-50% cheaper than stand alone drives.)<br /><br />I opened the Drive panel on this enclosure and plugged the hard drive into it.  Closed the panel.  DO NOT PLUG IT IN YET!<br /><br />Powered ON the Xbox.  Once it was at my main screen, I plugged this into the side.  Within a few seconds  DO YOU WANT TO FORMAT THIS DRIVE?  Heck yeah!  It is, also, now selected as my Primary download drive.  Anything I need intense speed from, I'll copy it back to main 500GB drive.<br /><br />All in all... GET THIS IF YOU HAVE AN XBOX ONE!!!<br /><br />11/17/15 update.  STILL ROCKS!<br /><br />02/04/16 update.  STILL ROCKS!	2015-08-05

I work on my computer 10-12 hours a day have been using these glasses for about 2 weeks. BUT, the minute I put them on I could feel my eyes relax.  Thank you :) The lenses sit on my face pretty well so I barely notice them.  I like that they curve slightly around your face,  and the frames and lenses are very lightweight.  I give them 3 stars because the side arms are not adjustable.  There is one little place you can slide the arm in and out in length (just a few centimeters) which doesn't really accomplish much.  The area where the frames and the arms hook together is not adjustable so you can't move the arms to personalize the fit. For the price I would think that would be an option.  Thank you.	2015-08-05

Then followed by Pocket Monsters Blue and Pocket Monsters Yellow. All these games were hits,and made it to the US.<br /><br />Red and Green only came out in Japan. Not the US. The graphics are much worse then the Red and Blue graphics. Many pokemon looked ugly,and stupid,so Nintendo made Pocket Monsters Blue. There Blue is our Red and Blue. The graphics for Blue,is the same as the graphics in Red and Blue. Some glitches were also fixed in Blue version,and was passed over to R/B versions. The only differences is the language. That's it. Pocket Monsters Red and Green are different from Red and Blue. Pocket Monsters Red is like pokemon Red,but different. Different dialogue,glitches,and graphics. The games became successful,and Nintendo released more games.<br /><br />On TV TOKYO,pokemon became a Anime in 1997. It became a hit,and was followed by Pocket Monsters Yellow in 1998. Electric Solider Porygon came out in December 12,1997. The bright blue and red lights caused seizures,a symptom when something the human brain cannot take recations. It causes all sorts of sideffects. Many Japanese children got headaches. As well as eye strain,vomiting,bloody noses and bloody mouths. Over 600 children were rushed to the hospital. No one died,but we're hurt. It hit the news in America,and many people criticised pokemon. They thought the Japanese series shouldn't come out in the US. 4Kids still released the pokemon anime in 1998,and still became a hit. However,the episode never came out anywhere outside Japan,even with repaired animations. It wasn't Porygon,but Pikachu. Pikachu used a thunderbolt attack,which hit the missile,and caused the bright lights. It went on for 5 seconds,and caused seizures. Don't watch the episode. It's not safe,for kids anyways. What's this have to do with Red and Green? Well,a story like this with the games were very similar. Lavender Town Syndrome. This is a myth,not true. The myth is about the music from Lavender Town. The myth is is that children who listened to the music got headaches from the load music straining on the Nintendo GameBoy systems speaker. This caused children to kill each other. This isn't true. If this was true,there would have been news reports on it,and pokemon would have been bann. Including Red and Blue. No one died. It might have been annoying to listen to it,but nothing happened. The Japanese music is not the same as the American music. The American version isn't a strong. Anyways,pokemon still was considered violent. But,this has nothing to do with the Syndrome. It has to do with the Cards,Games,and Anime. Watch this one YouTube:Pokemon on the news. Look for pokemon news report 1999. It will talk about it. For one thing,they are all trolls. They all say pokemon wrong. They also say how violent and brutle it was. It's not a message of violence. It's clearly rated E for everyone for every box. Well sure,you go around catching monsters and they beat the crap out of each other,but really,it's not like there killing each other. They aren't. Also,the games are good to improve reading skills. It's bann from every single School across the country. 16 years later and it's still bann. Mostly the Cards. All for violence? Really? No. Not worth it. Well,4 months after the insistent,pokemon was back on in Japan in April of 1998 on TV TOKYO. Then,in September 8th of 1998,pokemon hit the US as a popular Anime.<br /><br />But how about talking about the games? The games are the same as Red and Blue. Sharing the same Character's,music,plot,trainers,and towns. Want to know why it's called Red and Green? Red is the boy you play as. He is aiming to catch 'em all and become a pokemon master. He has a rival called Green who wanted to train pokemon to the limit. The two main characters are Red and Green,so the games were  named after them. Pocket Monsters Yellow came out to be like the Anime,was became a success. It featured Pikachu as the games mascot,he has his own voice,you can get all three starters,and has better graphics. Thanks to the popularity,Pocket Monsters Stadium came out the same year. It came of for the Nintendo 64,and it had only 43? Pokemon. It wasn't big,so in 1999,Pocket Monsters Stadium2 came out to have all 150 pokemon. Pokemon Stadium,which was made in 2000 in America is Japan's Stadium 2. Stadium in America has all the pokemon expect for Mew and Mewtwo. In 2000,Pocket Monsters Stadium:Gold and Silver came out,having all new pokemon. In America,that was Stadium 2. Pocket Monsters Trading Card Video Game was made,having fans play pokemon Cards on the go. This was released in 1999 for the Nintendo GameBoy Color. Pocket Monsters Snap came out in 1999,having the player take pics of pokemon in 3D. Pocket Monsters TCG came out in 1998,and was huge. There were tons of Cards to collect,and trade,which made them so popular. In fact,the Holographic Chazarid is really the one that was popular. It was so rare,so not many fans could find them in packs.<br /><br />Thanks to Pocket Monsters Red and Green,pokemon became huge. For a game that was made in 1996,it's still fun. However,there's more to talk about. After the first episode of Pocket Monsters came out in Japan,Ho-Ho,a second gen pokemon was seen flying in the sky near a rainbow. Most fans have beaten Red and Green,and that wasn't one of the 150 pokemon. Nintendo announced Pocket Monsters 2:Gold and Silver. They were suppose to come out later that year of 1997,but failed. It wasn't until 1999 when Pocket Monsters Gold and Silver hit stores. These games were different then originally planed. There was many different pokemon designs,and towns,and route designs,as well as different graphics. Nintendo failed with this,and only 100 new pokemon were made. However,it was made for a more advance system,the GBC. These games had color,shiny pokemon,genders,New gym leaders,bugs fixed,two new types,Speical split,eggs,and registrationing items. It wasa hit,and in 2000,Pocket Monsters Crystal came out with the choice of beging a girl,battle Animations,bugs fixed,more storyline with Suicone,and even a even with Celebi!!!! A new Anime,called pokemon Johto Journeys came out the same year as Gold and Silver,1999. Pokemon The movie 2000 came out in Japan in 1999 with new pokemon. Another moive,called Mewtwo Strikes back came out in 1998. These moives were in theaters,both in Japan and the US. Pocket Monsters Puzzle Leauge came out for the Nintnedo GBC,around when Stadium G/S came out. It was alot like Tetris.<br /><br />In 2002,Pocket Monsters Ruby and Sapphire were made,and had more things,like double battles,new pokemon,pokemon contests,and more. Pocket Monsters Colosseum was a spin off for the 3rd gen in 2003. 3rd gen is when the series started to die down. However,with the help of Pocket Monsters Fire Red and Leaf Green,it made it more popular. They were remakes of Pocket Monsters Red and Green. They were hits,having everything,old,new. These games were released in 2004,for the Nintendo GameBoy Advanced. The same year,Pocket Monsters Emerald came out,as a squeal to Ruby and Sapphire and is suppose to be amazing. Pocket Monsters XD Gale of Darkness came out for the Nintendo GameCube in 2005,with a storyline of Shadow Lugia.<br /><br />In 2006,Pocket Monsters Diamond and Peral came out for the Nintendo DS. This was many fans first pokemon games. They were hits,and sold around 16 million copies. In 2008,Pocket Monsters Platuim came out,as a better installment. It was much more fun then D/P. In 2009,something new happened. Pocket Monsters Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out as remakes of Pocket Monsters Gold and Silver. They were hits,letting you have pokemon out of there pokeballs,like in Yellow. They were the remakes for the 10th anniversary of Pocket Monsters.<br /><br />For 2010,Pocket Monsters Black and White came out,it was a disappointment for fans. Thankfully,Pocket Monsters Black 2 and White 2 came out in 2012 as squeals. They allowed fans to catch more pokemon,and a inverter story. They are much better.<br /><br />For 2013,Pocket Monsters X and Y came out worldwide,as the first Nintnedo game to be a worldwide launch. It was boring,in my opinion,and it wasn't very good. Pocket Monsters Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire came out in 2014,another worldwide launch. They were also not fun.<br /><br />For 2015,Pocket Monsters Super Mystery Dungeon is coming out in fall of 2015 for Japan,and Hoilday season for the US in 2015. 2016 is the 20th anniversary of pokemon,so,maybe a Yellow remake or another Red and Blue remake. Then,a Diamond/Pearl remake.<br /><br />For these games,they are classics,and are fun to play. If you can't read Japanese,or don't know what Red/Blue are like,play Red or Blue first,and memorize the game. Also,learn to write Japanese,to understand it better. Remember to buy handbooks. Anyway,good game.	2015-08-05

It can be adjusted &#34;just so&#34; and is not in the way, yet near enough to your mouth to work very well.<br /><br />Installation was easy as well. Plug the dongle into the Xbox (you'll need some space to the left of the unit to allow for this), and the pairing with the headphones is already established. If there is a problem, you can re-pair the unit and the voice prompts will lead you through it. Very reassuring.<br /><br />Great sound, too.<br /><br />There really is only one real drawback to these, and that is the fact that they must be plugged into the micro-USB cable to recharge. Oh, and the included cable tends to slip out. Okay, two drawbacks. This would be better if there were some sort of hanger for them that would charge them when put away, but no such luck here. The battery does seem to last a very long time, though, so this isn't as big a problem as it could be.<br /><br />Overall, recommended.<br /><br />Sean Logue, 2015	2015-08-05

I have it projecting to a 100&#34; projection screen and it is fantastic, nostalgic fun.  Although it works great, it does feel pretty flimsy and breakable when trying to insert a game.  It is top loading, so you have to push the game straight down into the slot.  It is a tight fit, and pushing a game down hard enough to get it seated in the slot FEELS like you are pushing almost hard enough to break it.  Time will tell if this is true, and it has survived insertion and removal of 6 games so far, but it does not feel very solid.  For $20, totally worth being able to play some old Nintendo games.	2015-08-05

And I'll write it how I want to, or I'll end it here! (anybody who played the game should get it lol).<br /><br />Really though, I am voicing my opinions about this game. It may not be the most popular one, but I am still going to say it.<br /><br />I didn't really like the game.<br />.<br />Yup, I said it. I didn't like it all that much. I have my reasons, and I'll get to those.<br /><br />This game is loved by many a Final Fantasy fan. I am a Final Fantasy fan. I may not have played every single one, and I haven't played many of the older ones, but I have played my fair share, and this consider myself a fan of this series. To date, I have played: Final Fantasy 3(DS version), Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy 7 Dirge of Cerberus, Final Fantasy 10, a bit of X-2, 12, 13, 13-2 (eww), and some Lighting Returns (hate it).<br /><br />As I said, not many of the older ones, but I feel like I've played enough to consider myself a fan.<br /><br />But, I digress. I must get to the review of this game.<br /><br />So this game is pretty cheesy. Cheesy main character, cheesy guardian of main character, cheesy love interest of main character, cheesy friend of main character, cheesy other friend of main character, cheesy frenemies of main character, cheesy hobbies/interests of main character, cheesy story, cheesy plot twist, cheesy everything. Enough cheese to give you a life time of mac n' cheese. Or nachos. Or maybe both.<br /><br />The story is nothing to write home about. Some guy runs into a mysterious guy who knows the main character(we never find out how they met) and then a giant monster attacks and he's sent off to another world, waking up in some ruins where he's alone and freezing/starving to death. I won't go any further into the story, for fear of spoiling, but what happens after is fairly predictable.<br /><br />One thing though. The music that starts when you are in the ruins is simply amazing. Most of the music in this game is actually really amazing, The soundtrack is one good reason to keep playing the game. Boss fights, area music, all of the music is worth giving a listen.<br /><br />As some may know, this is the first Final Fantasy game with voice acting...and it really shows, but in a bad way. The voice acting is plain painful to listen to at times. The main character has the worst voice. His love interest always sounds breathy when she speaks and it gets so annoying. His guardian dude is a really good voice actor in my opinion, definitely the best in the game. But the rest, I wish I could mute. Especially that awful forced laughter scene....*shivers*<br /><br />The graphics are actually really amazing too. It amazes me what Square was able to do with the limited hardware of the PS2. 'm not kidding when I say that I could easily compare some of the cutscenes to Playstation 3 tier graphics. I personally believe that graphics don't make a good game. if the story and gameplay are good then the graphics don't matter *cough*FinalFantasy7*cough*. But Final Fantasy 10 has some unbelievable graphics on it.<br /><br />Now, for the villains. The main enemy is called Sin. Blahblahblah big deal nobody cares. But my favorite villain of all time (for now) resides in this game. I won't spoil him, but he is the best villain in all of Final Fantasy to me. Why? His voice suits his character very well in my opinion. It sounds friendly but when you learn his true intentions, then you hear the sinister undertone. He keeps coming back. No matter what you do, he has a great habit of popping up at the most random and inconvenient of times, even after you kill him repeatedly. His boss fights give you a difficult time, especially the Flux version. His boss fights (especially the final one) always come paired with yet another amazing soundtrack. Good enough that you don't want to kill him so you can keep listening.<br /><br />I had quite a bit of positive things to say about this game, and that's why I give it 3 stars. It needed some work. The story and twist felt mediocre, the voice acting for the most part wasn't even tolerable. It wasn't my favorite in the series, but it also wasn't the worst. That spot would be reserved for Lightning Returns, which was bad enough that I couldn't play for more than an hour. I was able to play 10-2 for longer than that, and 10-2 was horrible to me as well. Also, I want everybody to know that I rarely leave a review on a game unless I have beaten the game at least once. I reserve writing a review before that for the horrible games.ome work.

It's not the horrible net code and all that other crap, it's the actual game. The campaign is poorly thought out and the main character has no personality whatsoever, but who really cares about the campaign these days. There are just too many things in the multiplayer, while I appreciate all these new and old awesome features like attack chopper smart rockets and incendiary smoke screens, I completely hate the rest. The gun mechanics are just too damn complicated; often times the best guns are like the second to last unlocked guns or earlier when traditionally the best guns are the last. The entirety of the game is just some stupid plot milk money out of the buyers: the battle pack system which gives a small chance of something nice and conveniently one could buy these battle packs rather waste time and work an insane amount for just one gold battle pack, the best guns and features are usually buried in the dlc, the map design, specifically in rush, is horrible and I can guarantee under my two hanging balls that the designs were just taken from somewhere else and copied and pasted in the game. In rush the object is to arm a set of bombs and move to the next until you have destroyed all of them, and naturally the challenge to arm the bombs gets harder and harder the more you move in, wether it be the bomb thrown into a small room that can be easily defended or there are more tactical positions for the enemy to hide in and defend, but in this game the bombs are just thrown almost at random into the map. There are some gun attachments that are essentially different skins of others, such as there being three different silencers that practically all do the same thing, or there being multiple ever so slightly different laser sights. There are just way too many things that complicate the game more than it already is. This is like Pizza Hut's move of adding much more products to their menu only thing is that Pizza Hut was actually successful.	2015-08-05
