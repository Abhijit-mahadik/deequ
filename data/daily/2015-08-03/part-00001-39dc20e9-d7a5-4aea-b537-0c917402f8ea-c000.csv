I was hoping for an attractive and functional shoe. I wanted them to be my cute, go to, wear all summer shoes but sadly they're not. They are super cute. And they're very well made. But for all day wear they are just not comfortable enough. Not for me anyway. I work on my feet. I'm standing and walking on concrete floors for 4-5 hours at a stretch. When wearing these shoes my feet begin to hurt after about 3 hours. They fit well (though I have suffered through a few painful heel blisters breaking them in) and they are comfortable in that they are not tight and they do not pinch but they offer very little arch support and the soles are not made to stand up to hours of concrete floor usage. I'll probably stick to wearing them on my days off when I know that I won't be doing a lot of standing or walking. Luckily I got them on sale for about $70.00 so I don't feel too let down!	2015-08-03

The inner material is very soft, very smooth and has no sharp inner seams.  The removable insole is thoroughly padded and looks as if it will be easily washable.  The sole rubber is super tacky and grips well.  &#34;Slipper mode&#34; with the heel stomped in is pretty convenient, however MY FAVORITE FEATURE is the split tongue, I had never seen this before this model shoe and Im now convinced that all shoes should be made this way.  There are two tongues on this shoe that overlap in the center with each one being sewn to one side under the eyelets.  This is cool because its like how a work boot has a connected 1-piece tounge to keep out dirt, which this does, but it also accommodates my particularly wide foot.  I bought these in the same size I wear in classic vans.  These shoes have a basic streamlined profile but more support and comfort than other canvas shoes I've had in the past.  I highly recommend, I'm buying a pair for my girlfriend too	2015-08-03

I feel like I'm walking on the bed of the sandal awkward though because the cloth straps do not keep your foot secure.  More than once, I've stepped off the base of the sandal while walking.  I have to be very careful when walking to make sure my feet stay &#34;in&#34; the sandal.  And no, I do not have a wide foot.  Maybe if I would have ordered a size down, they might have fit better?  I can't recommend that as I haven't tried a smaller size, but something just doesn't feel right wearing them.  They are super cute though!	2015-08-03

Haven't really had the chance to wear these for very long, as I bought them for the beach and ocean.  My feet are wide, at least a C width, but I got these in Medium and they're fine (why I answered &#34;somewhat wide&#34;).  I thought that the upcurled toe would be annoying, but once your foot is inside the sandal, the sandal goes flat.  It's a cute design and seems to be very comfortable.  As my feet age, I need that arch support thing all of the time and Merrell's just go so well with my feet.  I got them on sale, so the value was REALLY good.

Sometimes when buying flip flops, a size 6 is a bit too small, but not with these.<br /><br />They are nice looking shoes, too, but Im really all about the comfort, as I have had chronic plantar fasciitis for 15 years, have fibromyalgia, and have the world's most sensitive feet. I rarely find shoes that are comfortable enough on my feet to wear, so these shoes have made me very happy.	2015-08-03

I don't like to wear flip flops too much because they often cause me to trip.  These are super comfortable...and no tripping for me so far!

This shoe is light weight and very comfortable. The laces were too small which is why I dinged this product a star. At this price, the laces should be long enough, but they seem like kid's laces. Great shoe though.	2015-08-03

They're clearly knock-offs, but that doesn't stop them from being excellent. The second I put them on, they fit. No breaking in required. The canvas is nice and soft, but not too soft. They don't have any arch support, but they're flats, what do you expect? Plus they're cute! Not fancy by any means, but you can definitely dress them up more than you'd be able to expect to. My only complaint is that they last just under 6 months of moderately hard use (a lot of walking). But for $18, that it's at all surprising. I've bought 3 pairs so far. I'll probably buy more.	2015-08-03

I ordered an 8 1/2 Wide - they are far too small.  When I remove the inner foot pad, they are clearly marked 8 Wide in pen on the bottom of the foot pad.  Perhaps the fact that some of these pairs of shoes are mis-marked would account for all the reviews that state they are too small.  The other pair of Grasshoppers I purchased in a size 8 1/2 Wide are actually a little large, but I kept them.  Same type of shoe.  I am now going to have to pay shipping back to return this pair.  I think that if the size that is sent out is wrong, the seller should be paying the return shipping charge and provide a prepaid label to use .	2015-08-03

I like this one too and will keep it but hope that the part where the strap is will soften and stretch a bit. That part is too narrow for my wide foot/feet. (ordered this in a wide). Even with the velcro tab adjustability it's still tight. Plenty of room in the toe box so that's one less concern. Not a super supportive shoe/sandal but comfortable enough and really fits well...other than the narrow portion.	2015-08-03

They fit very snugly (I ordered a size 10) but are completely comfortable with light weight wool socks. They are almost flat but the rubber sole coating prevents slipping. I was pleasantly surprised that I could wear them for hours, including walking on pavement, right out of the box. The only slight down is that they fit so snugly that it takes some wrestling to get my feet in property. I've gotten several compliments on them.	2015-08-03

Although the dimensions are listed with interior and exterior measurements, the photo is still misleading.  It gives an appearance of having a larger height  than it actually does. The exterior measurements go from the bottom of the bag to the top of the handle, not the base of the bag to the top of bag itself.  In addition, the hardware on the bag I received had cheap gold hardware and handles.  The sequins are gorgeous and the concept would perfect if it was a bag with a few more inches of material in the height.  Not good for everyday use but would be ok for a night out. On the  plus side, the zippers were sturdy and the interior pockets functioned well.  Due to the size issue, I will be returning this bag.  If they make a bigger bag with the same sequins and silver hardware, I would definitely buy it!	2015-08-03

I have many dress shoes from them.<br /><br />I purchased size 10 and size 11 because I was unsure the fit when ordering it from Amazon.com  I liked the sandals when I first put them on. I really did.  But I've worn them once for a couple hours and the memory foam never went back to the way it was supposed to.  It's now a permanent indent from my feet.  I thought memory foam was able to bounce-back to its original shape (hence the &#34;memory&#34; designation).  But unlike a memory foam mattress or mattress cover these just created permanent indents.  I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them based on this design.  Wish I had known this information prior to purchase.<br /><br />I also wished I had seen the disclaimer information regarding shipping.  I had no idea at time of purchase that shipping costs would be incurred for sending the wrong size back.  It was an oversight on my part but it was a huge let down to have to pay $12 ground shipping back because I wanted to check the size.  Had I known this I would have went to an outlet or store and tried them on first.  Now I know.  I most likely won't order any Nunn Bush products online anymore.  Nothing against the company, it's just a lot of money to pay to return something that is brand new and you lose about 1/4 of the money for really nothing.	2015-08-03

I bought a pair a couple months ago on an Amazon daily deal.  I liked them so much that I bought another pair in a different color (no daily deal.)  I sometimes have a problem with a regular width shoe being too narrow, but these shoes are on the wide side and feel great.  There is plenty of room in the toe area.  The sole is very comfy and provides support.  The shoes are very cute.  I am a senior citizen, and my much younger youngest daughter even likes them.  I now wear them when I go walking on paved paths or streets.  The bottom of the shoe is very knobby, and stones get stuck very easily, causing a clicking sound when the shoe hits the pavement.  For this reason I don't wear these shoes when hiking in the woods.  They are great for shopping also.  I love them.	2015-08-03

The length was fine, but they quickly stretch wide in the back portion of the shoe which decreases the fit to uncomfortably loose.

The Chacos and Keens seemed better suited for such activities, based on what others on the trip were wearing.	2015-08-03

I've been running in ASICS Gel Kayano shoes regularly for many years.  The latest incarnation is very nice.  The fit is good for my foot (average arches and slightly wide) and they are relatively comfortable right out of the box, although they did take a little break-in before I was comfortable running in them.  My experience with break-in is that the cushioning needs to be compressed and contoured; I had too much squishing and foot movement inside the shoe for the first few hours.  After that I was good to go.	2015-08-03

I bought them for a 5 day Disney trip with my two kids. I was also 5 months pregnant at the time of the trip (June). First, what the others say about the strap across the top of your foot is true, within a couple of hours it was way too tight and causing a lot of friction on my foot. I had to basically make the Velcro part on top super loose so that it was only the sewn on elastic part that was holding on the sandal.<br />Second, my heels had awful blisters by the end of day 2. The friction from my heel rubbing against the back of the sandal was awful and my arches were killing me. Overall not a great experience but when worn for short periods of time they can be comfortable. I just would not recommend for any activity where there is a lot of walking. My 3 year old wears Keen sandals and loves them but for me, I might try a different style next time around. These are sitting in my closet and haven't made much of an appearance since June. Disappointing for the money I paid for them.	2015-08-03

Adjustable slides are tough to find, so I  was excited to see these shoes.  I first saw this style at an ecco outlet store and had to try them on. I bought a pair at the outlet store and have come to Amazon to purchase the other color also. They are great ,  The style is sleek and understated and because of this they can dress up or down.  The footbed is soft and comfortable and even has a bit of arch support.  I have mentioned the the adjustable straps, which are great.  As I typically wear a wide width shoe, I was interested in the comments that the shoe is narrow.  For me, the adjustability of the straps compensates for the for the width and, the straps do not dig in at all. About sizing on ecco shoes.  I have always worn a size 38 in ecco dress shoes vs a 37 in their sporty sandals.  I decided to compare the two directly.  It seems that the 38 in this style is almost the same as the size 37 &#34;Jab&#34; sandals (which fit fine). Interestingly enough, the 37 &#34;Offroad Lite&#34; sandals as about 1/2-1 inch wider and longer all around although sold as a size smaller! The photo shows the difference in sizes.  Listed left to right.  ecco Vibration flat - size 38, so is: ecco Touch 25 Slide - size 38, appears quite small. ecco Offroad Lite - size 37 ecco Jab sandal - size 37   I always size down in ecco casual sandals (37/6); dressier ones choose my actual size (38/7).  Hope this is helpful.	2015-08-03

Loved them enough to want a backup pair for when mine wear out, so I reordered in July. The sandals that arrived looked much like the originals, except that the material was suede, rather than nubuck, and the color was much darker brown. I looked on Merrell's website and at other online retailers, and can't find any evidence that Merrell ever made this shoe in suede (not to mention that very dark brown), so I'm puzzled and annoyed. The only place I see images that match the shoes Amazon sent me is on eBay. (You can Google it to see the difference.)<br /><br />In any case, I very much like the nubuck pair that I bought in May. Comfortable, versatile, sturdy. A bit narrow, but that matters little because of the design. The shoe itself is great for me - I'm docking a star because I didn't get the real deal the second time around, and now I have the hassle of a return. It's a good thing Amazon makes it easy; otherwise, I'd be complaining more loudly.	2015-08-03

I took 1/2 a size down from what I normally wear and they fit perfect. They are very comfortable and so far I have used them around the house, out for some quick shopping, and a bike ride. I have high arches and these do not make my feet hurt at all. Sometimes these types of sandals are too narrow and snag/pinch my small toe, but I do not have any issues with these sandals. Quality of the materials look very durable and I hope to keep these for awhile. Great buy and will recommend.	2015-08-03

Standing all day isn't easy specially when you're wearing shoes that has no arch support. These shoes exceeding my expectation. I'm very happy with the fit. It's comfortable enough that my feet are snugged. Standing up isn't a problem with the right arch support for its size.<br /><br />The front is made out of mesh-like quality which helps my feet breathe preventing a stinky feet after a long day. The only problem that I have with it is that after using it for a couple of months, I'm starting to get holes from the mesh.

I looked and looked for a heeled loafer at a decent price.  These are very high quality and such a reasonable price.  Thank you Amazon and DV for this bargain!  The same look and feel of many more high-end brands that I tried on, but reasonable enough in price to make them a great value.  The only slight issue I had with them is that when I wore them with jeans, they absorbed the color of the jeans and had little blue marks from them on the shoes.  It didn't make a huge difference though and it wasn't dark.  I rubbed it out with a papertowel, which worked well.  I'd recommend these to anyone who wants a heeled loafer.	2015-08-03

They're as pictured, but nicer. They look really fancy. I love that they can be dressed up or dressed down, and they're really comfy. I've recently had knee issues, and heels have been difficult for me, so this is my first try at a smaller heel to get back into them, and I chose wisely. I'll be surprised if I can't wear them all day.I'm somewhere between a 7 and 8, so I ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly. Basically I'm in love with them and if they had more colors I'd buy them.<br /><br />Oh and I know what everyone was talking about with the smell!!! It was pretty crazy, but is already fading. And when I have them on it doesn't really seem noticeable. Keep in mind I also wear an intense amount of perfume.<br /><br />Highly recommend.	2015-08-03

I was worried that it might not fit right. I usually wear 9 to 9 1/2 in women's sizes and wide width. I bought size 10.

I will add an additional arch support.  For most people, the arch support in the shoe would be acceptable, but I have extremely high arches, and typically excellent shoes aren't quite adequate.  Therefore, this isn't a defect in the shoe, but in my foot.  I will enjoy them.  The first time I wore them I wore them for 12 hour shift.  My feet did well for 11 of 12 hours.

This is my third Gusti bag that I've purchased, with each purchase I get more and more impressed with these bags/purses/duffles, whatever you chose to call them. I am usually an avid Coach &#34;junkie&#34;, owning almost an entire line of products, I can honestly say that Gusti is a top contender of my choice of purses to carry other than Coach.<br /><br />I've read several reviews all referring to the &#34;smell&#34;. Let me say, THESE ARE GENUINE LEATHER PRODUCTS, THERE IS GOING TO BE A &#34;SMELL&#34; TO THEM...the &#34;smell&#34; every has negatively reviewed does dissappate over time and with use. I will caution those that have not purchased this particular line of geniune leather goods, or truly genuine leather products, yes, the &#34;smell&#34; can be overwhelming, but as I said, it does slowly subsides over time and use. Nearly every leather product that I have owned and do own has a &#34;smell&#34;, it's natural, it's always going to be there, and if you have an aversion to the &#34;smell&#34; of genuine leather, this may not be a product you'd want to purchase. Leather is the skin or hide of an animal, usually a cow, but can be goat, sheep, lamb, buffalo, deer, elk, moose, shall I keep going? The skin or hide is treated or &#34;tanned&#34;, during this process, as with any flesh, there is going to be a &#34;smell&#34;. Every skin or hide, depending on the animal produces its' own unique &#34;smell&#34;. It's a &#34;smell&#34; you either like, or dislike. Me, I personally like the &#34;smell&#34; of leathers, it's a natural product, a natural &#34;smell&#34;. All I carry are leather purses, I only wear leather shoes, my winter coats are leather, some are leather and fur. It's a matter of personal choice, personal perference, and to be honest, in my own opinion, leather products last longer, are more durable, are well worth the price, and to me, nothing beats the &#34;smell&#34; of a genuine leather product.<br /><br />This bag, like the small round Gusti that's offered at the same price, are more on the lines of a purse, carry-all, camera bag, etc...this bag isn't what I would refer to as a weekender or even an overnight bag, it's small, the dimisions are clearly stated in the description area of the advertisement, so if you're looking for a larger duffle or larger piece of luggage, you'll probably have to look through the Gusti line of products, carefully read over the dimisions, I'd even go as far as to suggest, use a measuring tape so you'll know &#34;exactly&#34; how big this or any other item is so there is no surprise or disappointment regarding how small or how big this bag is.<br /><br />The color of the bag I received is the color of a smooth decanter of scotch. It is &#34;distressed&#34;, meaning there are natural flaws in the leather, which again, in my own opinion, gives this bag character. The color will usually darken over time and with use, that is a natural process of leather. If you're expecting a perfectly dyed product, without natural flaws and mars, this isn't probably going to be a bag you'll want to purchase. I will be including pictures to show the color, the size, and the beautiful qualities this bag offers.<br /><br />This bag offers three compartments, two smaller ones and a larger one. The largest compartment is the center compartment, with each of the smaller compartment on either side. Each compartment offers dual zippers that interlock, interlocking zippers often offer the use of luggage locks, which can give an added piece of security (luggage locks are not included with this bag but can be purchased separately). The crossbody strap is wider than most crossbody straps, the straps are undetachable. The front pocket has a nice securing buckle, the buckle is metal, not cheap plastic knock offs. The quality of construction is fantastic. All seams are sewn, not glued and made to look sewn, they are actually sewn together. Very nice, durable, and quality construction.<br /><br />Overall, regardless of the negative reviews that I've read, I'm offering a review that isn't negative, that tries to provide an overview of the quality of this bag, a brief explanation of the &#34;smell&#34; that surrounds this bag, and pictures to give the potential purchasers of this bag a better idea of the size, shape, and color. A bonus that is included (at least it was included in my shipment) is a small tin of leather treatment salve and a storage bag for the bag when not in use. Shipment was right on time, it was delivered on a Sunday, by USPS, which was guaranteed by Amazon Prime when I ordered this bag. In my own honest opinion, this bag is more stunning in person than what is shown in the pictures, and with each Gusti piece I purchase in the future, I know that I am purchasing an excellent, durable, beautifully constructed, quality bag. I would recommend this bag to anyone that asks if this bag worth the under $40.00 this wonderful bag cost. I've purchased lesser quality bags for triple the cost of this bag in the past. Keep an open mind regarding the &#34;smell&#34;, it does subside over time, as with any leather product.offering a review that isn't negative, that tries to provide an overview of the quality of this bag, a brief explanation of the &#34;smell&#34; that surrounds this bag, and pictures to give the potential purchasers of this bag a better idea of the size, shape, and color.

They're cute, if not super comfortable. The back of the shoe rubs a little (common with many flats) and the top of the shoe, near my toes, also cuts into my foot a bit. I wouldn't want to walk around all day in them but for wearing around the office they're perfect. I do wish the shoes didn't have the slight shininess that comes with satin but that's just a personal preference. They fit somewhat narrow, so if you have wide feet these are probably not for you. That being said, these are great shoes for the price and I am happy with my purchase!<br /><br />Edit: After wearing these roughly three times a week for seven months, I finally threw them out...they smelled horrible! My feet do tend to stink in certain shoes, and these were one of them. It permeated the entire shoe and there was nothing I could do to get rid of the smell, so I finally had to accept that I couldn't wear them anymore. I would be sitting at my desk and able to smell my feet--not a good thing! The shoe itself was still in good shape--my only complaint was that the lining on the bottom inside had started to separate from the sole and would bunch up under my feet, which was annoying. I'm still keeping my four star rating, as the major issue with these was not actually the shoes fault, but my own feet. I won't get them again because of it but I would still recommend them to others as a cheap flat option.	2015-08-03

I use them for running errands and never worry about being too &#34;casual&#34;. Of course I love them so much right now because my feet are somewhat wider than they used to be, before getting pregnant I hardly use them.	2015-08-03

This is the 5th design that I have bought of this same purse. I first received one as a gift several years ago. The LeSportsac Kasey is exactly the same no matter what color you order it in. I can fit everything I need in this purse. It is lightweight due to small size, nylon material and no heavy metal embellishments. It also has a great adjustable strap that I wear cross body. I can fit a small silk wallet, small brush, kleenex, iPhone, chapstick and several misc items in this purse. If you don't want shoulder pain or to struggle with a bulky purse, this is the purse for you. It comes in a variety of patterns and colors.	2015-08-03

I have to buy the large (9-10) and they fit perfectly. My toes go to the end of the slipper but they are not tight at all. They never shrink in the wash either:)!!	2015-08-03

I got these shoes in hopes that their design would solve the problem I have always had of the tounge of my shoe falling to one side. Because these shoes don't really have a tounge because they are all one piece they definitely did the trick. They are comfortable and look really cool with a pair of dark jeans cuffed up. I constantly get compliments on them and love that they are light and for fitted to my feet to the point sometimes it doesn't feel like I have shoes on. The soles of these shoes also flex amazingly unlike a cheap running shoe would.<br /><br />I do have to say though that due to their integrated tounge design they have two problems:<br />1.) When I am inactive and wearing these and my heart rate is normal they cut off circulation to my feet and my feel get numb. This is because they are tight around the ankle area and top of the foot.<br />2.)Again because of the tightness around the ankle they can be difficult to squeeze on. I have partially broken the backs of them getting my feet into them. They have loops on the back like most shoes, but one of mine has torn off due to the force put on it when pulling the shoes on.	2015-08-03

Great shoes, air max is the only shoe i will buy. i spend 98% of my time in steel toe work boots, these are barely noticeable on my feet. the only downside to the mesh design is winter/cold weather use. i can usually get several years out of a pair, i dont do much running in them. my last pair lost the air in the soles but the shoes themselves were still in pretty good shape.	2015-08-03

The strap will not be long enough & you will have to pay to return shoes that will not fit	I have wide feet.  (E)  I always have to buy larger sizes so that they'll fit the width of my foot.  The base of these shoes is as expected unfortunately the strap is not long enough for the shoe to get on my foot easily.  Once it was on my foot it pinched, right away.  And it was at the 'end of the strap'.<br /><br />These are cute shoes and if the strap was longer I likely would have loved them and given them 5 stars because the soles seemed comfy for the minute or two I was testing them out.  I also downgraded a star because they did not give me free shipping to return these shoes but are making me pay for a shoe that did not fit.  That's pretty lame.	2015-08-03

I like these shoes a lot because they are very extremely comfortable. It feels like wearing a very padded soft cloudy sock! However, I have only had them for four months and some of the painted black stripe on the sole has worn off (though I do wear these every single day). Also, the shoe is advertised to have something to prevent foot odors, but if I don't wear socks my feet still get smelly ... I still have to wear socks. I have washed these once in the washing machine and they came out looking great. They also make a funny suction cup unpopping sound when I walk on lab flooring, but that does not bother me.<br /><br />EDIT: The sound my shoe makes when walking on the lab floors are actually annoying. I would not recommend these shoes if you work in a lab setting or anywhere where the floor is coated with that sheen that makes it easy to wipe up spills.. It's embarrassing when people hear me coming and I only wear these shoes now If I know I will be in the office for most of the day.<br /><br />I bought a size 7 when I usually wear a 7.5. The only other size 7 shoes I have are Clarks which I also think run large.	2015-08-03

I know you can draw in the laces tighter but with the leather being so soft I wouldn't want to pull them in too tight.  Also the leather looked somewhat ashy in comparison to the photo....its the type of soft leather than you can easily scratch it by even lightly rubbing your nail against it. I wouldn't suggest constant wear mainly because the leather will wear out fast...I've had soft leather shoes before and try to avoid them because of this. I returned them even though they were over 30% off.	2015-08-03

When the shoes arrived, they did seem a little small, but once I wore them in a little, the size is great. The reason for the 4 stars is, although they are super comfortable, it is rather easy to twist your ankle. The adjustable strap is very nice because as the shoes get more worn in, you can tighten them up. All-in-all, they are comfortable, stylish and I would buy this brand again	2015-08-03

The handle to one of the boots broke as we put it on my daughter. Now, as she was eager to wear them, she started to cry. Then I told her maybe we needed to send them back for a replacement, and it was the end of the world. I just tried to glue the broken part as best I could, because there was no talking the 4 year old out of wearing them. I know these are kids' boots, but they shouldn't break as they are being tried on. I've bought Western Chief boots before, Hello Kitty ones no less, and they were more durable. I guess their quality is declining, so it's probably the last pair for us.	2015-08-03

Like so many before, I wanted a pair of wayfarers, but could not afford premium prices.  I tried a pair of ZeroUVs, but they were too dark.  After reading what others thought of these, I pulled the trigger, and I am glad I did.  The tint is just right, dark enough to minimize the sun, but not so dark that I can't see.  They also fit perfectly.  I would give it five stars, but my pair came with some sort of factory defect on the lower left corner of the left lense.  I can best describe it as a bubble in the tint.  That said, it does not affect my field of vision, so I'm keeping them.  Definitely worth the extra three bucks and I recommend these without hesitatition	2015-08-03

Nothing bad about it, just take .5 size bigger. I have a 7.5, I fit perfectly in a 8. I read previous reviews and ordered an 8, and they are perfect... 7.5 would not have fit.<br /><br />For the shoes themselves, you get what you paid for. I'm not saying this as a critic.. just a truth. Great casual shoes, really cheap.<br />Not 5stars because they look plastic-ish, so I bet they would smell pretty fast (even if they are light and your feet can breathe a lot in them), and since they are kinda cheap, I would not put them in the washer like I do with other shoes, but need to wash them on the sink which is annoying and less efficient.<br /><br />YAY :) They are good shoes, really comfortable, good for walking in like paved / really good roads / trails, stay home, go groceries, or go to school/work on a casual day. Given they are only $25, they do an awesome job for these activities. This is what I got the shoes for, so I'm happy.<br />NAY :( If you are committed about running, and plan to use them frequently and for a long time, or if you are looking for some hiking shoes, this just are not good enough. I'd suggest to pay the money Nike asks for.	2015-08-03

They are wide enough for my duck feet but not sloppy in the heel. There is good arch support. I like that the sole comes up a bit in front because I am forever scuffing the front of my walking shoes. What I don't like is the gray sole. It looks black in the photo but it is a dark gray. What is it with Ecco and their strange colored soles?

I have a pair I got from Nordstrom about 4 years ago. Unfortunately the arm broke off and I lost it.  I was finally able to make another investment and purchase these again because I loved them so much, and I was thrilled when I found them almost $100 cheaper on amazon. Even though there are some bad reviews, for the most part they are good. I purchased them and received them same day. I was sooo excited! Then I opened the box and immediately knew something was off. The creaking is horrible and they are definitely lighter than my other pair. The arms have a seam down the middle which my real pair does not have, and one arm doesn't touch when placed on a flat surface. It is the best knockoff I've ever seen, so I don't know whether to just keep them and save the $100 (because no one else will know) or send them back to get a real pair from SGH or Nordstrom. Someone had a good point in their review saying that RayBan backs up the authenticity of any glasses sold by Amazon and that they are an authorized dealer...but they might have found a way to make 2 different sets. The internet discounted ones and the high end brick and mortar sunglasses. China vs Italy... It's a shame. I was really looking forward to these and now I'm torn.	2015-08-03

Because of the minimal toe coverage and being semi-narrow; you most definitely need to order a size up. I was also concerned when ordering, that the crocodile print might be a black outline in the crevices and bright blue in the center, to give the crocodile effect - However, the imprinted shoe is in fact a solid navy, without any color illusions. If you have long toes, you WILL have toe cleavage. If you have short toes order a size up; you should have full coverage. I also recommend purchasing shoe cushions, for long-term comfort, as you WILL want to wear these classic beauties as much as possible.<br />**Customer service is of the highest quality, very accommodating - and kind.	2015-08-03

If I tighten them across the foot it leaves to much length on the buckle end and I can't tighten them enough around his ankle.  The leftover tab is also super long and drags on the ground.  I tucked it into the loop on the back but that makes it a pain to take them off.  These were recommended by our doctor for a flat foot issue and I think they would be great for someone with a wider foot and thicker ankles.	2015-08-03

I have another pair I purchased at a local store that are the same size.  These are too small and the others fit great.  Both pairs state that they are 8w- 10m.  I didn't choose to reorder at this time b/c I'm not sure I will end up with a pair that actually fits the way they are suppose to with their current stock.<br /><br />Otherwise I love these shoes.  The one problem with them is that they heat up quickly.  This does make your feet sweat, which I can live with.  The real downside to the heat is that they attract dirt and dust.  After wearing my other pair around the house for a few hours I end up with lots of debris in the heel and toe area.  It is very strange.  I have worn other brands of foam type shoes, i.e. Crocks, LLBean, etc and this has never happened before.	2015-08-03

The shape fits my face particularly well and these don't slide down my nose.<br /><br />These are lightweight (presumably because of the plastic construction).  They come with a hard-sided case to keep them from getting squashed, and they also come with a microfiber cloth that will be perfect for cleaning the lenses without scratching them.<br /><br />The sunglasses and case did NOT have a plastic smell when I opened the package (I have had issues with this lately, with some other products, so I like to point out when items don't smell, as well).

The shoes is sized as expected (based on size charts) but I've noticed that Pediped shoes tend to run a little wider than other brands (like Robeez), so we have a little bit of extra room in that aspect. That wasn't a huge surprise to me though because we've had other shoes in this brand before. We accepted the extra width because I love the sole of the shoe. It is very flexible, but still feels thick enough to provide a little bit more protection from pokes when walking on uneven surfaces. The toe of the shoe is very tough also, so imagine that it would hold up well if your child is still primarily crawling (ours walks so can't say for sure).<br /><br />I was pleased to find that the shoe opened up better than I expected, making it easier to put on. The strap is only permanently attached on one side of the shoe and then attaches with Velcro to both the top/middle of the shoe and the other side. This also allows a little more flexibility on how tight the shoe is around the ankle. I was a little nervous about them rubbing based on other reviews, but have found that we don't have a problem with it. Our son is pretty small (3rd percentile), but I am careful to make sure that I don't Velcro the ankle strap too tight. I have noticed that he sometimes will have a small red mark on his ankle after wearing, but it goes away shortly after taking off the shoe, much like the elastic in a sock ankle can sometimes leave a temporary mark. When wearing with socks, I don't notice any marks, but they could be hidden by the sock itself and/or masked by the sock marks. Either way, because it doesn't seem to bother him and it goes away quickly, I am not worried about it.	2015-08-03

This review is for irish dancers specifically, the extra room may work for other types of dance, but it will just make your hard shoe practice look and feel sloppy. I have not danced in them other than to try them on, and I will probably resell them, so I don't know about the durability.

I own many pairs of Tom's. I have boney wide feet and my shoe size is normally 8 or 8 1/2  but I guess not.  In Toms, If I want to wear socks I buy 7 1/2, no socks size 7.  In Bob's I bought a 7 1/2.  They are HUGE and wide. Thank goodness for shoe inserts. Bob's have a thicker sole then Tom's with a tiny bit more support. The lace on this pair is not uncomfortable.  Bob's are a bit less expensive then Tom's and they also provide shoes for the shoeless.  I like that!...... I THINK I could wear a 6 1/2.. I may buy another pair.	2015-08-03

Purchased these are reading other reviews that described them as having wonderful support and walking on a cloud. Those points were not my experience. Yes, they have the foam footbed. No, they don't provide much arch support at all. And the foam didn't feel very cushy at all (at least for me). Also, I have another pair of Ryka shoes (Devotion) in a size 8 that fit just fine. Because other reviews said the Cloud runs small, I bought an 8.5. Nope. Would've needed the 9. Makes no sense for the same brand of shoe to vary so much in sizing from one style to the next.

I just got these shoes so I can't comment on how well they will hold up over time. So far they seem reasonably comfortable.  The only thing strange about them is how narrow the middle of the shoe sole is.  I don't have particularly wide feet and I ordered the same size I have always bought in Nine West shoes, but the sides of my feet are just hanging off the edge.  I have a hard time believing anyone's feet are this narrow.	2015-08-03

I love the fit and feel.  For fitness, I used to run and wear running shoes but now, as I'm getting older (late 50s), I try to walk as much as I can every day.  My goal is to walk 5 miles a day and I'd say I come pretty close to that.  So my point is I walk a lot in these shoes.  My concern is I don't get full use out of these shoes due to poor bonding of the glue between the sole and shoe body.  Every single pair has failed in the exact same way.  The bottom separates from the body at/near the toe area then the separation gradually gets worse until the whole sole is separated down to the middle of my foot.  At that point, I throw them away and buy another pair.  I haven't tried gluing the sole back to the body as I've seen in other reviews.  The shoes fail at about the 4-5 month point for me.  Given my walking habits, that's perhaps 500 to 600 miles walked.  So I can't fault the shoe entirely.  That's a lot of miles!  But I do think New Balance should recognize this defect and use better glue.  I'd like to wear a hole in a pair or have the sole wear thin just once instead of watching what looks like a perfectly good pair of shoes come unglued!  My plan is to try another brand of walking shoe when the pair I have fails ... the soles are already starting to separate ... again!	2015-08-03

I'm giving it three stars because they appear to be very well-made. But I'm taking off a star for styling and another star  for when I consider a poor weather weave design.

The reviews said they were a bit small, so I ordered a half size bigger than what she normally wears. That was a good call. They fit great. She like how light they are, while still feeling sturdy. A lot of the new shoes that are light are too much like walking without shoes. She has a moderate arch, some shoes arches are too big and end up making her feet ache. These have a good arch for her feet. The toe curves upward which is great for cross training activities. They give great support even if she is lifting and she can jump on the treadmill right after. Over all, she loves these shoes and has had over success with New Balance.	2015-08-03

It got me to some nice places in comfort, kept my feet dry, and did well.  But LONG before the soles got too worn, the soles started to separate from the boot!

A friend of mine with the same boot had the exact same problem (hers completely came off during a hike, and had to use duct tape to hold it on for the trail out!  I went here and see there are others with the separation problem - and it looks like this happens all too often - this is not acceptable!  I would be OK if the soles wore out, but not this...

My old pair were about through, and found these on sale, so I bought a new pair.  First time I laced the new pair up, one of the upper lace grommets snapped off.  Not a good start.<br /><br />The ankle-area is very stiff, but low.  Very stiff is good in a taller boot; it provides ankle support.  In a low-ankle boot like this, it's just simply uncomfortable.

You just have to get the right size.<br />I wear a size 7 1/2 but in Grazie I wear an 8 1/2 or 9. They run a little larger compared to your normal shoe size so be aware of that.

The zippers are smooth.  I use the outer zipped pocket for my iPhone 5s with its bulky Lifeproof case.  (It could easily fit a bigger phone.)  The inner zipped pocket is perfect for my ID and a couple of credit cards, passport and maybe some cash, though I hardly use cash.  And it's zippered so I don't have to worry about anything falling out.  The main pocket holds my eyeglass case, and some essentials like a fingernail clipper, eye drops, etc.  It could hold a paperback, but I doubt it could hold the paperback and my bulky eyeglass case together.  The strap can be doubled up and used as a shoulder bag, or slung single and used cross-body, which is what I like.  The colors are fun and go with everything in my wardrobe.  And Sakroots is a great company and give a portion of every purchase to varying non-profits.	2015-08-03

If you can wear other pointed shoes, you should be able to handle these.  Sometimes, I am not able to wear them, due to swelling feet due to thyroid issues.  When that happened, it was mostly tight across the tops of the feet.  The patent leather is tight, so there is not stretch and give in that area.  But, I think the shoe is mostly true to size and fit.  I do not think the toe part is very rounded, so if you need that additional space, you might want another style of shoe.  These are not very high-heeled, and have been perfect to wear for lots of walking due to business interviews.  Also, the bow is a little different than I have seen, so it is unique in a good way.	2015-08-03

I am a long time lover of KEEN shoes. This would have been my 4th pair in a few years. I usually fit a size 9 women's keen shoe and so I ordered both the 9 and 9.5 sizes with free return policy. BOTH had too narrow a toe box. I found the size 9.5 fit better overall, comparable to the size 9 in other Keen styles like the Flint shoe. ORDER 1/2 SIZE LARGER than usual in your Keen size but be aware that the TOE BOX IS MUCH NARROWER than other Keen shoes. For this reason I returned them. Back to the more klunky appearance of my Keen Flints that I live in! They are fabulous. These shoes the Marshall WP shoe, look more feminine but I miss the adequate toe box that previous KEEN shoes provided.	2015-08-03

I bought boots that were way more expensive and was always unsatisfied and came back from hiking trips with sore feet and terrible blisters. Every pair of shoes/boots gave me blisters!! But I read the reviews here and gave them a shot - and after over a year of heavy use, not a single blister and soo much comfort. I take them hiking, roadtrips, and whenever I'm going on long walks.<br />The grip may not be as good and they are not waterproof, but I will happily sacrifice that for the comfort and flexibility they offer! :)	2015-08-03

I even wear them to work at the office, we have a casual dress code, and they look and feel way nicer than the cheap flip flops.  I wear a size 7 1/2 or 7, depending on the shoe style/brand. I ordered this pair in a size 7, and they fit perfectly. They do come a bit longer.  Also, it's a very nice color, and the width is adjustable velcro. I think a lot of people buy their shoes way too small. You have to consider your foot size, which you can have measured at a shoestore. Remember, one foot might be longer/shorter than the other, so  you always go with the larger size to accomodate the longer foot. Your feet should feel comfortable, the shoe shouldn't hurt your foot.	2015-08-03

The sole is very flexible and the leather is supple enough so that they have required virtually no &#34;breaking in&#34; time. I've been wearing them comfortably since I received them. Generally, I prefer men's boots because I tend to be hard on shoes and men's shoes seem to hold up better for me. I got these in an 8.5 EE because that's the size that was on sale ridiculously cheap (over 40% off--just one more thing to love about them) even though I had some concern that they'd be clown-shoe wide, but the width was perfect, too, and they didn't &#34;look&#34; overly wide.

The cut by the ankle is extremely low, more of a fashion sneaker than an actual skate sneaker.  I feel like if I needed to ever exert myself (say, run) they'll fly right off, so skating is most likely out of the question.  The fit of the shoe overall is just fine, the quality is typical for the type of shoe it is.  Only gripe is this:  nothing from the images or description give you the warning that the inside of the shoe has a picture of a skull and weed leaf.  I just put an insert in the shoe for arch support and to cover the image, but really?  Unnecessary and somewhat stupid, especially given that the shoe itself gives you no indication that it's going to have some teenager friendly print on the inside of it.  Overall, it's irrelevant, but certainly unexpected.	2015-08-03

My feet slipped off in size 38 and I couldn't run or even go upstairs without tiptoeing. And I also found that heavy socks wouldn't work either since my feet could still slip off a little bit even though the socks had already been super tight in the boots. So sizing down became the only option for me. Size 37 fit fine in length and width but left no room for regular socks. Luckily it provided enough room for thin socks which both kept the sweat off my feet and prevented the rubbing of my feet against the leather. I am happy with the smaller size.	2015-08-03

I'm very pleased with them all around. When I brought them in to my eyeglass store to have the prescription lenses put in, the old school opticians/optometrist at MOSCOT commented on what good quality the frames were and he has nothing to gain by doing so as I didn't buy them from him. In addition to these being good quality frames they are a real value for their price point. I would highly recommend these glasses to anyone who likes their look/style.	2015-08-03

I just love them. They come in a very nice wood box which is a great way to protect your glasses. In addition they have a protective, sheer drawstring bag which protects your investment. Gowood has many styles to fit your lifestyle and taste. The frame, hinges and glasses are of high quality. I also own a pair of Ray-Ban but I have to say that I got the same quality from a pair of GOWOOD glasses at half the price.  Don't hesitate! these glasses are light and trendy and you don't need to spend a fortune to get them.	2015-08-03

I was afraid the leather would take a little breaking in at the toe, so I took another pair of sandels with me the first time I wore them, but I never took them off.  They were comfortable all day, and I've worn them several times since--even got 2 compliments on them so far! The only thing I would change is to make the heel wider at the floor for more stability, but I can't fault the shoe for that, I knew it would be narrower than the footbed before I bought  them, thanks to the great pictures. They can be dressed up or down too--a big plus. I love the height they give me without killing my feet since I can't wear heels anymore after 6 back surgeries. I bought the black in a 7 1/2 and the length was perfect.	2015-08-03

I was looking for a roomy, lightweight case with exterior pockets (specifically a pocket big enough for documents, magazines, etc). Most of the time my only luggage is my carry-on even on extended international trips so durability was also very important.  This bag fulfilled most of my criteria, but ultimately was not the right one for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lightweight<br />-Durable Kipling nylon<br />-Can pack a whole lot<br />-Multiple interior compartments<br />-Multiple exterior pockets<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Duffle straps are an inconvenience when you need to access the main compartment quickly. I understand this is &#34;duffle&#34; bag, but due to the dimensions I would have been wheeling this most of time (if not all the time)<br />-Exterior pockets are small; good for toiletries and packing a lot of smaller items. My personal preference is to have a large exterior compartment.<br />-2-wheels; this is also a matter of personal preference but I found the Discover less smooth and less maneuverable than the Darcey spinner<br />-Seems a tad larger than standard carry-on, especially if it were completely packed.<br /><br />I did not attempt to actually pack the bag so cannot speak to the stability issues when standing upright, but I can see how that could be an issue with such a lightweight bag that is sitting on 2-wheels.	2015-08-03

Overall: These shoes are FLAT with a very small rise to the heel. These are powerlifting shoes (I wear them for squats and deadlifts) but I could see them becoming daily shoes for people who like Chucks but want an updated design. I'm on the verge of ordering several pairs for daily wear to keep these clean for the gym.  My Reebok Crossfit Lite TR (7 Mens) compared to my Converse Chucks (7.5 Mens): Reeboks shoes have a wider toe area that doesn't squish my foot. Reebok's heel is skinnier and has more support (thicker material). Reebok has a padded tongue so you can go looser with the laces and they don't want to flop off. Reebok has &#34;proper length&#34; laces compared to Chucks where I'm double-knotting just so they don't drag on the ground.  I also have a 7.5 pair of Reebok Lite TR high tops but they are too long. Turns out the extra .5 size in Chucks I wear is specifically to get the extra width I need. No worries, the 7.5 Reeboks are in the closet until winter when thicker socks can take up the slack.  UPDATE: I bought a size 7.5 in the low top and they fit perfectly. Maybe the high tops I got were over-sized... Either way, I wear these as everyday shoes now.	2015-08-03

I bought these in silver for my 16 mos old daughter who wears an infant size 4 at the moment. She has a very typical foot for her age, not too wide and not too narrow. I purchased them in size 19 (US 4-4.5). They are gorgeous, genuine leather upper & sole and so well made which is so rare these days. However, it seems that this particular style runs about a half to one full size small as I could not get my daughter's foot fully through the front part of the sandal . This is the one and only reason I knocked one star off. I have yet to try one size up.	2015-08-03

I got a half size smaller than my norm due to a large difference in the price (the price for the size 8 1/2 was way higher than the price for the size 8). I was unable to get any help on the Ralph Lauren website on how  these particular shoes ran in size (i.e big or small). So my plan was to return them should the 8 not fit upon arrival. But to amazement they fit perfectly. Not to mention they look and fit so cute. I LOVE THEM!!!	2015-08-03

They have good arch support, too. This is my second pair, however, since my first pair broke where the plastic connects to the foot bed in between the toes. It eventually weakens and then rips off. Standing in water while in these shoes also stretches the plastic out. The other downfall of these flip flops is that they also are prone to &#34;catching&#34; when you walk and the front-most part bends as your foot proceeds to extend forward as you walk (and a bit of a trip). As a result of this, my periwinkle is scuffed with black on the front-most part under the toes. This &#34;catching&#34; also stretches out the bond of the connector piece that attaches to the foot bed, thus weakening it. I'll get black if I buy another pair to avoid this unsightly issue; but then I'd be out another $45...<br /><br />Oofos needs to engineer a sturdier connection point in between the toes to the foot bed to make these last longer. Very comfortable when they are not broken.	2015-08-03

I have bunions, so was a little nervous about reviews saying these are narrow. I thought I'd take a chance, as I could return them.  They are stretchy enough that my bunions are not a problem.  I have also found that they are easy to slip on barefoot, for a quick trip to take the dog out.  I need more ankle support as I get older, and had looked at some more expensive hiking boots that zipped up, thinking they'd be easier to quickly put on and off, but thought I'd start with these because the ratings were so good.  I can slip my feet in these easily and just quickly tie them.  When I'm going to go for a serious walk, I can lace them up more tightly.  But, these have exceeded all of my expectation.  They were also really comfortable right out of the box.  The ankle support is not quite as good as a heavier hiking boot, but good enough, and I love that they're much lighter than my old hiking boots.  I'd buy these again in a heartbeat.  Oh, and I went with my normal size of a 9.5, and they are perfect with or without socks.  I don't wear really thick socks, though.  But, I disagree that you have to buy these more than a 1/2 size bigger, and only then would I do so if you use thick socks, in my opinion.	2015-08-03

I got these shoes for my husband because he has another pair in a different color. However these don't fit exactly like the other ones, a little snug. They are great material and a beautiful shoe. I am trying to get him to wear them more, or see if I can stretch them because it may just be a new feel and they need to stretch a bit, since we didn't have this problem before.	2015-08-03

Well I have had these shoes for just over a month (so unfortunately I cannot return them) and all the rubber is falling off the bottom. I can't make the return through the site but I've emailed the seller through their site and I will also be contacting asics. If they are able to help me out I will change the review but as of now these shoes are falling apart the way I would expect a cheap Chinese knockoff too.	2015-08-03

After ordering 2 pairs with defects, I gave up on this boot. Major quality control issues. The first pair had a gash of leather taken out of the side of the boot. The second pair's sole was coming off from the inside heal, causing a loud noise &#34;pop&#34; every time I took a step. With the second pair, a gash was also taken out of the leather on the other boot. I don't think I'll risk a third pair.  I hope the company is listening to these reviews.	2015-08-03

The shoes are very flat inside but I pull out all of the insoles in sneakers and add better ones anyway and there was no problem doing that with this pair of shoes. It made them fit better. I normally do not wear socks in sneakers but the placement of the stiff leather Adidas tag on the tongue made them rub the top of my ankle without socks. I added a light sock and problem solved. My shoes came with a coral colored lace- I am going to switch them out for white- personal preference. Overall for less than $20 a solid value! With some minor fussing which I do anyway they are comfy and cute and are a well made shoe.  Would have given 5 stars if they had come with 2 sets of laces like most sneakers do. They are a subdued pink and not too bubblegum for someone in the 'over 40' group :)	2015-08-03

These boots are very comfortable. It is difficult to fond something in a wide boot that is not plain. But the lace up back on these is fun! Theya re good quality. I think they were both wider an longer than other wide boots I purchased this year. I wish the heel was higher, which would make them dressier, that is why I gave them 4, not 5 stars.

They are very pretty sandals, the picture does not do them enough justice. I was so excited to wear them when I opened the box and saw them. The sole of the shoe is plush-- almost enough to make up for the lack of arch support. However, they ended up disappointing me a little. I wore them to the mall, and when I got back home, I had a huge blister on my right foot from where the strap was rubbing on the inner top of my foot; there is still a little scab, and I wore them over a week ago, and have not worn them since. I tend to have blister trouble with some sandals, but this is the first time that Aerosoles has let me down.	2015-08-03

Fits great - especially if you have a wide foot.  I have problems with my knee, but since I have started wearing Sketchers Go Walk shoes, my knee problem has just disappeared.  It must be the excellent cushion on the bottom of the shoe. They act as a shock absorber. They are extremely comfortable and lightweight. And there is no impact on the knee.  A winner! I own 5 pairs and will keep buying more...	2015-08-03

I have a desk job so I do not do much walking during the work day.  Even with the little bit of movement, by lunchtime, I have bruises on both big toes where the straps intersect.  They are not tight and are not uncomfortable in that area so I would not have thought this would be an issue but it happens every time I wear the shoes.  I wear many different sandals and my feet do not bruise like this with any other shoes.	2015-08-03

US	9933342	R3Q35M61N64R3Q	B00NJH7OW8	990379075	Teva Women's Original Sandal	Shoes	3	1	1	N	N	Design problems with length of ankle strap (too short) and foot strap (too long).	Generally a good shoe for the river/lake/beach or walking around in. Good quality polyester uppers. Rubber bottoms are ok (I've had mine about 2 mos and they have a gauge in them from getting caught on something I don't remember). Textured footbed is great, helps keep you from slipping when walking in water. Was a little scratchy for a day or two but comfy after that. Shoe feels too big in the strap across the foot closest to the toes- there is so much room the shoe drags/scrapes the sidewalk often enough to be annoying when lifting your foot to walk. Conversely the ankle strap is either way too short or the straps connecting the ankle strap to the sole are too short...if the strap was actually around the ankle the size would be fine, but because it is below the ankle bone, that's a pretty wide place, and I have average-size ankles. Because the straps are too short (there is about a 1/2 inch - 1 inch of exposed velcro), when you sit with your ankles crossed and then uncross them, the exposed sticky velcro has attached itself to the decorative polyester upper ankle strap on the front of the other shoe, pilling and fuzzing a material that should otherwise be durable. I bought the mosaic vintage indigo and like the color. Maybe teva should consider some beta testing and have some people wear the shoe before manufacturing a zillion of them with such an inherent flaw? I have mixed feelings on this shoe- comfortable but the cost implies better execution.	2015-08-03

Full disclosure, I am a Mizuno running shoe fan and have been for 20 years.  These shoes are light and fast.  They provide excellent support for my arch.  I went from running in Mizuno Wave Rider 15s, which seemed to get better the more I wore them.  I wore those out and now I have the WR 18s.  I cannot wait to see where these take me!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />PS:  I am a larger runner at 5'11'' 205lbs and these shoes provide tremendous stability without sacrificing weight or flexibility.  I wore my 15s for a year before replacing them only because they stunk too badly to keep in the house!<br /><br />The 18s are great shoes.  Plus, I get a lot of compliments because they are good looking kicks<br /><br />.	2015-08-03

The sandals are a gorgeous vibrant orange color that is still sophisticated. And the design is flattering and sexy but keeps your foot snug on all sides. Unfortinately the footbed was SO hard and inflexible! I felt like I was wearing wooden clogs. Now, I must say that I do have VERY picky feet and high arches so usually I buy expensive comfort sandals from Born and Clarks so may be I am too spoiled. But I didn't think I could wear this for more than an hour. Also, I was scared I'd twist my ankle in them as I felt a bit unstable. The wedge tapers down in the back quite a bit and they are overall very high so if you are not used to wearing tall thinner heels these might be scary for you. I have never worn skinny high heels. But I can manage well-made thicker heels and these did not feel safe for me at all. In short, despite being a wedge they felt like a regular heel to me. Combined with the hard footbed I just did not think I would wear them much so I returned them. However, IF you don't have picky arches AND are comfortable in regular high heels and are not intimidated by 3.5in height do give these a try as in terms of style they are to die for.	2015-08-03

In fact, they are the only flat flop flips that I purchase now...and I grew up in Hawaii where flip flops are a way of life!!!  Thus, I consider myself a flip flop connoisseur! So, why Sperry? 1. They are consistently true to size. 2. The quality of the shoe is excellent. 3. The color does not come off on my foot (this is a big problem for me with cheap flip flops). 4. They last. I bought my first pair 3 years ago and still have them and wear them. I live in flip flops as much as possible so they &#34;get a beating and keep on ticking&#34; ...  okay, they don't tick! 5. I have high arches and these shoes are very comfortable but I think any type of arch would be fine in these flip flops. 6. They are washable. 7. I don't feel the earth. In cheap flip flops I could feel every pebble; the cushion on the Sperry protects your feet. Finally, I own 6 pairs of their flip flops and 2 pairs of their loafers. I absolutely love them all. I have never had a blister. The first time.e that I wore them they felt like a pair of old comfy shoes!	2015-08-03

The outside of the fabric is a material kind of like nylons, but a bit tougher and I must have caught it on somethings as it has a large whole in it now.  The shoe has a thicker, tougher fabric underneath so I can still wear them, they just don't look as nice.	2015-08-03

The polarization works as well as much more expensive glasses I have purchased, and they look almost as good as well. I bought them after mistaking them for Ray Bans on a friend, and now multiple people have asked me &#34;Are those Ray Bans?&#34; My response: &#34;Ray Bans? Peh. These are Jimartis, brother! If you don't know Jimarti, you don't know jack.&#34;<br /><br />I've lost a lot of friends this way.<br /><br />They did break a bit when I stepped on them, but I would say that's more my fault. My friend's pair eventually broke in the same way, though, and he did not step on them. In both cases, the little nose clippy thing fell off, but mine still rest on my nose pretty comfortably.<br /><br />Overall, for $40, they're a great value. If you're like me, and you lose or step on a lot of your sunglasses, this is a good pair to buy that you won't hate to replace.	2015-08-03

If I got the next size up (11.5) then the shoe would have been too long.  I usually get size 11 and the shoe stretches out a bit.  The only problem with Tretorn shoes (I've only bought Skymra slip-on types) is that the soul detaches too soon from the shoe (about 6 months in an office environment, no running, no sports, no outdoor use).  I use super glue to put it back together but that only lasts about a few weeks.  I still love the style of the shoe.	2015-08-03

I ordered 2 pairs of these glasses. The first pair had a glue/white residue on the bottom corner of the lens/frame. I decided to return them in exchange for a second pair, but that pair was even worse, with both corners of the lens/frame with this glue/white residue. I have other Oakley glasses that I purchased at the Oakley Store and have never had any quality control issues with them. I believe these glasses being sold are some sort of high end fake. If they are not, then Oakley has some sort of quality control issues that they need to get a hold of. I was going to try for a 3rd pair to see if that does the charm, but Amazon contacted me and said they will no longer be selling this product until they do an investigation. Other than the glue/white residue the glasses were great. It's too bad, as I wasted so much time.	2015-08-03

I have worn sandals and flip flops all my life and wear them daily since I live in a warm climate.  I have also stubbed my big toe more times than I care to remember...UNTIL I found these KEEN sandals, they have a small rubber &#34;Toe Saver&#34; for the big toe and I haven't stubbed my big old toe in the past few years.  The sandals are very well made, with great arch support (better than most any &#34;regular&#34; sandal) and the rubber construction serves very well as a walking shoe that allows me to wander onto the beach without worrying about them failing - I've lost a KEEN before, but I have never worn one out.  So, these sandals cost a bit more, but the construction and BIG TOE SAVER are well worth the money...buy em, you won't regret it.	2015-08-03

I had to send the shoes back and get a 1/2 size smaller before it was right.  Once I got the right size, these shoes ROCK!  I am very satisfied with the design of these shoes and the overall sense of durability.  Right out of the box they seemed a better investment than the Brooks Adrenaline which I previously owned.

The jelly tends to scuff easily, and the bottom part is made of a foam material. I wore them to a three day event and the foam platform started to crack at the ball of the foot, which it eventually cracked all the way across. I had some E6000 glue (industrial strength stuff), so I used it to glue it back together and it's came apart again. The tan material on top is what is holding the shoe together now. The jelly does clean easily though, and I get complimented on the shoes quite often. They're comfortable for quite a while, but towards the end of the day the jelly starts to get irritating. Overall I'm happy with them tough. I mean, I can't get upset when I only paid $15. If I'd paid $50 it'd be another story.	2015-08-03

Today I went for a hike on trails in them , they make me much more stable & your toes grip the ground & your feet feel the ground like they are meant to . I usually wear a size 81/2 & ordered size 40 & they fit great they mold to my feet like a glove once I got the hang of putting then on it gets easier & easier .

Unfortunately there is no arch support and they hurt my feet within minutes of putting them on. I am not putting the rating down for this however, as I have foot problems, but don't expect the same amount of comfort as other Crocs shoes. The silver part in the middle is a very bland color and the paint has already scratched on mine. Again, I wore them for 5 minutes and put them on the shoe rack-so they probably came scratched. I still like the shoes however, so hopefully I will fix my feet and be able to wear them next summer.	2015-08-03

But it seems that the inside sole of the shoe has some glue to hold it down.  I found this to be a problem after wearing the shoe for awhile with a thin ped on my foot.  Couldn't get my ped out as it was glued to the shoe.  Had to literally pull it out on both shoes.  Wore the shoe without anything else on my foot and the glue got on my feet.  Made the insert inside move also.  So while these shoes are comfy and I really liked them, I unfortunately cant say they are too good as I've ruined several pairs of peds pulling them out of the glue in the shoes, and have glue inside the shoe making it not real possible to wear them barefoot.  I've had these for a fairly short time and probably they aren't going to be making it through the summer.  Bummer.	2015-08-03

I have the multi-colored-floral ones and the red, white, and blue ones. People who see them for the first time always comment positively about them. My findings are that I wear a size 7 1/2 Medium, and have ordered shoes online for years and never had to return a pair. Having read on several sites that they run a bit large, I ordered size 7, and length-wise they fit perfectly. However, the Z-straps are somewhat loose, and there's no real arch support. I expected the width of the straps would run smaller, since I was ordering a half size shorter than what I normally wear, but this is not the case. They fit me somewhat loose, so I can't wear them over a couple of hours or they start rubbing my feet. However, I read here that some people think they run small, so that means there is poor quality control at the factory in China. This is a real downer, and no doubt costs Dawgs some revenue by people who don't want to deal with returns, as they aren't free, like they are on most shoe sites. I, myself, went on this site to order another pair in a solid color this time, but I won't, as I'm afraid I might get a pair that is too large, too small, or too short. All of these have been listed as complaints here. My opinion is that, if you take a 1/2 size shoe, then order a size down (as I did), and if you have a wide foot or high instep, they will probably fit you very comfortably. But if you normally take a medium or narrow width shoe, then you probably will be unhappy with them. Medium will be loose and narrow won't do at all. If you want to take a 'Dawgs Roulette' shot at fit, then by all means order them. They're cute and reasonably comfortable, but wish I could buy the Canadian version, as I've read here that the footbed is smooth and more comfortable than the 'pebbly' USA ones.	2015-08-03

I like the style, but I had to return it and get a bigger size. I'm usually a 7.5 in all Steve Madden shoes, but this shoe was to tight and narrow for me. Change it for an 8 and it does fit better but then it looks and feels quite big around the ankle. I must say my feet are pretty wide and maybe that's why they didn't fit as expected, if you also have wide feet go half a size up.  Hopefully I won't have any accidents while wearing them.	2015-08-03

I was wearing them with inserts at first so that I could wear them bear foot, but that made them too small and they hurt even more so I had to stop using the inserts in them, making them.  I am going to try washing them in the washing machine and see how they hold up, since I've been wearing them barefoot. I will keep you updated!<br /><br />I love these and wish they would bring back all of the colors in my size (women's 10). There are only a couple of colors to choose from in my size now and this is the perfect shoe to go from business to casual in. I bought some washable terry cloth inserts from Pedag on amazon and have been using them inside instead of socks and it looks and feels great.  I think you could probably wear these all day if you don't need a lot of support, but I just wear them in 2-3 hour bursts usually. They seem well made and true to size. I do wish they would add a teensy bit more traction to the bottom of the shoe for wet slippery days. Other than that, these shoes are primo and I really want them to make more	2015-08-03

They heat up very fast. I was not able to jog around my track but a couple of times before they heated up to the point it felt like I was bare footed. I tried them again on a hiking trail, sadly this trail was full of rocks, and I felt everyone that I stepped on. These are not for outdoor activites, if you plan to use them indoors while working out then they will work out great. but not made for outside activities.	2015-08-03

Our teenage daughter was participating in a musical production through her school that had a tap routine in it.  She's never tapped before.  She wore these with somewhat thicker no-show black socks and she says she was very comfortable in them.  We ordered her size based on the measuring guide and figured in the socks, too.  She had no blisters or anything. The only problem she had, was that one of the taps came off of the heel.  One of her instructors helped in gluing it back on.  But we are very pleased, as they served their purpose and were very affordable.	2015-08-03

I really like 'em.	This review is an update to the one I did in midsummer of 2015, just after purchasing these boots. I've worn these boots on an everyday basis since the weather got cold enough in November, and my consensus is â¦ they're all-day comfortable. They fit well, feel good and look good.  I had to buy this pair in a size one whole size up from what I usually wear. Just before I bought these boots in July, I'd  returned a new pair of LaCrosse's Tallgrass &#34;western-toed&#34; boots similar to these because they were way too small and not wide enough, even though I bought the WIDE in my usual size. The LaCrosse sizes for this boots style seem to run smaller by a half or full size than I usually buy. The square toe version, in WIDE, gave me the width I needed.  They seemed a little long in the toe at first with the square style toe, and the heel of the sole sticks back a bit farther than any other boots I've worn. BUT: Both those factors have turned out to be solid pluses.  First, I'm a motorcycle rider. The longer toe gives me much better feel and control for the shifting and rear brake levers. Improved contact and traction at the toe, without too much bulk. The extra toe length protects my foot from impacts from the front, but not the top, since the version of this boot I purchased does not have a steel or composite toe. I've gotten used to the longer toe for just walking around; it's a non-issue.  Second, when it comes time to pull these boots off at the end of the day, that extra little bit of lip on the rear of the sole's heel gives a perfect catch to hold the boot's heel down while you pull your foot up and out. You can step on that lip with your other toe to hold it down, or use a regular boot-jack, or hook it under the edge of the top step on the stairs like I do. If the boots don't fit you too tightly, they'll come off easily this way. Nice for those of us with a little bit of belly, like me. Not having to crunch down over your beer gut to lace your work boots is one of the best reasons to buy a pull-on boot.  If you haven't worn a Welllington style pull-on leather boot before, they take a little getting used to at first. Your foot settles a little farther forward on the sole than in lace-up boots, and if the fit is right, this is not a problem, just different. If they fit right, you shouldn't have to pull really hard to get them off, but they should't be so loose that you foot slides around, or you can just slide you foot up and out without having to hold the heel down. You should have to pull up on the side loops to get them on, but NOT have to pull really hard.  The other thing I've come to like about these boots is the feel of the interior sole right under my foot: under the heel and the ball of your foot. There's some nice comfy give under these pressure points, but still excellent support.  I like everything about these boots, the western styling, but with a regular low, workbook heel, and all the features I've already mentioned. Nice work LaCrosse. I'd buy them again, if mine ever wear out.	2015-08-03

I expected the toe to be too narrow after reading other reviews from multiple sites but they actually fit perfectly. My toes aren't squished together and they're very comfortable. Usually my pinky toe rubs in Converse shoes so I figured they would be too narrow for me. I stood 45 minutes in them for my first wedding dress fitting and I was comfortable. The packaging was beyond my expectations. It came with a travel bag, extra rhinestones, and extra heel plugs. Even though they're listed as white satin, it is a little off-white and matches my dress perfectly.	2015-08-03

I've been stopped on the street in both Toronto and NYC by multiple people who want to know where they can get a pair of these shoes?

I have been running in Merrell Roadgloves and in Vibram 5 fingers since I started running and then I tried Altras. It turns out that extra cushioning really helps my time! Just the switchover from a barefoot shoe to Altras decreased my average pace from a 9:30 mile to an 8:45 mile over a 5-7 mile run! The sole is very responsive, almost bouncy. Since I was already running in zero drop shoes, my feet and calves didn't need much adjustment time. Highly recommended!	2015-08-03

If you have wide feet, don't even consider these. Too low on the ankle in my opinion, but all things considered, I'd say I enjoy em. But they do look kinda stupid with certain styles of pants. Good-looking with baggy pants, pretty stupid-looking with tighter pants. If they were 40-50 bucks, they would be worth it. I dont think I wouldve bought these had i known what I know now... At least they came in good shape. Only buying kicks from an actual shoe store from now on. Hope this helps.	2015-08-03

I bought the 3 pack & I thought it comes with blue, gold, and red. The blue is definitely blue but the red is a red/yellow and then there's a blue/green mix. So I was disappointed at first because I wanted the original 3 colors. I was most looking forward to the blue ones but actually the blue/green ones are my favorite. I attached photos of all 3 glasses. They're also a good size. I'm not a small person (tall AND plus size) and these fit my face just fine. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and if I lose or break a pair or 2 I will be back to buy these again.	2015-08-03

Okay so a little bit of a background; I was in desperate near of a supportive type of shoe for college since I will be walking around A LOT.<br />I dont have a very defined ach and my feet are pretty much flat, so I wanted a very cushiony shoe that did not have a very defined arch.<br /><br />Let me tell you, Tevas are the way to go! It is so comfortable and when I first put them on, I could tell there was no &#34;breaking in&#34; necessary. There was no chafing for me at all and the foot bed is extremely comfy. The 2nd time I wore them, I had em on all day as I spent the day shopping and it was very comfortable! My feet werent sore as they usually are when I wear shoes with no support.<br /><br />I was worried about getting a 10 at first. My feet are usually a size 9.5, but I don't have short toes so I decided to size up, which was a really good idea. They fit perfectly: not too wide at all, length is perfect (about a quarter inch of space in the front and back)<br />I highly suggest sizing down if you're normally a half size know you have short toes, and up if you have normal/long toes.	2015-08-03

They looked great with dresses and pants and were reasonably comfortable. Then, after having them for a month and a half, I was wearing them and felt a sharp poking/scratching in my ankle. A sharp metal wire (!!) had worked its way out of the bottom edge of the heel strap. Checking the other shoe, the same wire was beginning to come out of that one as well. The shoes still look brand new, with no obvious wear on the soles or insoles. This shouldn't have happened. And they shouldn't have been made this way.<br />I tried calling the contact number for Miz Mooz. The phone rang about 10 times and the connection ended with a fast busy signal.

I purchased these boots in both size 10 & 11 as my boys were wearing size 11 shoes but, rain boots do tend to run large.  I ended up keeping size 10, knowing that they wouldn't last more than a few months as they needed rain boots and I haven't found any brand that fits any differently.  The size 11s were not an option as they were too big - the boots would fly off their feet if they tried to run in them and even keeping the boots on while walking was challenging. We've only had these boots for 4 months and they are already too small!  I'm not sure why rain boots don't come in half sizes to allow some room for growth but, it would make things easier and cheaper as I now need to purchase another pair for fall!	2015-08-03

I couldn't wait for these clogs to arrive.  The colors are beautiful.  I normally wear an 8 1/2 shoe and so I ordered the Euro 39.  I have often purchased 39's and they fit well.  However, these were so large they came off as I attempted to walk in them. Even with thick socks, these would be way too big. Reluctantly sent them back to Amazon as I was afraid to exchange them for a smaller size.  Perhaps these were labeled wrong and are really size 40.  I didn't want to take a chance and then have to return them again.  Very disappointed. UPDATE:  I noticed that the price was greatly reduced and decided to take a chance and reorder another pair in size 39 (8.5) and sho'nuff  I was lucky.  These beautiful clogs were just delivered to my door and they fit well, with just enough room for a pair of socks on those chilly days.  So I was right:  the other pair that I sent back were marked incorrectly as 39 but are actually size 40.  I'm soooooo happy!  Thank you Amazon!!!	2015-08-03

When the replacement arrive, it was not comfortable either.  They look like they offer good support, but it does not.  The support for the toes is weird to say the least, and was the main reason why I had to return the second pair as well,  They did not feel like they were good for all day wear.  And finally, they do not look pretty from above or the front once you are wearing them.  They only look good from the side.	2015-08-03

I think this is definitely worth the higher price point, and is what separated these from the lower priced alternatives. It's like a perfect mold to my foot, and each step feels flawless. I would absolutely recommend these as an option that breaks into the high end spectrum of boots.	2015-08-03

I have a big head  - all those brains,don't you know? ;)<br />Anyways, having a big head means finding glasses that fit comfortably is a challenge.  These fit GREAT. They also look cool and are very stylish.  I got tons of compliments while wearing them.  They do a great job of cutting brightness and glare without reducing clarity or muddying up the view.  I find that many inexpensive sunglasses do just that, you put them on and you find you can't see the finer details of what you are looking at.  I wore these glasses all day on a pontoon boat on a very sunny day and found that they were comfortable and that I didn't get a headache from the sun bouncing off the water.  Win-win!<br />I received these complimentary glasses in order for me to review, but I WILL buy them again.	2015-08-03

After a few days and weeks of wearing in, the grip and sole seems to be superior on this model, it has not immediately worn smooth or delegates from the upper as my last pair of 608's did.  With any luck these will be the best pair in recent service.  A step in the right direction for our much beloved new balance.	2015-08-03

Mephisto's are more costly but worth it. I also learned I can send them in for re-soling when required and when they are returned they are basically as new. The cost is roughly 50% of the cost of new. Trouble is the shoes never seem to wear out.  Phil	2015-08-03

Last summer, I dislocated my kneecap and quickly learned that the type of shoes that you wear in a Zumba dance class is an important factor to avoiding injuries. There are a lot of slides and spins in Zumba and wearing your regular tennis shoes can cause a lot of avoidable knee pain. These slip-on dancers are the perfect solution to turn your regular shoes into dance shoes!<br /><br />Simply slip them over your shoes and position them where your foot would pivot when spinning on the floor. You might have to play around with position to get the perfect fit. I love that they help you move more easily when dancing, but still give you traction from your shoes during the times when you need it.	2015-08-03

Overall, they're pretty comfortable, but I only use them for running errands; I've never spent the day walking around in them, and don't know that they'd provide quite enough support to be comfortable if used for that purpose.<br /><br />The strap between the toe is pretty unnoticeable to me, and the cloth straps that go over the top of the foot and behind the heel make the shoe feel very stable. The footbed is very cushioned, though is slightly too narrow for my average-wide foot.  I'd imagine that if your foot doesn't tend toward being a little wide that these would be perfect for you.	2015-08-03

I have a width between a c and d and these might be a bit wide. I am still breaking them in so not sure how they will work out. I thought that they would have a padded collar on the top  but it is just leather that is doubled over. At first this was uncomfortable on my leg but they are softening up and it is not noticeable at all. They are made of very high quality leather and the soles appear to be bullet proof, so it should be a good long wearing heavy duty hiking shoe. My Columbia hiking boots allowed me to feel every rock and pebble on the trail but these have much heavier soles and insulate the foot from the rocks.	2015-08-03

I was nervous because the first time I wore them, I was going on a 10 mile hike, but they didn't need any break in time! For me at least. These keep the bottom of my feet from getting sore quickly like with my old shoes, but can still feel the ground well and gives good grip! Gave me great ankle stability and the perfect shoe for what I was looking for.  I love hiking but I'm not big into backpacking so I didn't need anything heavy duty.	2015-08-03

These are sunglasses.  They are very well made and sturdy.  I like that this particular pair is dark and that the lenses are polarized.  This is supposed to be a unisex pair, but I think it would work better for women than men.  These are comfortable and fit well.  They don't pinch or slip down the nose.  I think they are flattering and am very pleased with them!  I was given a discount in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-03

They are beautiful, and while they were a bit tight at first they fit comfortably after breaking them in by wearing them around the house.  Sadly, they didn't hold up on my wedding day.  The ankle strap on one of them ripped right off the heel cup while I was walking around the grounds of my venue taking pre-ceremony photos.  By the time I was able to walk back to the dressing room it had rubbed my foot so badly I developed a large blister before I even walked down the aisle.  I did have a pair of back up shoes (Blue by Betsey Johnson Bow, purchased for the reception), but was only able to wear them long enough for the ceremony due to the pain from the aforementioned blister.  I spent my reception in flip flops instead of the other pair of Betsy Johnson heels I purchased.	2015-08-03

I really like these shoes! However, other reviewers said to get them a size below what you normally wear. I did not find this to be a good piece of advice; although they fit snugly at a (European) size too small, they do stretch well so are still comfortable. There is NO arch support, and as I bought them a bit small, there is not a lot of room to add arch supports. They do look good and feel good for a few hours. Here is a weird aspect: the soles have super-grippy nubs on the bottom that make walking on carpet almost dangerous. They will make make great boat shoes!	2015-08-03

Great size of heel. Runs small. Lengthwise 8,5 fits well for my ordinary 8 size feet. Left boot (my left foot is a little bigger) was tied in a step, I am not sure I would be able to break it. The biggest problem was the arch area. My feet are medium width with no arch whatsoever, nevertheless, I was not able to tie sides closely. There was  a gap about 1,5 inches between sides on the left boot and about half of it on the right one. Size 9 could work, but it was way more expensive. Return.	2015-08-03

The color matches the photo exactly and I am very pleased with this purchase.  I've had them for a little while now and have worn them out on many occasions, and have had no major issues as of yet.  I would just be careful about wearing these boots out in the rain or in snow, because sometimes water does get through.  However, at this price point, slight flaws are to be expected and it is honestly not a huge deal for me.<br /><br />I have gotten many compliments while wearing these boots, and it is difficult to tell they were so cheap - they could easily pass for a pair of $40 boots. I am planning on buying another pair as a gift for my mother, who likes the look of combat boots. I might even purchase another pair for myself in a different color (mine were black).	2015-08-03

My only gripe is that they run very small. I have broken mine in quite a bit and it does feel better but it is still super tight around the toe area. Putting lotion on your feet helps them to go on easier if they feel a little snug. I definitely would suggest trying a half or even a full size bigger.

I love them because they are good quality. Also, bonus points for cuteness.  She does need help getting them on but that doesn't bother me.

They are definitely not leather. They aren't high quality shoes. The tongue says made in China and doesn't say what the material is but it feels and looks like cheap vinyl or man made. The laces are very light weight and the fabric that makes the tongue is also very light. I don't expect them to last long, but I am not normally hard on shoes. Ideally I wear a 6 extra wide but that size is rare. Orthoheels Vionic doesn't make them. So I ordered  6 1/2 Wide. It fit comfortably. There is plenty of room in the toe, and my heel didn't slip. I had minimal pressure on the side of my toes, but wore them for several hours without problems. The biggest advantage to these shoes is the aggressive Orthoheel arch support. It really relieves the ache of plantar faciitis. For the price, they are fine with no extra orthotic insert required. Edit 8/6/15 Correspondence with seller regarding the fact that they are described as leather was not satisfactory. The seller claimed the description was &#34;leather and manmade upper&#34; but I definitely don't read that and I can't see anywhere on the shoe that looks like leather. I decreased my rating by one star for this. I am not interested in returning the shoes. I will not buy from this seller again. I tried to find my feedback to reflect this and it's gone with no way to leave seller feedback or edit it. Seller name Peltz.	2015-08-03

I saw a lot of differing reviews of the Old Friend Men's Moc before I decided to purchase mine.  Several reviewers said that theirs fell apart or did not hold up well.  I found this not to be true.  Mine have held up very well with no signs of wear, splitting, or other flaws.  The fit is very good for a 5E size and they are very comfortable.  I am retired and on some days I wear them from the time I get up until I go to bed (although not in the shower!) and they have held up very well to extended use.  I also wear them in the yard when I water plants, clean the fountain, etc. and have not had any issues, even with drips of water falling on them.  I am a busy person in my garage with several hobbies and I wear them out there, too.  I wear them barefoot and am considering buying a slightly larger size for cold weather.  My feet were severely injured in a car accident and wear boots when I am going to be on my feet for any length of time but these mocs prove to be comfortable for around the house or to walk to the mail box.  All and all, I am very satisfied with the mocs and can recommend them without reservation.	2015-08-03

As a trail runner, they're too heavy and clunky for my tastes.  Once you get used to running in minimalist shoes, everything else feels like you're walking on stilts.  Having said that, the reason I got these was to use them as 3-season hiking shoes for places where it hurts to wear my thin-soled low-profile shoes.  I say 3-season because they're way too hot for summertime wear.  The construction is very solid and the fit is good, but not great.  I like a wide toe box and tight heel cup and these have neither.  These have sufficient room up front, but it's not toe-spreading heaven like a Merrell barefoot.  Also, the lacing provides lots of adjustability to size the shoe as you move from thin to thick socks.<br /><br />Overall these are a great value.  For someone who likes more cushioning and less ground feel they would be a great choice.  Now I'm just waiting for cold, sloppy weather to really use them.	2015-08-03

I normally purchase See Kai Run, StrideRite and Keen's for my daughter.<br /><br />These sandals are appropriately priced for its quality on Amazon in the $20 range. The leather is nice (not too soft and not too rigid) -- I used to sell products in the equestrian market and I am familiar with various qualities of leather. Stitching looks like it should hold and all of the lines are straight. The sandals are a Velcro closure - this is good for my toddler, but I'll be curious how long the Velcro will last. While the leather is nice, like I said, there are some areas where it is not straight and has a &#34;little wave&#34; in it. Only a very particular person may notice such a discrepancy and it should not affect the quality of the overall sandal. There are also some minor glue marks (glue squeezed out from the sole area), but it also seems minor.<br /><br />The sole of the shoe is grippy and super flexible. If you don't want super flexible, don't order these sandals. The footbed is smooth without bumps (like in less expensive shoes from big box stores) and seem comfy.<br /><br />My daughter is tall for her age and has a foot to match her height - she recently grew into size 11 by See Kai Run or 11.5 by Stride Rite. These sandals are a size 11 and fit just right. They are also slightly wide, but that works very well for my daughter. I don't know if the sandals would be too wide for a very narrow foot. I definitely do not recommend these for a super narrow heel or super slim ankle!<br /><br />I like the sandals because my daughter can run and climb in them, plus they look &#34;sporty nice&#34; with her shorts, skirts and dresses.<br /><br />Overall, pretty good. With the glue showing and leather not straight, I've taken a star away because the sandal is not of the highest quality. I still favor See Kai Run and Keen's (which are in the $30-50 range), but I might just order this pair again next season.again next season.	2015-08-03

Bought these for my wife as she wanted a new walking/running/trail shoe. Neither of us had heard of Merrell until now. I bought these blindly from customer reviews. As soon as she got them and texted me &#34;These are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn&#34;. They are a little narrower than she is used to and doesn't usually look for arch support, but she said she likes that this shoes has apparent arch support she isnt used to.<br /><br />She convinced my mom to get a pair for her job (nurse), and so far she loves them after a 12 hour shift on her feet.<br /><br />I think we have a Merrell family now.	2015-08-03

As such, it's an excellent product for *preventive* maintenance on shoes and boots, to prevent delamination for example. It's also a good repair product, to stick part of a sole or heel back on, or to seal a puncture in a shoe or boot. There are stronger glues which you can use strictly to glue things together, but as a general maintenance material, Shoe Goo is excellent. I use it to build up the tips of my dog's boots, which wear off quickly as the dog walks. For purposes like that, it's best to use *three* coats of the Shoe Goo, allowing each coat to dry thoroughly before applying the next.	2015-08-03

The material is very soft and folds over on itself, which makes it very hard to use unless you set your purse down on a hard surface and straighten up the two zippered pockets to get into them. If my purse is on my shoulder, I have to struggle to get my wallet back into the large middle section because the zipper pockets have collapsed into the center section I need something that works on the fly.  The zippers don't work very smoothly.  You have to straighten out the zipper to get it to work. The two handles stick up in the middle and get in the way. I had high hopes for this, but no.  If someone could somehow make this organizer more rigid, it would be a winner. There should also be a leash to hook your keys on.  So disappointing.<br /><br />Not willing to give up,  I purchased a very similar Travel Smart organizer that is made of clear plastic.  It looks just like the Tapp C. above.  The plastic  does make the organizer more sturdy.  However, anything else that is plastic, such as a water bottle, sticks to the organizer making it a struggle to put anything in or remove anything from the plastic pockets. With some minor changes, these could be excellent products.	2015-08-03

It's a gorgeous bag with lots of storage while maintaining clean lines and a modest profile. The leather feels fantastic, but it's got enough heft to make it feel durable too. The stitching and detailing is well done with no popped or loose threads, and no scuffs to the leather. The compartments are zippered, open, zippered. The two outer zipper sections have multiple pockets for accessories, and the center (open) section with snap tab fits our 14&#34; Alienware laptop with no issues. While this means it's easily accessed, it does mean that if you get caught out in the rain, your laptop is vulnerable to the elements. If it weren't for that this would be a five-star bag, no question. This bag is an investment in a quality tool that looks smart in the workplace, but transitions easily to weekend use too.	2015-08-03

I generally take a 9.5 EE in New Balance, but as I get older, most of the sporting footwear I get -- esp. in the Euro sizes -- seems to fit me best in 44 / US 10. Though I've just got them (and so can't speak to long-term durability), I wore them on a 2+ hour trail ride yesterday and they were comfortable and quick, right out of the box. Though you won't want to go hiking in them, off-the-bike comfort is very reasonable for a sport-specific shoe, without compromising too much at all in terms of on-the-pedal rigidity. I will say the instructions for installing cleats are dismal -- you want to remove the footbed insert and position the supplied backer plate such that the drilled out + threaded holes face convex-side down. In other words, so that you'll be inserting the bolts into the parts that jut outrard a bit from the plate. Glad I didn't go for the more expensive Shimano MTB shoes (which I was considering), as they don't come in a wide version.	2015-08-03

I use them as my golf shoes and the comfort and tread are first rate. I can't recommend them highly enough. The only thing I'd add is that these seem to run about half a size small. I have some Salomon Men's XA Pro 3Ds in men's size 10 and they're perfect but in the Fellraiser the same size is a little tight. All Salomons are snug at first and they seem to stretch out a bit with wear but if I order another pair, which I definitely will, I'll get the Fellraiser in 10.5 instead of my normal 10.	2015-08-03

I originally purchased a size 9, but had to exchange them because they were much too narrow, and there are no wider options then 'D.' So when I exchanged them, I had to go up to a size 9.5 with these shoes. Other than that, the weight lifting and cardio done in them has been great, and they work exceptionally well. One minor thing (and I don't know why), but if I tighten the right shoe too tight around my toes, then there is a bit of shoe (on the inside) that digs into where my big toe meets my foot. But this is alleviated by just loosening the laces around that location, doing so was a remedy to my problem without any performance issues by the shoe.<br /><br />The shoes are extremely light weight, and, again, perform excellently well. (once you buy the right fit).	2015-08-03

These are the most uncomfortable boot I have ever owned. The best thing that can be said about them is how good it feels to take them off at the end of my shift.

Painted side gives the shoes a distinctive kick. The heel is 3,75, not 6,5 as it is stated in the description and feels stable and comfortable .

These are made by Americans who care about quality. Make sure you buy at least 1/2 size smaller than you usually order. It's not that these run small, it's that the leather stretches over time to give you a boot custom fit to your foot. Thorogood can do this because they use a high quality leather - think high end baseball gloves for your feet. Once they break in, you'll never go back. The cheap leathers used by offshore manufacturers don't perform like this so continue buying those boots too big for your feet and hope for the best.<br /><br />These are my third pair. The others haven't worn out, I just have one pair for dirty heavy work, one for standing all day work, and another for wearing around town.	2015-08-03

Ordered the Lucky You pattern backpack and this matching lunch tote for my daughter. It's beautiful, we love the pattern. The thing that worries me about the tote is that it's very flimsy. If it was not listed as a lunch tote, I would have easily mistaken it for a make up tote or something. The inside plastic lining is very flimsy and thin, there is no frame built in to really hold it up. It came folded up and once I unfolded I could see how it could serve as a lunch bag but still skeptical due to its flimsiness. My daughter has not started school yet so I guess we will see how this tote holds up. Also the outside is cloth, it's not very practical to wipe down if it gets stained or dirty.	2015-08-03

I purchased an 8.5 but the shoes were too small in the toes (when I ran, my toes crunched against the shoe).  I tried a 9 and although I had room in the toes, the rest of the shoe was too wide.  I like the Altra but this particular model is not the right fit for my feet.	2015-08-03

DEFINITELY RUN SMALL COMPARED TO NIKE, ORDER 1 SIZE UP!!!	I'm a big fan of the new &#34;Trainer&#34; shoe craze thats blown up. Up until now I have rocked the Nike Free 3.0, but their designs have gotten a little out of control, so I thought I'd try the Adidas version. Glad I did. Cheaper than Nike, just as comfy (if not more so, time will tell), and not quite as &#34;over-designed&#34;.<br /><br />I wear a 16 in Nike, Asics, Adidas Originals, but apparently not in new Adidas. The 16 was very small. All 5 toes were deforming the end of the shoe. Aside from them being to small, they were super light, very cushy sole, and seemed to have great arch support. On top of very long feet, i also have very narrow and flat feet to boot. These run on the narrow side, and that is great for me.<br /><br />I returned the 16's and ordered the 17's. It was annoying that the 16's were Prime, and the 17's weren't prime and $7 more expensive, 24 hours later.<br /><br />Solid shoe so far.	2015-08-03

I actually loved it but it wasn't at all was I was looking for - so it got returned. It's a medium sized / big-ish for right now- cross body or long shoulder strap type bag. It hit me at the high hip as a cross body - which is what almost all bags too (I hate that, it should be longer). But the bag itself is really nice- I saw the green one, it was a good green, like a light sage?.... I think this is one of the nicer looking Big Buddha bags- which is why I'm giving it a review even though I ended up not keeping it.	2015-08-03

I usually wear a size 7.5-8, and bought these in an 8 for fear that a 7.5 would be too narrow for my wide feet. The 8 fits perfectly except for the fact that the boot is narrow and does bend my foot a bit uncomfortably, but I can tell the leather will expand just enough. Overall, the boot is super comfortable and gorgeous despite my wide foot giving me some trouble. The calf is perfect (my calves are neither thin nor large, but are probably more on the large side).

Something has changed in their quality control. The right boot had a thick piece of leather backing the eyelets that wasn't properly sewn down and it rolled back causing a pressure point felt like an eyelet was digging into my foot. The left boots leather behind the heel cup was either to soft or not taut enough, it wrinkled causing a blister. About an hour was as long as I could stand to wear these boots.  I gave them about 4 tries each about a month apart. The materials seemed high quality but something was amiss in the construction.<br /><br />I called Timberland and they told me to send the them in (at my expence ~$25). They sent back the boots and said they were to worn for the warranty. I had just wanted them made wearable.  These boots, which I had worn for about 4 hours over 6 months, had no wear on the sole and only a few scuff marks. These were boots, I didn't treat them as dress shoes. I was more interested in the wear and comfort. I had never had to deal with Timberland's consumer department in the past, so I don't know if my experience was typical. I was disappointed in their response.	2015-08-03

So does everyone else	This is my second pair and I would buy a 3rd & 4th if I could find my size and different colors. Love them. So does everyone else. I have the red ones and would get others if they were out there - this particular style has been discontinued. I would say that they do run large so if you're looking for them you can size down.	2015-08-03

The weird part of this boot that was uncomfortable in a unexpected area.  When I wear this boot, the top part of my foot hurts.  As if the space between the bottom of the boot and the where the boot starts to shape upwards for the ankle and calves is too narrow or maybe the material is too stiff?  As I'm breaking them in, there is less pain.	2015-08-03

They have a really great look to these shoes. They also seem to be good quality. I normally wear a 12 in most shoes. These cramped my toes because of how narrow the tip of the shoe goes. By the end of day 1 wearing them at the office, one of my feet was killing me in the toes. I decided to hold out in hopes that they would stretch out a little, and they did. The next time I wore them they gave more room and the pain was nowhere near the same. The third time a little more. I do like the shoe for the rice and got a lot of compliments on them. They have rubber soles so they're quiet when you walk. They don't give you the hard sole dress shoe sound.<br /><br />I also don't think the shoes breathe very well which is my biggest complaint. If you have wide feet like me, you may not want to consider these shoes at all (as I don't seem them available in wide at this point in time). With Amazon you can always return the shoe upfront if it doesn't fit. I took a gamble and I'm happy. They've loosened up and look great. I just hope they hold up for a while.	2015-08-03

They are still going strong.	2015-08-03

I've always liked the look and the comfort of the higher end AirMax series. After running my first 5K earlier this year with my wife, having never run distance on pavement (played soccer) and for the first time having painful feet for a couple days after; I decided to get some good running shoes. I went to the local running store and had my foot completely measured/evaluated by stepping on the device they use. Then I proceeded to try on most all their shoes and found these ASICS the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn! They tend to run a bit small, I purchased in a 10 wide and generally wear 8 1/2 wide. Since my local store didn't have the color choice I liked only the size, I found the exact ones on Amazon for the same price to arrive before the next weekend's run.	2015-08-03

I bought my first pair of ECCOs over 10 years ago. They were the most comfortable pair of dress shoes I've had. When a hole finally appeared in the heel of my shoe, I decided to get another pair of ECCOs. I was worried that maybe the company changed and the quality lowered over the years like what happens to many other companies. I've been wearing them for a few weeks now and love these just as much as I loved my previous pair! They fit perfect and stay comfortable all day! Would recommend to anyone wanting to look good without sacrificing comfort!	2015-08-03

When I got them I thought they were pretty tight.<br /><br />Before I sent them back I ordered the 12.5 just to be sure.  I still wasn't sure so I asked questions and decided to keep the 12.  I AM SO GLAD I KEPT THE 12 and not the 12.5.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to hiking with these.<br /><br />Worth every penny.	2015-08-03

It is a WALLET - so all of the questions answered above are completely pointless and mean nothing.<br /><br />On to the wallet. I ordered a different wallet (the Heshe one every woman has -- found here http://www.amazon.com/Heshe%C2%AE-Genuine-Leather-Organizer-Arround/dp/B00G8INOC4/.) That one took so long to arrive, I ordered this one in the meantime. I needed a wallet, not an IOU from China. Am I delighted! It is beautiful and functional, and everything fits where it should. BTW, I gave the other one to a friend months later when she needed a new wallet and she was putting things into it when the zipper broke - before it was ever even used, so I dunno what Amazon is selling, but I have serious doubts about the other one. As for this one, if I was really wealthy & had more time, I would buy one in every single color.	2015-08-03

Pediaped shoes are recommended for new walkers because the soft soles promote healthy foot development while older infants/young toddlers are learning to walk.  My daughter has been wearing the 6-12 month size all summer (actual age 12-14 months) and THEY ARE AWESOME.  The white leather shoes go with every outfit and look cute with dresses or play clothes.  These are versatile and excellent quality and have held up through a summer of grass, sidewalks, playgrounds, water fountains, sandboxes and much more.  Most importantly, they are comfortable.  I wish buying adult shoes was this easy and satisfying.	2015-08-03

This might have been okay, but<br />---Inner lining of shoe doesn't breathe well<br />Conclusion:<br />---Great shoes for Summer in upper Catskills, avoid if you live south of Pennsylvania, and if you live south of Virginia, there's a good chance nothing much will help you stay cool outside anyway...<br />-------<br />If you live anywhere with temperatures regularly above 85 Fahrenheit, don't buy these. The &#34;mesh&#34; uppers on these are mostly aesthetic, and rest atop a solid layer of cloth. I understand the description lists a cloth lining. However, if the lining is primarily an insulator and does not, in fact, &#34;breathe&#34; well (as advertised) the mesh is of little to no value.<br /><br />I thought I might be imagining it, because surely the mesh topper wouldn't be inhibited by a single layer of cloth as long as it breathes well, right?<br /><br />So I ran a little experiment comparing the Merrells to my (dark-grey) running shoes in terms of how well they stay cool. To ensure reasonable control, I stood outside in both pairs of shoes in direct sunlight for 3 minutes before getting into my (already-cool) car to test. Placing my feet in the Merrels and then under the AC unit in my car, it took 3 minutes before I could even *begin* to feel any of the coolness underneath. I did the same experiment with my running shoes and started feeling the coolness on my toes within 30s.	2015-08-03

If you have ever broken in a pair of Doc Martens or a pair of Fyre boots you will already be familiar with the &#34;stiff&#34; leather that so many mention in their reviews; this is a sign of a high quality and long-lasting pair of shoes. It is also helpful to make sure to read all the reviews for the style you are interested in buying and measure your feet per the size guide on the SH site to make sure you secure the proper size. It is very helpful. These boots are beautiful! The Bordeaux/Nature is a great combo! They do seem to run a little small, but I did expect that per other reviews. My feet are average size 7's, medium to sIightly narrow and bought these in a size 38 - perfect. Maybe a little loose once fully broken in. I have been breaking them in inside (because it's summer). Today was the 4th time I wore them for a few hours (with socks). My feet are starting to mold to the shoes now and they are pretty comfortable. Only 2 trouble spots for me - the width of my feet are a little tight and achy after an hour or so but going away now. And the ankle area on my left foot was a little sore yesterday, but not today.  Not hard to get on at all - use the pull tab in the back! Take it easy breaking them in and they'll last you forever!! Don't expect to wear them out of box for hours without discomfort!	2015-08-03

Unfortunately, since the shape didn't quite fit my shoe perfectly it caused little parts of the insole to crinkle up over time, creating sharp hard lumps in my footbed that did not feel good to walk on.  By the end of the month I had to discard them because they were too uncomfortable to walk on any more, and they could not be simply smoothed out or cut to size like a normal insole (at least I don't have the tools for that).<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a great idea, but in practice they should either be smaller than the size of your shoe so that the edges dont get pushed up causing sharp spots in the footbed, or you need to have to tools to precisely cut these to the shape of your shoe interior which I think would be difficult to do, but doable with enough dedication.  I wanted to like these and I could certainly use the shoe freshening of this idea, but they just didn't work for me.	2015-08-03

I love these shoes. They go with just about everything and very comfortable as long as you don't do a lot of walking or dancing. My feet slides forward in these sandals and the thong begins to hurts a little after a few hours. With that said, I still love these sandals because they are great for a lunch/dinner date and movie but dancing or running through the mall is out of the question for me. I purchased a second pair because they look great on and they do just fine for those days with minimal walking activities.	2015-08-03

Only thing bad about tote is the zipper doesn't completely close the tote, there is a small hole (intentional) so items would potentially fall out - however the inner-bag's zipper closes everything inside completely.  The strap is adjustable...<br /><br />Only bad thing is that the bag smelled pretty bad at first... Like fishy plastic; but air it out for a day and it's fine.	2015-08-03

While they are adorable and simple, they will absolutely kill your feet.  There is no give whatesoever on the toe part (see my review below where I thought they would loosen up).  I wore them for a wedding and my feet were absolutely killing me an hour into the wedding.  I have no idea how I walked up and down the aisle.  I had to take them off as soon as I got to the reception and put flip flops on.  These shoes now sit in the back of my closet and will soon be heading to Goodwill.  Do yourself a favor and order a better pair of shoes, even at a higher price.   They are a great purchase for the price and the simplicity of them cannot be beat.  I'll be wearing these with a grey bridesmaids dress for an upcoming wedding and while they aren't entirely comfortable, they are better than many other strappy sandals I've worn.  The bottom strap is a little tight around my toes, but I'm sure with time it will loosen up and become more comfortable.  I'm happy with the purchase overall and would recommend them.	2015-08-03

One side is very smooth, the other textured for better adhesion when cemented. I have been using this type of material for soles for hand-made footwear for decades. I have recently learned that gluing small patches of very thin Vibram sheet to the wear regions (ball and heel) vastly increases the life of the soles and substantially reduces chances of slipping on wet, smooth surfaces. The black sole color works well with black or brown shoes.	2015-08-03

My last 4 pairs of running sneakers were all Asics - 2 pairs of the GT 1000's and 2 pairs of the GT 2000's, all of which I wore straight into the ground. They were terrific for an overpronator who walks like a damn pigeon (i.e. me!). This time, I wanted to try something new and read lots of amazing reviews about the Kayano 21s, including a mention that they made the toe box bigger from the last model. I fell in love with the turquoise/pink/white color scheme so I snagged a pair... although they are amazingly comfortable from the get-go and look superb, the toe box is in no way, shape or form 'bigger'. I was a size 8 in the GT 1000s & 2000s - with the Kayano 21s, the left shoe fits perfect, but my right big toe keeps hitting the front of the sneaker. NOT comfortable! Though they are not causing any real pain, I could not stop focusing on my right toe hitting the front of the sneaker. A size 8.5 will be too big for my left foot, so I guess I am going back to the GT 2000s :( Same situation happened when I tried to buy a pair of the Gel Nimbus sneakers back in the spring, so be forewarned!!	2015-08-03

I could walk without pain. I left them on the rest of the day and never had any pain. It's such a relief. I plan to wear them all the time until I can heal my condition or they start hurting. I'll try to remember to do an update later. These shoes are absolutely worth trying! And they are actually pretty cute. I like them.  The shoelaces could be longer though...	2015-08-03

I am slightly overweight.  Don't get me wrong - these are nice to run in if I wasn't so heavy, and they are comfortable and treat my feet as well as my Danner work boots, on my feet all day.<br /><br />I don't expect these to be as durable as work boots, but they are light and breathable and excellent for walking and working.  I have a neutral gait, and medium/high arches.  My foot is medium wide, and these were comfortable out of the box.  The only thing that I would suggest to improve them, would be a different lining in the heel, because it turns into those sand paperish little fabric balls that you get with cheap underwear.<br /><br />Also, one version of the Rannell has a suede upper forefoot, all the way up to the laces.  I really like the mesh piece on my version.  First of all, my big toe is covered by the suede toe cap, so durability isn't a concern.  Second, the breath-ability of the mesh is a big reason why I wear them.  Thirdly, suede really is impractical, and the suede synthetic balance on my version of the Rannells, with the mesh forefoot upper, is a good balance.  If I had any more suede to worry about, it would turn me off of the shoe.  It's a borderline neutral running shoe, and a great neutral walking shoe for me.  More suede, in my opinion, would relegate it to the fashion bin, and for me, there are much more fashionable shoes than this one.  The mesh makes it way better for walking and working in, with the suede in there for stylish reinforcement.	2015-08-03

I bought them in red, and they look just as I expected.<br /><br />The shoes are best to wear if you aren't doing much walking, as they do not have much support or cushion in them. It basically feels like your feet directly hitting the sidewalk/pavement when wearing them. I would rate them more highly if they were more comfortable for walking, as I do really like the look of them.<br /><br />I ordered a half size larger than normal, which fits me fine (a bit on the smaller side but fits). I definitely recommend going up at least a half size.	2015-08-03

Further, they didn't last well. I usually work from a home office, leaving only about four weeks a year when my customers or co-workers would even know whether I got dressed. That means that my dress shoes do light duty, and even so I got less than three years out of these (Maybe four or five professional conferences, a couple client engagements, and a funeral) before the surface started to peel off in a truly unsightly manner. For the price, I expect better.	2015-08-03

I first saw it in a store, but they ran out of my size and I was so happy to find it here at Amazon! It is super cute and extremely comfy. You may wonder why I said that I can only wear it for a couple of hours, but that is because both of my feet are injured and I cant wear any shoe for longer than a couple of hours. Actually, less than that, but this is amazing! I was so excited to get these for that reason. They are extremely light, like a fluff on my feet. I have another pair of shoes by Bernie Mev, as well and I want a whole closet full. Oh, and I get so many compliments on them. I have seen that other companies are trying to knock them off, but honestly this is the best brand.	2015-08-03

I love boots and generally stick to Frye and Stuart Weitzman, but I really liked the design of these boots.  They are extremely comfortable and provide a little bit height.  I have slender calves and these are not too big for me--I can wear jeans and and boot socks with them easily.  They can also be dressed up or down (I've worn them with dresses, skirts, and jeans). Lastly, the color is not too splotchy like it seems in the pictures, but more of worn in look.	2015-08-03

They have some height to them so you don't feel so dowdy wearing the typical orthopedic shoes.  By no means are they close to the comfort of the orthopedic shoes but they are a great substitute and at the end of the day my feet feel a lot better than they did before I got these.  I still wear thin socks with them and from time to time I wash these in the washer and it has not damaged them.  I did notice they run a little on the larger side so I would order one size down if possible especially because they stretch.  There was no break-in period for these shoes with me, from day one they were so comfortable - I highly recommend them if you need work shoes and stand a lot at your job.	2015-08-03

I love that it can be worn as a backpack or purse which is the main reason I purchased this.  I use it for my stuff as well as for my baby's things.  I hated having to carry both a purse and diaper bag so now I just use this!  It has plenty of room for the essentials and tons of pockets which can make it tricky digging into.  However, there's a zipper in the crease where the purse folds that allows easy access into the purse not sure if others who wrote a review noticed this convenient feature.  Overall I love this purse and price makes it a great buy.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Eileen	2015-08-03

I purchased this bag around June 18 so it's probably safe to say I started using it on June 20-ish. One month later the should strap of the bag snapped as I was walking to my office. What's more, it's not the thread holding the leather together that has given up. It's the leather itself that has snapped, looking like what old rotten leather would do. I use this bag for mainly a 13-inch macbook, which is quite light. My last bag, which I purchased with less than $100, has lasted my 6 years and 3 different 15-inch macbook...and that bag is still fine! I merely replaced it out of wanting something new, and ice gone back to it since the new bag broke.<br /><br />Given this is a lxurary brand name, this is simply unacceptable. A $50 bag should be expected to last more than a month! So I contacted the seller and left a message with pictures of the damaged bag. A week passed and I never heard anything.<br /><br />I eventually called Amazon and Amazon processed the refund right away. I should mention that I was offered the option of replacement as well, but I was too wary of the product quality from this seller to take that option. So, hail to the excellent service from Amazon, but extremely unacceptable product quality and service quality by this seller. I don't pat $120 for this, nor even if it's a huge discount from the original product price - if it's a fake, please say it in product description!	2015-08-03

With anticipation I slipped these shoes on as soon as they arrived and took a few steps. The word &#34;wow&#34; came out of my mouth! I had hoped the other reviews were right about this sandal's comfort. They were!<br /> I am the only woman I know that dreads shoe shopping, as I wear a hard-to-find 10 1/2 wide. I can often get away with ordering a 10 in open-toed sandals, though, so I gave these a try. They are wide enough at the front of my foot, and actually narrower at the heel which fits my foot perfectly. They even make my &#34;Herman Munster&#34; feet look smaller! :)<br />I decided to order the tan/neutral colored ones too, chancing a 9 1/2 wide (because of the $18 price difference with the sizes) and it fit too! I have worn these sandals out for a few hours at a time, and felt no discomfort so far. They seem well made and should last me a few years. And I agree with the other reviews; if you are a tall woman, these sandals won't make you feel like you are towering over everyone else.	2015-08-03

These shoes have a soft tongue to them which I thought I would like but they fit funny.  The arch in the shoe isn't the right with and the sole of the shoe isn't thick enough or something - I can feel the ground!  Reeboks have always been my favorite because of the wide comfortable fit and I was so let down with these shoes ;(  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  They are large but narrow in the arch support area is best I can describe them.	2015-08-03

I could wear them year round, every day, all day!! I had never tried the Mini Bailey Bow before and read reviews that said buy your regular size not a size smaller like most Uggs. I did that, ordered my regular size and unfortunately, had to return them and buy the size down. They were way too large. Once I got the smaller size, they are adorable in a fashion sense and as comfortable as any Uggs are in a practical sense.  The color is delicious and I was not disappointed in any way with these. I would say this about the sizing as I know its always a controversy. If you have ever bought Uggs before and you normally buy a size smaller, stick with buying a size smaller in these. I have Ugg Classic Shorts, Mini, Classic Tall and Adirondacks and Bailey Button. the ONLY one I was ever able to buy my regular size in was the Adirondacks. Every other pair I own, I have always bought a size smaller and been fine with that. I wear them with and without socks and I am fine both ways with the smaller size.	2015-08-03

I prefer shoes that are feminine, not clunky, and I also want them to be comfortable. My favorite shoe style is a sandal â both flat and heeled. I received the AllhqFashion Women's Split Round Toe Cow Leather Solid Sandals with Flowers and Applique last month and was very pleased with the look of these sandals â they fit my requirements exactly.<br /><br />Not only that, but Iâve received a number of compliments every time Iâve worn these shoes.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier that comfort was a requirement of mine â this has become increasingly more important to me as I grow older. Iâm not willing to âsufferâ for fashion any longer and I donât think women have to. Iâve worn these shoes for nine hours or more at a time and theyâve felt just fine.<br /><br />The âbuckleâ is a little odd. It looks like a traditional buckle with a post that slips through the hole to fasten, and indeed you can adjust the sandal strap a bit this way, but that is not how the shoe is fastened on your foot. The fastener is actually a little slide bar that slides just behind the buckle and holds firmly. It isnât hard to fasten, but it is a little unusual at first.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this pair of sandals and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a feminine, flirty pair of flat sandals. I will upload photos of the sandals as well.<br /><br />I received a free sample of these shoes to test in order to write an honest review.	2015-08-03

I bought these for a running shoe, but they do not have enough support for running. They are comfy with the memory foam soles, but I wouldn't call them a high quality shoe, and don't see them lasting as long as others I have. The first time I wore them they felt fine, but the second time they gave me a horrible blister on my right ankle only. So much so, I looked down after my jog and saw my ankle was covered in blood! I had felt discomfort but though I just needed to break them in a little. I examined both shoes to see if the right shoe was different and what could be rubbing, but both looked fine. Waited for my ankle to heal and tried again, same thing. I ended up using them for work, where I wear very thick socks. That resolved the rubbing issue, when I wear very thick socks and don't jog in them they don't rub. I think in the future I just need to stay away from this brand, they just aren't very good quality.	2015-08-03

Took these puppies to the gym, work, and a day trip to Disneyland all in the course of a week. They feel lightweight but still offer the support I need.

They're light and the fit is very nice, especially for boots. Being a retired Marine, I'm no longer lean (260#) and my feet have seen the ill effects of wearing combat boots extensively.<br /><br />On the hikes, these boots did exceptionally well. The terrain was mixed sand/dirt, basalt and granite. Grip was very good on the climb and I was able to descend with little discomfort on my knees or heels.<br /><br />I would recommend these boots.	2015-08-03

I love the look of these.  I do wish they had a thicker sole with more arch support, but I willingly made the trade off in favor of cute.  I am usually an 11 but Reef tends to put the toe separator in the same place on the women's 10 and 11 so buying a ten left my toes in the same place and meant that my foot entirely filled out the shoe with no extra room in the back, which is okay by me.  My feet are wide, so I don't understand the comments about wide feet, but there are many ways for a foot to be wide I guess.  What I do know is that when fit is important to you you shouldn't get cloth anywhere that touches your feet.  You can always stretch leather but you can't stretch cloth, so I can understand why the folks with complaints couldn't get their shoes to fit right.  Anyway, I think they're cute...but go try them on before you buy!	2015-08-03

The patent top is a little stiff, and hurts the top of my foot a bit, so I'll just wear them shorter periods of time till I either break them in, or they break me in. I'm having to live in Birkenstocks because of a foot injury, so it is nice to have something to wear that looks prettier than the Arizonas I usually wear. There is, however, no substitute for the soft-soled Arizona with suede leather uppers for sheer comfort for a wounded foot. These little Madrids can go out to some nice occasion.	2015-08-03

So I got this in the extra large size and it's truly an extra large, probably true to its 12 - 13 description. It's a little too large for me, but that's okay. I've had a pair of these for years and really love them, and they do shrink a tiny bit if you wash them in hot water and dry on high in the dryer. They've always been very comfortable and provide much more arch support than most slippers, which is why I bought them. So if you're looking at the large size, keep in mind that at least for me, they seemed to run a bit small. But the extra large size is probably pretty accurately described. They're very comfortable and reasonably warm, not likely to make your feet sweat. My old pair are probably 4 years old and you would never know by looking at them. They have held up great. The new pair look just as sturdy and I am therefore expecting them to hold up as well.	2015-08-03

I wore the high priced sandals for decades and loved them.  Age and some physical issues made it impossible to continue with my life-long friends.  After a search of several years, I happened upon these sandals.  They are very comfortable and fully adjustable with Velcro straps to accommodate any minor tweaking of the basic size you might want or need to do.  Should the need arise, I certainly would not hesitate to replace these sandals with the same brand/model again and I would certainly recommend them to anyone searching for a comfortable sandal to pamper aging feet.  Comfortable enough to wear all day with no problem whatsoever.	2015-08-03

I was very glad I took an extra pair of shoes to change into. I really wish companies would get that our toes need to not be rubbed or pinched! I think these will be great work shoes once the toe area relaxes and quits pinching my toes--especially my pinky toe. I will update this review after some time has passed and the shoes are no longer new.  Here's my update. Do Not buy these shoes unless you want to ruin your toes! After almost a year, I threw these in the trash in disgust. They never relaxed and caused so much pain in my toes that I almost couldn't walk. Don't waste your time or money on these shoes.	2015-08-03

The brown/yellow MS Mountain Trainer's last has less volume and is slightly smaller even using a single insole.The boot consumed my full foot, front to back, with my toes touching the front.  I am returning the 8.5s for size 9. Size 8.5 is listed as a Euro size 41. The 9 is listed as a 42. The original model was fantastic hiker, heaver than the newer model. Update: I ordered the brown/yellow boot in a size 9 and the fit was too large even with both insoles in the boot. Amazon dropped the price on the pewter/emerald to $158 so I decided to try the 8.5 again and in this color the fit was perfect. I was able to get my index finger into the back of the boot with my foot pushed forward touching the front, with the trekking sock. The brown model must have been erroneously sized. I walked a couple of miles on my treadmill in these boots and there were no hot spots. I hiked 7 miles in NJ with about a 600 ft elevation gain to break them in and the boots were supportive. This weekend (9/5) I hiked the Pyngyp Circular ln Harriman/Bear Mt, 12 miles and 2000' elevation gain (moderate to strenuous).The trail was dry, very rocky with lots of tree roots and the boots held up well offering good support in a very light weight and comfortable boot. The rubber soles gripped the rocks well scrambling up Pyngyp Mt.	2015-08-03

They're comfortable enough that I can wear them giving tours of the grounds, but are dressy enough to work for events as well.<br /><br />I bought these to replace another pair of Sbicca sandals that I'd worn out. The other pair (slightly different style) was a bit too big, so I got a smaller size for these, and they're kind of snug, but I'm hoping the straps will stretch out just a bit like the last pair did.<br /><br />Super cute sandals, and if these last as long as my last pair of Sbiccas, I'll certaily be back for more!	2015-08-03

It's like a nice slipper you can wear out but not meant to work out in at all.  The best reference I saw was the similarity to crocks.

The 9's were great, went 250 miles or so without any problems. When they wore out, I got a pair of the 10's, expecting the same results. Not even close... They were less durable, slightly less comfortable, the upper material didn't breathe as well and my feet stunk horribly after using them, the tongue was too short and kept falling below the knot during longer runs, and most strangely, my three smallest toes on my left foot were falling asleep during faster training sessions. None of these problems were present with the 9's.. When my 10's wore out after a disappointing 3 months (or maybe I wasn't that disappointed), I began looking at other brands because of the letdown I experienced. I read on a review for a different shoe the greatness of the 11's, and thought it best I give Mizuno another shot. The support, rigidity, fit, and balance I felt with the 9's was a euphoria I wasn't going to give up looking for so easily. THANK GOD Mizuno went back to the proven styling and design of the 9. After a couple runs, my toes aren't going numb, my legs feel energetic after training, and I cut the mysterious time I had gained on my miles without changing anything but my shoes. My feet were so happy to have these, that even a 3 mile night run after getting home from camping for the weekend was a pleasure. I honestly can't wait to get home and pop these beautiful puppies on and go try to work on some PR's!	2015-08-03

I love the looks of it, although when worn they roll the foot inward slightly. Definitely run small. I wear a 10Â½ and ordered an 11 based on reviews, which the length is good, but the width is narrow, and I have an ingrown toenail, so until I get that fixed these shoes are borderline intolerable. I've worn them out twice though, and as far as function goes, they're great. Waterproof is spot on. I'd wear them casually, but the forced pronation feels odd just plain walking (not so noticeable golfing) and kinda makes you look knock kneed in shorts.. Had I tried these on somewhere first I probably would have just bought a different pair.	2015-08-03

I've only had it for about a week, but it seems very durable. The only thing is that the zippers don't always go smoothly, but it's a minor issue and doesn't detract from the overall quality of the bag. Definitely a must-buy!	2015-08-03

I'm so glad I went wit this size! They fit well, not too tight, not too loose and I like the black on black color, which goes with everything. They don't have much arch support, if any, but they are very comfy for a few hours walking. I wore these while traveling, and on the plane they were perfect. Definitely a worthwhile buy!	2015-08-03

I was just trying to find some very basic ones to go w/ everything. They are SOOO NARROW! Like my feet aren't that wide except at the top, but these are insanely narrow. My feet sort of hang over the top of the side, but the other flip flops that I ordered TWICE from Amazon kept coming to me in the same color, so I just kept these. I normally wear a 7.5 in a heel, 8 in an athletic shoe, and I ordered a size 9 because these are so narrow.  The 9 is a little long on my foot, but I couldn't comfortably wear the 8.  Also, I feel like the part that attaches at the top could be adjusted slightly to the outward part of the foot. I feel like it is too close to the inside part of the foot. But after all that, I don't have any flip flops, and I can't find anything in the stores that is comfortable either so I kept them. The upper thong attachment is more comfotable than those cheap rubber ones they sell in drugstores/lower end stores.	2015-08-03

I find most flip flops very uncomfortable.  In fact, most flip flops give me blisters either on the straps for between the toes.  These are very comfortable and because they are so light weight, I feel like I am barefoot at times. Barefoot but walking on pillows. Everyone that tries them on tell me they are the softest flips flops they have ever tried on.<br /><br />One caveat: the support is very soft so the are very comfortable but if you get them wet, i think that impacts the material. I noticed that my current pair that often get wet cuz of beach wear have flattened out.  The bottoms don't sponge back to shape. They have molded to the shape of my feet. They are still comfortable just not as soft as they once were. Hope that makes sense.	2015-08-03

Added bonus is the rubber which is exceptionally sticky on rock for climbing or descending.

Since these are slip-ons, I wanted to get them a little tight so that they would still fit once they broke in.  So I got a pair of 11.5 and my feet were swimming.  No worries; free exchange with Amazon, and a few days later the size 11 arrived.  They are a good, comfortable, casual work shoe.  I would just recommend buying at least a half size smallâ¦ maybe even a full size down.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After 1.5 years, and good performance, I ordered another pair.  I thought I had already dialed in the size with the last purchase.  The second pair was WAY too big.  Very disappointed by the apparent lack of uniform sizing.  The same shoe 18months later was completely different.	2015-08-03

We go shoeless in our house, and these are my favorites for all day comfort with arch support and plenty of cushion. These class clogs run a little wide, which is precisely why I love them so much. My toes have plenty of room to spread out to their full, wide magnificence. The Volt Green color is bright so don't run out to pick up some milk at the store for fear of being mistaken for an off duty clown.	2015-08-03

It should be noted sometimes 41 is listed as 10, sometimes 10.5-11. It matters not, it's 41. The second thing is if you are used to Dansko, Sanita does run narrower for the B(M) size. If you are used to the width with Dansko, you are probably looking for the wider size, which is the C/D. I personally found the B(M) to fit perfectly. I fit in both sizes, but the C/D is more like the Dansko fit. That being said, I prefer the B(M) size for my feet in Sanita.  These shoes are very well made, and extremely balanced compared to other clogs I have worn, and the arch support is actually better. In terms of colorways, I have found what is out there with Sanita can be very fun.  I am going to have a very hard time justifying buying another pair of Dansko's with the better made and better fitting (for me) Sanita out there.	2015-08-03

The fit on them is like everyone else said, make sure you get them a whole size smaller. I only went a half size and had to tie them extra tight. When I got these I was looking for something that could be worn all day that the water would drain out of easily and keep my feet cool and dry, and that's exactly what they did. HOWEVER, I want to point out that if you're going to be in any sand whatsoever, these shoes are not a good idea. I ended up going barefoot most of the time unless I really needed shoes, because every time I'd step out of the canoe and into the water, they'd get sand in them. Not a ridiculous amount, but enough that I had to take them off repeatedly to rinse them out. I got plenty of comments about them though. They look like normal tennis shoes.<br />So, if you're getting them to use in a boat or as a pair of run around shoes, they're perfect, just stay away from the sand. Other than that, they're very comfortable and supportive and incredibly light. Just wearing them to break-in (which was unnecessary, they didn't need it), I kept feeling like I wasn't even wearing shoes. They breathe so well, that the airflow will make you think you've spilled something on you foot. I'd recommend a good pair of laces that stretch, to make them easier to get on and off repeatedly for cleaning.	2015-08-03

The design is embossed in it which looks lovely n the quality is good for the pric. This is a very BEAUTIFUL and GORGEOUS peice<br />The set weights very less which is a positive aspect as i love bags which are light and doesnt strain my shoulder.This 2 peice bag set consist of<br />1.Shoulder Bag: 12.99in wide, 9.44in high and 5.11in deep, handle 8.26in drop.<br />2.Crossbody bag: 9.05in wide, 6.29in high and 2.36in deep.<br />3.wristlet: 6.69in wide, 4.33in high and 0.78in deep.<br /><br />The design and the color can be perfectly paired with  any outfit. Its well made and the stiching is good and its a prices very well.I will use the shoulder bag when i need to put in a lot of stuff and it has a number of pocksts - two slip pockets and two zippered pocket provide plenty of space for your smaller items or cell phone which is absolutely beautiful .<br />The cross bag is a go to bag as i carry it for grocery shopping or any small chores. Its very light in weight and the size is perfect for me.Crossbody/shoulder bag has an adjustable, removable leatherette shoulder strap.<br /><br />I have kept the wristlet for events like clubbing with the Girls;) or camping or theme parks ,where i dont want to carry anything bulky but still be able to carry the right stuff like Id card,a credit card and a flat shoe. I love the design and the fact that for a wristlet it has a double safety feature that is the after the zipper has a strap that has to be pushed in to click.<br />The  fabric lining isn't that cheap lining.It also has a cute butterfly chain and the set came in a white Bag as inthe video , good quality for the price and every girl/women must have this set to go with every dress.This being said please remember is a synthetic leather and not Leather.

I wear these when I am driving and the sun can get unbearably bright. These really keeps the glare out of my eyes so I can drive safely and everything looks crystal clear. The sky looks bluer, the green brighter and just everything is in a HD mode with these glasses. I was one of those iffy about these and thought they were like any sunglasses but there is a big difference. My husband tested them and now were are fighting over these so we are going to buy another pair for him. I would highly recommend this to everyone, not just one certain people but everyone, really made driving safer during those bright sunny days and you really see things clearly. The glasses also fits comfortably and they are lightweight so people like me who do not really like wearing glasses are not too bothered by them.  I received this during their promotion at a deep discounted price. This review is from my experience with this product.	2015-08-03

Below are some highlights.<br /><br />First off, this bag is very well made.  The whole thing just exudes quality, IMO.  Very nice material construction, and not one bit of it feels cheap to me.  I also love how the canvas feels - it's just so \\\"earthy.\\\\\"<br /><br />It can hold a decent amount of stuff, but just realize that not all of the pockets are fully contained.  There are three zippered pouches about the size of a cell phone that completely close and will hold in your stuff.  The front flap does not securely close, so stuff in that front pouch could spill out.  Also, the main compartment doesn't completely close - the zipper has opening on both ends.  While any large object in the main compartment will be contained easily, small items could fall out.<br /><br />As long as you're okay with it not completely securely everything, I have no problem recommending this.  The quality construction and great feel of the material are fantastic.  This is one of the products that I knew as I unpacked it that it was very well made.  Some things come across as cheap, but not this.  Every detail is well made, but just know that not every pocket is completely secure."	2015-08-03

I don't foresee them to last any longer than other shoes of this quality and type, but they sure are snazzy while they do :)  I get a lot of compliments on them.<br /><br />~The Wife~	2015-08-03

That aside it is an absolutely stunning bag. The leather is stiff and smooth to the touch, and so constructed that it stands upright. The stitching is neat and precise and in a contrasting beige. The edges are a pale pink / orange . There is an open pocket in front with a teeny &#34;Lodis&#34; logo that is almost inconspicuous. The interior is a chevron patterned, logo white and grey material, with one zippered pocket in the rear panel and two open pockets in the center panel. The shoulder straps fits comfortably over my shoulders and it came with a logo dust bag.<br /><br />My overall impression is that this is a well structured tote, and now that I see it it is too good for the purpose that I intended (i.e. airport diaper / tote bag). It is also nice and large, length and breath wise, but not width. Well done Lodis, you just made a customer for life.	2015-08-03

From experience I know that heeled boots can often be too narrow/small, so I naturally ordered these in 8.5, which was a wise choice as it turns out. They fit absolutely perfect and they are so gorgeous.<br />One thing I think the seller needs to change up is the picture of the TAUPE color. When you select the taupe picture, it shows a brown shoe instead. Only in the shopping cart, in the small picture, the accurate taupe color picture shows up. So it causes confusion. Just so you know what you are getting when selecting taupe: Make sure to check the picture in your shopping cart, not the one on this main page.<br />Last but not least: These boots are amazingly cute. I adore them. They are sassy and sexy. Kind of powerful. Lol!	2015-08-03

I usually wear a 7.5-8 but got these in an 8 because I read other reviews that they are &#34;narrow&#34; and I have a wide foot. The 8 fits almost perfectly except that it is a LITTLE bit long. It is not long enough for me to change to a 7.5, however. So I'm sticking with the 8 and will wear thicker socks. The boots are not very narrow so if you have wide feet, these boots will work for you. The leather is perfect, the boot is super comfortable. I can't wait to wear them when the temperature drops.	2015-08-03

They are comfortable but took some getting used to as I switched from another style of Ray Bans. I do believe these are authentic and they say Made In Italy. Best price from Amazon. Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was because these glasses smudge easily and seem to be dirty constantly. I don't touch the lenses however every time I put them in the case, they are smudged when I remove them. I think this has to do with the fact that the lenses are reflective. Overall though, nice glasses and I love the color of the lenses.	2015-08-03

I've worn several work boots and shoes from them. I spend the extra money to get a good quality product.this style is good looking and comfortable but the first set of these I received lasted less than 2 weeks before the rubber sole started coming apart from the side of the shoe. So I had them exchanged, no big deal. The second pair seemed to be lasting but after about 6 weeks the same problem happened. Even the cheapest not name brand work shoes I've bought last at least 6-8 months so this was very disappointing. I ended up returning them for a refund.	2015-08-03

This shoe in wide was way too wide.  The shoe in medium width was narrow enough that a seam rubs on my foot.

Since then, I have been buying Orthoheel for years and this is the first time I have been disappointed by them. Four months of moderate wear and sides have pulled away from the main base and the toe post has ripped, exposing the strings.<br />On a positive note, this style is amazing for people with width issues. It fits true to size because of the ability to adjust in the straps and the arch technology really makes a difference in everyday life. I used to have an issue with one of my feet swelling due to poor circulation. These honestly have helped and I haven't had issues since I started using them.<br />I'm hoping this issue with qualify is not the new normal. I will try them again and see if maybe I just received a lemon this time around.	2015-08-03

I bought these shoes in March and almost immediately after broke my ankle so I was unable to wear them until recently. Today I wore them for the first time and was SO HAPPY with how comfortable they were. However, about the second time I leaned back on my heel, the heel of the shoe just snapped off. Luckily I have another pair of shoes at work or I'd be hobbling around here all day with a broken heel. I loved these shoes and I still want to love them but I have no other option but to warn you that they're cheap Chinese crap.	2015-08-03

They had a couple fit issues though, mostly in that they were too wide for me.  The Vivobarefoot shoes are supposed to be wide so that your foot can spread out, but the original Ras were really really wide.  The newer ones are a tad narrower, so if you were really happy with the originals, you won't be so happy with the Ra IIs.<br /><br />Overall, the Ra IIs are just okay.  The build quality of these (might just be the SofA ones) is not very good.  The insole has wrinkles in it and the outsole has already seperated from the upper.  Its held on by the stiching, so its not gaping off, but that shouldn't happen in the short time that I've owned them (about 2 weeks).  The heel is also constructed funny, I think it might be a design issue though. It slants really severely to the front of the shoe as it comes up from the sole, so it really digs into my heel.  I've taken scissors and trimmed the seam, maybe that'll allow the heel to stretch a bit more.  Or maybe I just ruined my shoes and made it so I can't return them.	2015-08-03

I would be happier if they weren't made in China, but I haven't found shoes made in the US yet that I could put arch supports in. The upper is leather, so the heat from your foot actually loosens the leather. They have room for arch supports while still catching your heel in the correct spot. Figure on buying new laces, though. They come with those horribly waxy round laces that like to untie themselves and wear out quickly. The last pair I got was sized 7 W and I ordered 7 wide. When they came they were marked 7 WW and I was worried I'd gotten the wrong shoes, but they are apparently just marking them differently.	2015-08-03

They are extremely comfortable and can be worn all day.  The only drawback is I wore them without socks, and the memory foam makes my feet overheat and sweat after a few hours.  Now that the vacation's over, they are my go-to shoes for a quick walk around the block with the dog.  It's nice not to have to fuss with sock and laces for a quick walk, but if you plan to wear them all day without socks, your feet may get too hot.	2015-08-03

The width is perfect however, and other than that the sandals seem nice. The fabric used for the straps is a teeny bit more stiff than I imagined, but the microfiber soles of the sandals are nice and they seem thick enough to be comfortable in for a couple of hours.  Overall, these seem quite overpriced to me, and I'll probably just donate them with a bunch of other stuff I don't want.	2015-08-03

I liked them well enough that I bought a second pair. I have been wearing them for about 9 months now.  The soles look almost brand new.

This damage is less than I expect for a pair of shoes of this price range.<br /><br />One note, even when they were brand new, my feet got wet quickly when I was in wet conditions, walking through puddles, etc.	2015-08-03

But, I have a size 4.5 foot.  When I saw that these had a wide calf option, I was excited.  And when they arrived and I tried them on, the boot gods sang to me.  They fit without feeling like my calves were in compression socks.  They zipped up so easily and effortlessly.

Then I would know for sure that this is the best fit I can get. As a matter of fact this is actually my second pair. I originally bought a size 10 W which were just too long looking. I gave them to my son and he likes them. I thought a 91/2 W,  which I bought, would have been perfect, and maybe they're as good a fit as I can get. I don't know. They still look too long to me.  On the flip side, they look good with khakis and jeans alike, and I like slipping them on. They are well constructed, feel OK and look like they'll last forever. So maybe if I wore heavier socks, their appearance would conform with how they feel. As you can see I'm torn.	2015-08-03

It can be hard to find cute, summery, comfortable shoes with good padding/cushioning. These have that but it's too much padding. So much so that it keeps my foot from fitting into the shoe properly. It seems like my foot doesn't slip into the shoe at all. The sides are low enough that it rubs my foot. If there was less padding, it would fit better. The only thing that keeps the shoe ON my foot is the T strap & ankle Velcro strap. I can see that rubbing after a while too.<br />Have only had them on for a few minutes, they are going back.	2015-08-03

It was super comfortable from the first wearing and had absolutely no break in time. No blisters at all!!!  My feet are little wide and this sneaker fits perfectly. It does run about a half size big.  I got the sneaker in the gray color which is a soft gray blue. It is made a very high-quality canvas that looks like linen. It's very sporty and fashion forward for sneaker.  I love this so much I bought a second pair in the same color and a third pair in the striped pattern.  I did get the speaker dirty and put it in my front loading LG washing machine. It laundered very well.  Very happy with the purchase.   UPDATED AUGUST 29, 2015 Wearing these comfy sneakers every day this summer and still loving them. The Sand color just went on sale so I am going to buy in that color as well.	2015-08-03

Having been wearing steel-toed work boots for so many years, I find these shoes to be much easier to wear and a lot more comfortable. They are definitely heavier and stiffer than regular tennis shoes, but I got used to that pretty quick. For the first week or so, the back of one of the shoes rubbed a spot over my Achillesâ tendon to the point where I was wearing a band-aid pre-emptively. But either my skin toughened up, or the shoe softened up, because itâs all good now. Thereâs not much ankle support like my boots have, but that hasnât been an issue for me. The laces tend to loosen up occasionally, but it's so easy to re-tighten them, I don't really mind. If these things last a year â Iâll probably just keep buying them and never go back to traditional work boots.	2015-08-03

I have tried probably 15 different pairs dreaming of shoes that don't hurt. These work!<br />I ordered a 6 (I'm usually between a 5.5 and 6) and they fit perfectly. They have a really good sole, these solid rubber traction pads so you don't have to worry about slipping on tile or carpet. The heel is wide but not overly so. I would say you could wear these to an outdoor wedding.<br />They look good too! Cute vintage-y look. I kind of wish the buckle was silver (it's gold) but it's hardly noticeable. The ratio of the platform to the heel is good! Your foot is well balanced and not just tipped onto the ball of your foot. The toe box isn't too tight (my feet are pretty avg-narrow).	2015-08-03

For inexpensive, almost throw-away shoes, I was surprised by these. Bought the turquoise plaid last year and they have worn well and received tons of compliments. The rivets worked loose in a couple places, but I just pinched it back on and it was fine.<br /><br />Update- The turquoise plaid continue to get compliments, so I bought red and silver pairs as well. I couldn't resist. I wouldn't have expected more than a year out of them, figured they were pretty much disposable. True, I probably only wear them a couple times a month, but a few of those times have been somewhat hard walking wear and they have held up well. If these were $100 loafers, I wouldn't be pleased at all, the finish/materials are merely adequate. But for $15, they ROCK!	2015-08-03

They were great. I was able to navigate on slippery river rocks with no problems. They were muddy and dirty when I got home so I threw them in the washing machine and they looked brand new after the wash.<br /><br />This was my first pair of Keen shoes and they were so much more comfortable than I anticipated they would be. I am somewhat of a comfort shoe snob - I love Birkenstock, Finn, Dansko, Naot, Mephisto and Ecco, so I know good shoes. These rank right up there with my other favorite brands. The arch is not as pronounced as with Finn and Dansko, but for a day of water activities, I would not want such a high arch anyway. I have very sensitive feet and am prone to blisters, so I'm always cautious when wearing a new pair. Even though I brought a 2nd pair in case these started to rub my sensitive skin, I did not need them. I wore these Keen shoes all day with no problems. I highly recommend them.	2015-08-03

When I tried them on, the straps are a little tighter than I would like with absolutely no room left to adjust, and the soles are a tad shorter than I prefer.  So I returned them and re-ordered my usual size 9.  My feet are wide and this may have been the problem.  The 8.5 fit, but I'm not sure how long they would be comfortable and that's what I'm all about.  So decide for yourself whether to go down from your usual size.  I think I'll like them otherwise. They're pretty feminine-looking and light as a feather.	2015-08-03

The shoe is attractive in appearance, but, more importantly, is designed to allow people with imperfect feet to enjoy just being active.  The design permits the ball of the foot to absorb impact by not squeezing the toes.  I have a wide foot and I love to walk and after 18 kms, my feet, surprisingly feel better.  Socks are not required for long distance training, because of the unique material used by the manufacturer with the objective of comfort in motion foremost in mind.  A great shoe for anyone who lives an active lifestyle and a perfect choice for people like me -  And I can honestly say - I enjoy every step -  My fat feet feel just fine!	2015-08-03

Too narrow in the midfoot and toe box, too wide in the ankle. Effect is slipping of the foot in the ankle when you lean forward (despite rougher inside at the back of the shoe which will probably rip your socks). Also, because of tighter and more narrow mid section, this shoe will be prone to foot roll. What really amazes me is that after coming up with near perfect model of K-Swiss Men's Ultrascendor, they steadily has been keep going down. First, they replaced natural leather with plastic that cracks after few months, squeaks and does not breath. For what? To lower the price from 100 to 75? I have tons of options below 70 for cheap, plastic crap. Maybe because it is just hard for them to get real leather, who knows. My advise to you guys is go back to your original, natural leather K-Swiss Men's Ultrascendor Shoe. Please, do it quick before you lose most of your customers. I am already one foot out testing other brands...	2015-08-03

These sandals are a nice choice for casual summer dress.  the leather is thick and somewhat stiff.

I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 as it was not received on the day that it was originally said it would.  It arrived about 5 days later.  It is exactly as shown in the pink.  The lock was inside wrapped carefully in tissue paper for shipping.  It has a very good form but the zipper does not close down the side as shown in the photo.  It only zips across the front.  Quality of the zipper seems good.  It's exactly what I was looking for.	2015-08-03

I have worn the &#34;daylights&#34; out of them. This price was about half of what I had paid for the first pair. Arch support is excellent. Dansko & Naot have great support. These are my favorite shoes. Once you wear shoes with excellent arch support you cannot go flat again. This sandal is great since you can adjust all the straps except the end right over the toe, which makes it great going from cool to hot weather. I have neuropathy so they are easy to take off to give my feet a break. I wish Dansko would make a cushioned version of this foot base.	2015-08-03

Normally I feel like I'm jogging on small cotton clouds when I run in Skechers. These shoes felt a little too small and the &#34;gel&#34; inside felt off for some reason. They're comfortable in that they don't cause joint pains or anything, but I certainly would not buy these again.	2015-08-03

This was exactly what I was looking for (plain solid color thick flip flop with a comfortable cloth thong) but the price is a little high for what you get.  I was trying to find a match for a great sandal I found at Walmart several years ago.  You can see in the picture that this is made out of several layers of foam.  The top layer is squishy and comfortable but the bottom ones are much harder so they're not as comfortable as they could be.  This also caused the part where the cloth top meets the sides to rip the foam on the sides and release the cloth part, breaking the shoe.  I think I've had these maybe 3 months and one is already broken (gentle use too, just walking a little bit each day).  I love the look of them so I will probably try to repair them and keep wearing them because it's too late to return them now.  I was excited to find them but disappointed after they broke.  :*(	2015-08-03

The footbed here was raw-edged, and looks like it will fall apart before the rest of the shoe has a chance to give out. On cheaper versions, the edges were turned under and stitched to the upper, and I expected the same here. If I hadn't needed them that day, I would have returned them.	2015-08-03

A beautiful and classic boat shoes from Sperry. Although I have never worn an American made Sperry, this pair has a fantastic rubber bottom and an acceptable upper leather top. The leather top does not feel like superb leather quality, but it does its job. Some arch support when first bought, and take only a few hours to break in. It looks fantastic with almost any outfits and I wear this almost daily because of its look and how easy it is to wear. Remember to protect the shoes so it can last longer, a good polish every month or so would help this shoe last longer. My only complaint is that, over time it loses shape.	2015-08-03

Why would you stop making the most gorgeous, comfortable sandal of all time and replace it with this?	I already have the (different) Frye Phillip 2 Piece Sandal, and it is the most comfortable sandal I have ever put on my feet. I would buy a pair in every color if I could find them. Since Frye (inexplicably) stopped making those, I thought I'd try this one, the Phillip Seam Ankle. They are NOT the same thing. In my usual size 9 (the same size I take in non-Frye shoes, but larger than the 8 1/2 I take in Frye closed toe shoes/boots), the foot bed and toe fit the same way as the Phillip 2 Piece, but the ankle strap (which is a design difference between the them) does not work for me. I have thin, boney ankles, and the super short straps barely extended around them. To make matters worse, the back strap that comprises the heel of the sandal and attaches to the ankle strap cut into my foot/ankle in several places. Ouch.<br />Frye! Why would you stop making the most gorgeous, comfortable sandal of all time and replace it with this?<br />Please bring back the Phillip 2 Piece Sandal!!!!	2015-08-03

The shoes themselves are typical for posing shoes and have decent cushion. I followed other reviews and ordered up to a 9 because I'm an 8 1/2, but they were so big that when I tried them on my feet kept slipping down in them and the ankle at the tightest setting could fit three fingers. I decided to exchange them for a smaller size but as I was putting them in the box to send back I noticed that in the two minutes I had put them on, they had already lost a few stones. So I am returning them. I ordered the plain clear version instead in an 8 and those fit better, however the ankle piece still doesn't go tight enough.	2015-08-03

She complains that they hurt.  She's 3 yrs old, so I thought if I waited a few weeks she might forget, but every time I pull them out, she whines and asks to wear her black (PediPed) shoes instead.  Ok by me.  I'd much rather she wear the black shoes that don't match, than these that hurt her feet.	2015-08-03

Purchased these for my 6 year old to wear for the spring/fall season and they were perfect! She used to get leg cramps every night but when she wears these there are no more night time tears. She is very hard on her shoes and we usually need to purchase new ones every 3-4 months. These were worn every weekday and lasted around 4 months until they got holes in the bottom. They are really great minimalist shoes and I'm happy we didn't need to spend a fortune for comfortable shoes.  **To the other reviewer who wrote that they got holes after 1 year... I've never seen a kids pair of shoes last more than 1 year! It is also not recommended for children to wear used shoes that were already molded to another child's foot.	2015-08-03

I sit down at a desk most of the day so i dont have any problems but if you are moving most of the day i wouldnt reccomend these as they dont have any arch support at all. It kind of feels like your walking barefoot. After a few day they started stinking and ive been trying to keep that under control with newspaper and baby powder. it helps but you can definitely still small them. For the price i cannot complain. The sole is starting to come off but its been a couple months and i probably wear them to work 3-4 days a week. They've done their job for $10 that's for sure!	2015-08-03

Let me start by saying I wanted a tiny wallet to go with my tiny fossil purse because I'm trying to simplify -- when you carry a giant handbag, it's easy to start lugging a lot of junk around with you!<br />So, be prepared to make sacrifices with this wallet. I have 5 cards, then cash. And that's all!<br />There's the ID window, two slots on inner front part where it snaps closed, then an interior pocket and tiny zippered section, then a final pocket/card slot on the back. In the interior pocket, there are two things I wish I could remove -- 1) the manufacturer tag and 2) an attached key ring. However, the space is too snug to get down there and remove those items. So I flipped the attached key ring over the side and out -- I use it as the thing I grab when pulling my wallet out of my purse, and the tag just gets smushed down there and keeps my cash from cooperating and sitting down in the wallet.<br />And the ID window is tiny (it couldn't really be made any larger though) so be prepared to just take your ID out if you're young-looking and going out to the bar.	2015-08-03

It holds the foot steady and tilts outward just as advertised. The insole provides plenty of cushion. While the shoe fits as expected it looks a lot bigger than other regular shoes.

A few months after ordering, they are already showing a great deal of wear and tear. These are pretty good shoes for the price.	2015-08-03

BUT: I should have listened to the other reviews that mentioned the &#34;squeaky shoe syndrome&#34;. Within 3 hours of wearing, the right one had a horrible squeak with every step. Not the buckle, strap, or leather toe box. Nope. It's the actual sole of the shoe. Turns out that Sanita knows about this. Then fix it!

I ordered a slim -- presumably 3AAA -- as that has always been a good fit in VanEli shoes. These are so wide that even with double insoles, I can't keep them on my feet.<br />VanEli has recently taken a marked downturn in quality. I once could order online without concern for fit or comfort. Now, ordering the same size as ever, I am getting shoes that are obviously *not* the correct width, others that are far too short, others that are just poor quality. Something has happened to VanEli, and it's not good. I will no longer be buying their products.	2015-08-03

I have a high instep, so my first day with them, we were not friends. However, I was determined not to let the boots win. These are the best quality boots I have ever owned (or shoes for that matter) so I wasn't quite prepared for how the leather would behave. I read a million reviews about how boots with no zipper were a struggle to put on, especially for those of us with high insteps and arches. Try as I might (and I tried to the point of working up a sweat), I could not get my heels past the ankle portion of the boot. Knowing this was a common problem, I held out hope.<br /><br />Today, determined to wear these beautiful boots that I had waited years to own, I tried again. Plastic grocery bags over my stocking feet did the trick! It took about twenty minutes (ten per boot) to get them on by pushing each foot firmly against the wall, tugging at the pull tabs, and easing my toes forward, but once my heel worked its way past the ankle, it slid right in.<br /><br />These boots, once on, are exceptionally comfortable. They seem to fit true to size. I know it will take a few more wears for my feet to fully conform to the leather, but I'm confident they will fit like a glove once fall rolls around. These are definitely worth the investment, both in price and time!	2015-08-03

Consequently I went to the Teva brand. What I got was a superior flip flop, but a flip flop nonetheless. Little support. I do have wide feet, but even going up a half size, because they only come in even sizes, my foot is squeezed just a little. No one would notice but me, but it's there. If you are sold on flip flops, go for it--they are about the best you'll find, but don't look for a lot of support.	2015-08-03

I needed some sort of casual, oxford-esque sneaker as a daily running-around, matches-everything shoe. These are comfy right from the get go, fit snugly on my narrow heel but have adequate space for my toes (I usually need a much wider/more forgiving toe box in most shoes). Would easily fit someone with smaller feet, too. I usually wear an 8.5-9 for most shoes, which almost always means a 9 for Sanuk (any style). A little tight to first slip on but definitely feel like the soft fabric will break in easily, and I'm not experiencing any chafing. Good with or without socks, like most Sanuk's. The sole doesn't have arch support (it isn't supposed to - think ballet flats or flip flops!) and is very soft and comfortable. These will be a great alternative to casual flats and I can even ride my bike while wearing them. Besides which, they are super cute! The details are very subtle but give this shoe some personality.

I think I will eventually replace the insoles with something more supportive - they are easily removed, and I would like a little more support. But it isn't a a huge priority for me, since they are comfortable enough on their own.<br /><br />They fit true to size. I tend to be somewhere between an 8.5 and a 9, usually closer to a 9, and the 9 fit me wonderfully (running just the tiniest bit big).	2015-08-03

The arch support is not as pronounced as I expected it to be, but it is comfortable.  For my feet, the strap that goes across my 5th toes is not placed well - it is too far forward and barely secures my little toes (I'd tried a pair belonging to a friend, who wears 1 size smaller, and it seemed a good fit except in length).  The width is a shade narrower than expected for a medium width.  If I had not gotten this pair on sale, I would be sorely disappointed, as an extended walk might prove uncomfortable. That being said, the sandals are especially comfortable for walking or standing on concrete and tiled floors, such as while shopping or cooking.	2015-08-03

We had a good time with them and passed them around the party and not one person fit into these sandals! Only people that were a size 7 fit into my size 10, now thats just plain ridiculous! I sent them back, I don't want to see and hope that these $120 sandals are gonna stretch out enough to ever be comfortable!

This clutch is larger than you would think but also keeps your items snug so you don't need to zipper it closed. The straps are a nice idea but are very long on me and I have yet to use them.

Flex well with movement without the irritation that nylon straps give. The soles are about as simple and light as you can find. Footbed is easily cleaned and breaths extremely well. This are a good middle ground between the comfort of pure padded leather with its tendency to get nasty from perspiration, and the clean feel of rubber/nylon sandals with their limited comfort and wearability. Also were great on the Arkansas River rafting trip we did last week. If we could get the same comfort as padded leather on the uppers, they would be a five-star plus.<br /><br />They have become my go-to sandals, wearing them daily rather than my Ch***os or padded leathers.	2015-08-03

I have several pairs of these shoes (two in brown, and one in black), and I absolutely love them. They fit ridiculously comfortably.<br /><br />For me, personally, when I try on a pair of shoes - they have to fit comfortably immediately. I've been told far too many times when I've found a shoe initially uncomfortable that, &#34;You need to wear them in a little and they'll get more comfortable.&#34; No, I say. Just... no. I can't think of a single time where this is true. If a shoe is not comfortable out of the box, I'm not going to wear it because it never gets more comfy.<br /><br />So, with these ECCO Fusion Slip-Ons, I'm thrilled to find they always fit like a cozy glove every time I get a new pair.<br /><br />They hold up really well, look really smart, provide great arch support, and I can walk for hours in them. Highly recommended.<br /><br />5 stars out of 5.	2015-08-03

I do have a somewhat broader, flat forefoot and these shoes are amazing.  I use them instead of hiking boots - obviously you don't get the ankle support but I like a lighter shoe.  Previously I had a lot of Asics and Saucony shoes.  The laces don't pinch after several hours like many fabric laces do.  I haven't run a lot on treadmills but haven't had any problems the 2-3x I have. These are a very cushioned shoe, not for the minimalist crowd.  One of the favorite pairs of hiking/athletic shoes I've ever owned.	2015-08-03

These shoes are truly great with the exception of one thing, and that is the pointed toe. I've accumulated about 100 miles on these since getting them the other month and I really find the time I spend in them to be enjoyable and comfortable. Add to the fact that when I purchased them they were $45 and you've got a very happy customer.<br /><br />The cushioning on these is very nice, it's plush but not a pillow and you still get good ground feel. The shoes are extremely flexible and light which is important to me. However, as I stated in my opening sentence, the shoes have a pointed toe like a road shoe. I'm not sure why they did this, but I constantly catch my toes on roots and rocks when wearing these and today even managed to trip myself. These are still my go to summer time trail shoe, but the pointed toe certainly brings down some of the fun when trying to rip through the woods.	2015-08-03

I was looking for white sneakers for summer, not too sporty looking, not too plain, yet not too flashy. I like the subtle styling on this and the suede part is a nice touch as well. I find that fashion sneakers are sometimes a little too narrow - my feet are on the wider side (I sometimes get wide for dress shoes) and these fit just fine. I love that these have enough give that I can slip them on and off with the laces tied but they're not too loose when on.

I ordered these to go along with a genderbent cosplay I am planning, and they look durable enough to wear for everyday use! The shoes fit exactly as my normal Converse brand shoes do, which was great because then I didn't have to return them, and the material they are made out of feels exactly the same as brand-name Converse shoes. They arrived 2 days earlier than the ETA for free standard shipping, which was awesome. I had read reviews on these shoes that the laces would be too short to lace them up every single hole, so lacing them every other hole would be advised. However, when I tried this, the laces ended up being too long and the ends were uneven with each other. If you unlace them down to where it's straight across at the bottom of the lacing and align the ends, they should be long enough to lace all the way up to the top, though the bow might be small depending on how tight you lace them. The zipper on the side works perfectly, it wasn't coming off like I had seen in other reviews, and the only issue i had with them was trying to zip them while wearing jeans, as the leg of my jeans kept getting caught in them. All-in-all, these shoes are just as good as name-brand Converses, good for the price (considering converses run about $50-$60), and they're tall, which is good since in my state, they discontinued selling the tall Converses.	2015-08-03

I hike tough terrain in the NH woods almost every weekend, work 55+ hours a week, plus regular life stuff and these are by far my favorite boots I've owned. I hate that i'll have to buy winter boots too as these are strictly warm weather boots, so much ventilation they're really like high top tactical slippers. So comfortable too, AND they've NEVER come untied with a &#34;single knot&#34; like most foot wear will.	2015-08-03

They are very attractive and since I ordered a size up, they fit just right.  There isn't as much arch support in them as I need, but I think I can put an orthotic in them.  Also, they don't seem to rub like my more expensive brand clogs do.  If you want a very nice looking shoe for work or casual, these are great.	2015-08-03

I bought a full size up from my street shoe size. I ran my first marathon in a pair of Saucony, so I knew I needed to allow space for swelling. These bend a little too far forward in the ball of the foot and put pressure on the wrong spot. Any run over 3 miles felt like I had rocks in my shoe. The description of the shoe says they will &#34;bring your mileage to new speeds.&#34; They sure did... by decreasing my pace by two minutes a mile. I wish I had bought the Brooks Glycerins I was debating instead. I wouldn't be dealing with plantar fasciitis in the middle of marathon training. Don't buy these for true long distance running.	2015-08-03

I saw this little bag, also by AmeriBag, looked at the measurements and assumed they were a typo.  I ordered anyhow, because as much as I love AmeriBag's Healthy Back bag it doesn't go with every outfit.  Besides, I could return it. Right? When this bag arrived I was peeved to discover the listed measurements were pretty much correct.  A little girl's purse?<br /><br />But, oh, my ... I love it!  Look at the picture of the bag while I take you on a tour ...<br /><br />First unzip the flap.  We will get to the bottom zipper later.  With the flap open, right away you see it is not a child's toy.  The inside of the bag has AmeriBag's signature silver lining so you can see everything in it.<br /><br />The open flap has a side-entry translucent pocket where you may put your driver's license and possibly a credit card right behind it.  Below, at the bottom of the inside of the flap is a mesh pocket, the width of the flap, with a zipper.  A good place to put money -- bills and change.  Looking now at the whole bag on the inside I notice that there is an attached key fob, as well as many storage pockets of varying shapes and sizes.  There are two open pockets on the back of the inside of the bag.  Running across the front of those pockets are two wide strips of elastic, strong enough to hold just about anything in place.  On either side of the inside of the bag there are two cone-shaped pockets -- one of mesh, the other of the same silver lining.  Oh, wait -- turn the bag around and look inside of the front of the bag near the bottom.  Another zippered pocket!  There also is space in the middle of the bag for my cell phone (Blackberry Z10).<br /><br />A heavy grosgrain covers the otherwise raw edges of all the fabrics -- mesh, silver lining and microfiber. The outside zippered pocket, on the front of the bag near the bottom might be perfect for a small pair of reading glasses.  It also has a very long,but adjustable, detachable microfiber shoulder strap and a fixed handle, also of microfiber, on the top of the flap where it becomes the top of the bag when the flap is zipped closed<br /><br />The only place that the workmanship is a little sloppy is where the two pockets are stitched to the inside back of the bag.<br /><br />I wish ... the shoulder strap had something on it to keep the bag from slipping off my shoulder ... there was a hook-and-loop fastener to keep the open edge of the translucent pocket closed.  Otherwise, practically perfect!<br /><br />It is unlikely that this cute little bag will become an everyday bag for me -- but who knows?  It certainly carries just about everything I need.  This bag is the &#34;Tiny House&#34; of bags.  I hope you love it, too!	2015-08-03

I've tried other similar brands but none are as kind to my feet as fit flops. I have high arches and very wide feet.

I bought these shoes because a lot of people on here reviewed the shoes saying they were so comfortable. That you could wear them all day. My feet hurt so bad in these shoes.

I am constantly searching for comfortable shoes, but often find myself disappointed with what's available.  These Tevas are the exception!  They're super comfortable and can be worn all day in a variety of terrains.  I primarily use them while camping and kayaking, and they easily go from trail to lake and back again. The tread on these shoes is great, and although I'm normally incredibly clumsy and unsteady on my feet, I've never had traction issues while wearing these.<br /><br />Alll that being said, I do think this shoe runs a bit big.  I usually wear a 7, but could probably stand to size down in this shoe for a better fit.  My feet are also on the average-wide side, and I find these shoes to fit perfectly, which means they may be a bit wide to some people.	2015-08-03

It took me a while to get accustomed to the larger size of these glasses, but for a larger person (6'4), they fit and look perfectly fine (If you are a smaller framed person, these might look like one of those sunglasses/sunshields that go over normal prescription glasses lol). The grey lenses are a perfect shade that are not too dark but not too light. They will be plenty fine for those bright days on the lake and light enough for a mostly cloudy day. I have sensitive eyes so even a cloudy day can seem pretty bright to me. They definitely have that cool factor and it is hard to see the wearer's eyes through the lens'. They also fit my croakies so I can wear them around my neck. For 45 bucks, this is a great deal for a great looking/performing pair of shades.	2015-08-03

The issue with the shoe is that the insole is cut to large for the amount of room your foot has from the top of it to the top of the shoe material. That is where the fit is tight. I resolved this issue quite simply by removing the insole and now they fit like a gem!	2015-08-03

I chose the 55mm and it is a perfect fit (5'10&#34; male, medium build). No issues with squeaking hinges or loose fit. This is a beautiful product and the craftsmanship is superb. The polarized crytal clear lens optics are noticeably brilliant and a welcome reprieve from the plastic lenses common on other products. I can see these lasting for years and I look forward to using them as my go to glasses.  For the reasonable price of $116 (no tax/free shipping) I think this is a 5 star product.	2015-08-03

I have been wearing the same pair of polarized glasses for about 15 years, which retailed for over $100.  There is some wear on the lens and I really needed to find a good replacement for them.  I have searched for a few pair and could never find any that I like. These look similar to the ones that I have, so I thought that I would try them out.  After being given a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, I was hoping for something that I could use daily and for a good long time.  I just got these about an hour ago and I am extremely pleased with them already.<br /><br />First, these come in their own little drawstring bag, for their protection.  They are so amazing looking, I couldn't wait to try them on.  As soon as I did, I knew that I had found my replacement.  They are a perfect fit on my face, to the point that I cannot even tell that I have them on.  That is how lightweight that these glasses are. Even my husband complimented me on them.<br /><br />These are beautifully made.  They have a silver band with little accents on each stem of the glasses.  The frame is perfectly made and the lenses are truly the best part.  If you have never owned a pair of polarized lenses, they are a must have.  I have a sensitivity to light and these are truly the best thing to wear to cut down on any glare from other cars, the sun, anything that just flashes in your eyes while driving, walking, jogging.  Plus, they block 100% UV.  In this day, that is a great feature.<br /><br />Extremely pleased with these glasses and would recommend them to any one that goes outside for anything!	2015-08-03

I was fitted with a pair of Mizuno waves a few years ago at a shoe store.  I was somewhat surprised that I was a size 10 but who the heck cares.  I have wide feet and apparently raise my toes when I run/walk so I need lots of room in the toe box, or I have bruised toenails that fall off.  I have tried a few other brands in the past couple years, but always go back to these because they fit my feet perfectly.  I have a balanced gait, and these are recommended for this type of foot fall.  The heel cushions system is outstanding.  LOVE these shoes.  I think this is my 4th pair.	2015-08-03

I have been looking for a pair of booties I can wear around all day long without foot pain so I figured to give Clarks a try. These are very comfortable, however I definitely agree with the other reviewers that they run a little large. I always wear an 8.5, ordered an 8.5 here and they are just a tad too big. I will just need to wear thicker socks, but I probably should have just gotten an 8!<br />Overall, great quality shoe.

Their slip resistance and foot support on wet, slippery pool decks, sauna rooms, shower facilities and fitness center change room floors have kept me safe.  Moreover, I wear them in the pool for swimming.  In some respects it feels like I am barefooted because of both their softness and lightness.  This is my second pair.

They are light-weight and very breathable. I'm super picky when it comes to one thing and that's comfort.  I'm a moderate overpronator and an avid somewhat overweight tennis player.  Needless to say my feet take a beating.  They crave cushioning particularly in the forefoot and stability through the arch/mid-foot and heel. These shoes provide the cushioning and stability without feeling squishy(like memory foam) or stiff.  My feet are a bit wide but not E width wide and these fit perfectly.  A word of warning, if you've never tried a wave line shoe they will feel odd the first time.  I wore the first pair I tried on around a store for 30 minutes to make sure I could get used to the feeling.  After wearing them to work everyday for two weeks, I ordered another pair.  Nothing worse than your new favorite shoes becoming extinct before you wear the first pair out.	2015-08-03

I normally wear a size 10 US, but I have to buy Pumas in size 11.<br />As for this particular model, I'm very surprised at how well they fit in spite of being laceless. I bought them basically as lazy shoes that I can loaf around in. They fit so well and have such good support, however, that I've actually started jogging in them. I alternate shoes every other day, so I've jogged in these for 45 out of the last 90 days, and I have no complaints. They still fit and feel great. The look is unconventional, but I like it. My only complaint is that they don't come in more color options.	2015-08-03

However, these RYKA cross-training shoes are not only reasonably priced ($25!!!), but they even look cool! I have high arches, and the support is perfect.  Sometimes, shoes that boast arch support become uncomfortable because the support is too rigid.  Not so with these shoes.  I wear an 8 or 8.5 depending on the shoe, and I got the 8.5, which fit perfectly. I'm hooked, and I will be brand loyal from now on!	2015-08-03

The strap is easy to put on and the part between my toes didn't rub at all.  This shoe runs somewhat narrow.  I bought a half size bigger than I usually would have because the only other pair of Tsubo anything I purchased ran a half size too small but I found this sized to size.  I will probably purchase another pair in another color.  Very nice grip on the bottom too--a nice upgrade from a smooth leather sandal.  I'm generally carrying a baby  and had knee surgery last year and these give me much desired extra traction I need.	2015-08-03

I replace these every 1-1.5 yrs. These are my 3rd pair in this style. I swear by them. This style has the widest thong straps so are the most comfortable. I wear 7.5 and get 7. My heels do not hang off the back and they do stretch a bit with wear.  Not designed for wet or immersion...the yoga mat material will absorb and get soggy. I have hand washed these in the tub and air dried without issues.	2015-08-03

XX2i is committed to producing the best possible eyewear for outdoor enthusiasts and stand behind each product they produce with integrity and pride.  They want to insure that you are completely satisfied, no matter what.  XX2i sunglasses are not available in stores from what I could find, but they offer the best warranty that I have seen, anywhere.  You can try them for 365 days and if you donât like them, you can return them and get your money back.  Also, they have a âno questions askedâ lifetime warranty, even if you scratch or break the glasses.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the France 2 sunglasses when I reviewed them on my blog in June (click here for the review).  They were a great pair of shades for a great price.  I got an email from the rep at XX2i about testing out the USA1 and was excited to test them out as well.<br /><br />Again, the USA 1 sunglasses start at $59.99, but you could choose to purchase sets with additional lenses for $99.99.  They showed up with a hard case, soft microfiber bag, and a sunglass cord.  The hard case had spots for the sunglasses and separate spots for the lenses as well.  It is the same case setup that came with the France 2, which is one of the best cases that I have received to date.<br /><br />They wanted to send me the Crystal Clear sunglasses with green temple tips and the Flash Green lenses.  While some people (including my wife) might not care for the color scheme, I really liked it.  If that color scheme doesnât work for you, they have other colors to choose from.  The USA 1 has anti-fog cutouts, which the France 2 did not have.<br /><br />XX2i Optics calls their lenses 4k ultra high definition, a marketing term that refers to Advanced Chromatic Filtering, High Scratch Resistance, Impact Resilience, and Lifetime Warranty.  The lenses were great; clear and did not distort anything.  You can get polarized lenses as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very light weight material<br />Great Value (Starting at $59.99)<br />Great fit, doesnât move around or bounce while running<br />Unbeatable warranty<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not available in stores<br /><br />The France 2 sunglasses fit really well, but the USA 1 fit even better.  These are a premium sunglass without the premium price.  They only cost $59.99, fit great, and have the best warranty in the business.  It doesnât get any better than that.  Grab a pair today!<br />(as posted on http://runningwithoutinjuries.blogspot.com)	2015-08-03

The quality is below prescription frames & lenses, but is far superior to drug-store sunglasses...so they are definitively better than $5 sunglasses, but not as great as $150 sunglasses. The metal parts are light and sturdy and the hinges are really nice quality (just barely below prescription frame hinges). The only cheap and flimsy parts are the nose guards. Overall a good buy for the price.<br /><br />Not sure what I think about the polarized lenses though. It takes some getting used to, although it definitely does alleviate squinting and the headaches caused by light-sensitivity...I just feel like I'm trippin' balls when wearing these out in daylight and look at metallic objects (oh, and do not look at a non-LED LCD or try driving with these on. Just a friendly warning!).<br /><br />To the person complaining about how these 60's style glasses aren't of the same quality as the ones he bought in the 60's and are more expensive than the ones he bought in the 60's: seriously d00d that was 50 years ago and thanks to the progress of science and industry we developed these cool space-age materials in the decades since, such as plastics and lightweight amorphous metals that are far more durable than the brittle nylon and tin alloys used back then. As for price there is this thing called &#34;inflation&#34; (maybe you've heard of it?). Just like gas (petrol) today costs many times more than the $0.05/gallon that it did back in the 60's, these shades would be the equivalent of $2.50 pair of shades from the 60's which is priced just about right. Why don't you take your Nostalgia Goggles off and go back to telling kids to get off your lawn instead of leaving &#34;back in my day&#34; reviews!	2015-08-03

Due to the strap which is Velcro and can be adjusted according to how tight you want it.  I have an extremely hard time finding shoes that fit and these are a great quality shoe and look classy and lady-like.  Perfect height, I don't feel like I'm walking on my tip toes. The look is timeless, so I know I will be getting a lot of use out of them for both business and pleasure.  Worth every penny.	2015-08-03

I hope they keep making it, because it makes my foot pain go away, and the collar on the shoe is MUCH firmer than my other new balance, and eliminates my pronation even without my orthotic insoles (it's great with the orthotic insoles too). The shoes are expensive, and not everyone needs an expensive shoe.  On my travels this summer I saw young people trooping around in completely flat sandals- if you can do that, you don't need this shoe.  On the other hand, if you are getting bruising in your heels, or pronate, or just need a superbly built shoe- pay the money and get this one.  I wear a 9.5 extra wide- and the toe box on this is great.  Some of the NB cut in too much on the side- and hit my little toe.  But not this shoe.	2015-08-03

Perfect for what I needed - it's a stylish improvement on the usual square backpack design.  The buttons are a nice touch and soften the backpack look.  The zipper and hardware are nice quality metal, and the zippers slide smoothly.  There is a leather loop for the main zipper pull and it fits perfectly through the leather snap tab so that you can &#34;lock&#34; the zipper, and helps to prevent someone from unzipping the bag without you knowing it.  Of course, you should take normal precautions in crowds to keep your bag secure.  As far as the leather goes, it's a nice thick, soft pebbled leather.  The construction and seams appear solid and nicely sewn.  The straps are leather on the outside, with nylon strapping (like a seatbelt) on the backside, which is softer against your skin.  Several pockets inside to separate the smaller items, and one outside for easy access.  I got the purple, and the color is a dark maroonish purple, not a grape-y purple.  Love this bag for the quality and great price, and glad I got it!	2015-08-03

I can wear Reef flip flops and walk for miles without getting blisters or being in discomfort. So I was really excited when I found this cuter and more flashy style for going out. However, this pair, while still very comfortable and durable, was way too big for the purported size. The length of the shoes were much longer than a regular 7, and yet, the width of the shoes were narrow for a seven. Overall, very disappointing. I gave the pair to my sister who is a 7-1/2 and it fit her a lot better if a little bit narrow.	2015-08-03

I was looking for a durable, but lightweight shoe (I do a lot of walking). These are very lightweight, which is uncommon for a trail shoe. They're also very breathable which is nice after a long session of wearing them.  Unfortunately, after wearing them for about a month, they are coming apart on the outside toe area - on both shoes. I've tried working with New Balance to have them replaced because they clearly have a defect. Unfortunately, the best they could offer was for me to pay to ship them back and then give me a credit that only covered half of the cost of buying another shoe on their website. Extremely disappointed.	2015-08-03

They were bought to be shoes to wear to work (retail, office) and have lived through lots and lots of walking and standing, but they turned out to be so comfortable that I often wore them for just out-and-about and such.. Just today (8/3/2015) I noticed a tear in the leather just beside my left pinky toe (understandable since this is a high-stress area). So basically these shoes lasted about 4 years of daily wear and use, and were very very comfortable through it all. They would probably last even longer if I hadn't put them through so much! Highly recommended.	2015-08-03

Nothing like a pair of Aviators though (;	I really like these sunglasses. When I saw that I could buy these for roughly 75$ off Amazon during prime day I HAD to snag a pair. They're authentic, I researched every method of identifying a fake and the pair passed every test except I didn't receive an icons book HOWEVER turns our you're not supposed to receive one because these are NEW wayfarers NOT ORIGINAL wayfarers so they're not the ICONic pair in the booklet. One other test is that the fancy static sticker wasn't the same one that Rayban sunglasses usually have. It was a fancy static sticker same as the original but it was a different sticker. Overall for the price and considering it passed EVERY test except one (the sticker), I'm keeping it. It was totally worth it. Gotta say though I much prefer my pair of Rayban Aviators over these however when I wear a suit or want to take something more (in theory) durable, I bring these.	2015-08-03

It has a lot of pockets and that's great but what's the point if it doesn't stay up? These organizers are of no use because they are not sturdy. You will end up with a bigger mess in the purse with this organizer. I have to say I have searched for a sturdy organizer and so far have not found it. I guess a little common sense is too much to ask! Total disappointment. I ended up using a nylon drawer organizer that they sell at IKEA which by the way is sturdy and I put it inside the organizer so it would stay up but that is only for the inside, there's no workaround for the pockets.	2015-08-03

For those who have already had a chance to play the game, this version does not offer a ton of new content, though the additional story and quests certainly provide some fun. If you are new to the game or series and want something unique to play? This game is devilish fun and easy to recommend.<br /><br />The Deception series has always been a difficult one to define. I fell in love with the first game on the original PlayStation, when it was called Tecmo's Deception: An Invitation to Darkness. That is quite the title, but it was also quite the game as Deception left a huge impression on me. The game was dark, brooding and had a completely unique feeling to it. This is true of the narrative, but also the gameplay which had elements of action, RPGs and strategy laced throughout the gameplay.<br /><br />Fast forward to now with Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess and we have a game that embraces many of these same principles as you take the role of Laegrinna - a 'daughter' of the Devil made up of a fragment of his soul. This was part of the original Deception IV title, but now a new character named Velguirie has been introduced with a more mission-oriented sort of approach to the story. Both characters are similar in that they do not directly defend themselves, but instead use traps around their environment to do their dirty work.<br /><br />I have always felt like the early Deception game laid down some of the framework for titles like Dungeon Defenders and Orcs Must Die! These are titles that are tower defense with a more personal touch because of the character you control on the battlefield. In Deception it is not so much tower defense as using your own character as the bait that your enemies are making their way towards. They want to kill you for a variety of reasons. Some are mercenaries or knights who are hunting you down either for money or righteousness, while others have simply happened upon your location through ill fortune.<br /><br />The idea is basically the same at that point. Use traps to damage, kill or capture the intruders. There are traps that you can set, and you choose from a variety of them to be equipped with before each level. These can range from ground-based beartraps and explosions to wall mounted spikes and fireballs to raining death from above in the form of boulders and pumpkins. Yes, pumpkins - but it makes sense in a moment. There are also traps built into the environment, such as using a swinging axe trap to knock a column down onto a trapped intruder, or catapulting a hapless victim into the belly of a giant flaming bronze bull.<br /><br />Each trap comes in one of three flavors. You have Elaborate, Sadistic and Humiliating. Elaborate tend to be more about impacting a character's movements. These tend to involve beartraps, suction walls and walls that can push people into other spaces. They deal damage, but are usually more useful in getting someone lined up for bigger combinations and hits. Sadistic generally deals heavy damage, such as a swinging axe from the ceiling or triggering a statue holding a great sword to swing its arm down and strike an intruder. Humiliating are usually the least likely to be avoided, but also do not necessarily do a great deal of damage. They can be useful or lining someone up for a combination, but they tend to be a bit more difficult to predict as well. Drop a pumpkin on someone's head, and they will march off in a specific direction for a time, but it is the direction they are already facing. If they turn at the last moment, it could mess up your entire combination.<br /><br />Of course, enemies are not always going to simply walk right where you want them to. Some use jumping attacks to get close, while others use magic or arrows for ranged attacks. Some are certainly foolish, but these tend to deal the most damage if they get within range. Considering you often are competing with two or three enemies at a time, and it can be tough to focus on just one person while running from one location to the other. I will say that this game is much harder than the original deception - I used to just make use of narrow hallways and beat people to death with spikes in the walls. The game has come a long ways since then.<br /><br />The pace of Nightmare Princess might not suit everyone. There is a lot of waiting to lure people where you want them, and while I find the payoff to be exceedingly satisfying when it works, it can also be very frustrating when it fails. Add to that the somewhat squishy nature of the primary characters, and later levels will likely kill you a great deal. Replaying the same three or four guys to get back to the wave that did you in can be a fifteen to thirty minute experience that I am certainly willing to live with give the game's devilish charms, but if you are looking for fast-paced action, Deception might not be the series for you.<br /><br />Combining specific types of combinations, meeting the requests of your three helpers (essentially optional quests that yield more experience and money) and purchasing new traps and powers all serve as excellent progression hooks that kept me coming back for me. While this is a single player game, there are some options for creating scenarios and uploading and downloading them. The same is true of replay videos. These tools help to add to the title's replay value and they kept me coming back for more.<br /><br />Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess is the best version of the game by far. I had a chance to play Blood Ties on both the Vita and the PlayStation 3 initially, and it is a better experience here. The additional content is a nice touch, and while the visuals do not press the PlayStation 4 hardware, load times are actually quite snappy and help to take some of the sting out of dying and having to reload again. The end result is a deviously entertaining strategy game with RPG and action elements that allows you to embrace being the villain in a fun way.ompeting with two or three enemies at a time, and it can be tough to focus on just one person while running from one location to the other. I will say that this game is much harder than the original deception - I used to just make use of narrow hallways and beat people to death with spikes in the walls. The game has come a long ways since then.<br /><br />The pace of Nightmare Princess might not suit everyone. There is a lot of waiting to lure people where you want them, and while I find the payoff to be exceedingly satisfying when it works, it can also be very frustrating when it fails. Add to that the somewhat squishy nature of the primary characters, and later levels will likely kill you a great deal. Replaying the same three or four guys to get back to the wave that did you in can be a fifteen to thirty minute experience that I am certainly willing to live with give the game's devilish charms, but if you are looking for fast-paced action, Deception might not be the series for you.<br /><br />Combining specific types of combinations, meeting the requests of your three helpers (essentially optional quests that yield more experience and money) and purchasing new traps and powers all serve as excellent progression hooks that kept me coming back for me. While this is a single player game, there are some options for creating scenarios and uploading and downloading them. The same is true of replay videos. These tools help to add to the title's replay value and they kept me coming back for more.<br /><br />Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess is the best version of the game by far. I had a chance to play Blood Ties on both the Vita and the PlayStation 3 initially, and it is a better experience here. The additional content is a nice touch, and while the visuals do not press the PlayStation 4 hardware, load times are actually quite snappy and help to take some of the sting out of dying and having to reload again. The end result is a deviously entertaining strategy game with RPG and action elements that allows you to embrace being the villain in a fun way.	2015-08-03

Sony really dropped the ball when they made these. Of course the design in classic, but the build quality is atrocious. In a lifetime of gaming I have never come across so a fragile controller.<br />The rubber on the thumbsticks runs out quickly, which isn't a huge problem and has allegedly been fixed on newer versions. The springs on the triggers fail completely. The wire which connects the touch pad is held in by nothing more than faith - this is really unbelievable and has to be seen to really be believed. Let's not forget the unchangeable  battery life is laughable. All these problems and more can be yours for the low price of $60.<br />I recently had to open my Xbox One controller and was shocked by how much better the thing is built, it's a tank by comparison.<br /><br />Sony will repair the controller for free within a year of purchase, just pay to ship it back. However unless you can be without a controller for up to a few weeks you'll still need to buy a new one.<br /><br />Sadly the 3rd party options are all worse and it,s this or nothing. At least while it lasts it feels good in your hand.	2015-08-03

Thereâs much to like here. Visually, the game is impressive, the combat is fun and quite challenging on the higher difficulties, and the story, although a little cheesy, and not a match for such franchises as BioShock or Half-Life, is pretty good. And the voice acting is solid throughout. There are also some impressive cut-scenes and very enjoyable set-pieces. Despite all this, however, the overall lasting impression of the game is that it somehow falls a little flat. Perhaps itâs the fact that there are so many cutscenes where control is suddenly wrenched away from the player (I like a good cutscene as much as the next gamer and they are necessary to flesh-out a full story, but here there are so many of them it sometimes disturbs the rhythm of the game). Or maybe itâs the rail-like, linear nature of the game and the lack of variety in the environments. Or it might be the fact that, although the game tries to offer a mix of stealth and run-and-gun it really only gets the latter right. Or maybe itâs just me. Itâs true to say the same can be said about many good games and it would be unfair to criticise WTNO too much for having these traits. But at the end of the day, although I enjoyed WTNO, and will stick with the franchise, Iâm left with mixed feelings about the overall experience. Oh, and itâs yet another game with no quick save, which is annoying.<br />3.5/5	2015-08-03

Honestly, Tearaway is one of my favorite games that I ever played. I kind just spoiled the review a little, though I couldn't help it. Tearaway is just full of creativity, humor, and the most important factor of them all, fun.<br /><br />The story stars the messengers, Iota or Atoi (Depending if you choose male or female.), and the You. The You is well you. As the You, your goal to help the messengers deliver a message to you. The game places you into the game using the front facing camera to put your face into the sun or whenever you use the back-touch pad your finger comes out from the ground. Being in the narrative doesn't cause any weird disconnect as Tearawayâs world and yours interact. It works really well and makes the ending a really touching experience with a great message.<br /><br />Tearaway controls like a everyday 3D platformer, though due to the PS Vita having some unique functions that other consoles don't have it takes a very unique twist with how you play. Every single feature that there is on the PS Vita, Tearaway uses it and they all work wonderfully. Using the touch screen to interact with platforms and poking nasty enemies called Scraps, using the back-touch pad in certain areas allows your finger to tear through the floor to interact with objects or platforms, and for some quests you take real world pictures with rear facing camera for various applications. For example, there is an elk that had lost her color in her fur. She requested me to find her a more vibrant fur. I took a picture of grass in my backyard and the grassy texture covered the elk.<br /><br />Tearaway has some of the best graphics I have seen in a video game. Tearawayâs levels are entirely made from sheets of paper. The levels are beautifully designed and each piece of paper seems to be an animated object of it's own. It makes the locations look vibrant, dynamic, and just fun to play through.<br />Within the environments there are secrets and unlockables hidden behind tabs of paper that you'd pull with your finger or using the positioning of the camera to cleverly hide these secrets. The secrets consist pieces of confetti, presents, and certain objects in the environments that you have opportunity to take photos of  with the in-game camera your messenger receives.<br /><br />The unlockables are very unique in Tearaway. With the confetti you can buy paper parts to completely customize the messengers. You can purchase eyes, mouths, and other accessories. Players are also able to draw their own accessories using sheets of paper of various colors with the touchscreen. There is really no limit what you can do and all of these customizations carry over into the cutscenes which is awesome.<br /><br />I mentioned about the opportunities to take photos of certain objects in the environments with the in-game camera. When you take pictures of these certain objects you unlock directions on how to make paper-crafts out of these objects out in the real world. Which is a very neat and fun way to do unlockables within a video game.<br /><br />Everything just works so well together in Tearaway. The soundtrack is really good, unique, super catchy and it fits with the game's paper crafted world well. All of the PS Vita's features work well to make Tearaway an interesting and fun experience for all ages. Tearaway is one of my favorite games for the PS Vita and even one of my favorite games of all time. Tearaway is a well crafted classic that is a must buy for every PS Vita and a game that can not be played on any other console.lay through.<br />Within the environments there are secrets and unlockables hidden behind tabs of paper that you'd pull with your finger or using the positioning of the camera to cleverly hide these secrets. The secrets consist pieces of confetti, presents, and certain objects in the environments that you have opportunity to take photos of  with the in-game camera your messenger receives.<br /><br />The unlockables are very unique in Tearaway. With the confetti you can buy paper parts to completely customize the messengers. You can purchase eyes, mouths, and other accessories. Players are also able to draw their own accessories using sheets of paper of various colors with the touchscreen. There is really no limit what you can do and all of these customizations carry over into the cutscenes which is awesome.<br /><br />I mentioned about the opportunities to take photos of certain objects in the environments with the in-game camera. When you take pictures of these certain objects you unlock directions on how to make paper-crafts out of these objects out in the real world. Which is a very neat and fun way to do unlockables within a video game.<br /><br />Everything just works so well together in Tearaway. The soundtrack is really good, unique, super catchy and it fits with the game's paper crafted world well. All of the PS Vita's features work well to make Tearaway an interesting and fun experience for all ages. Tearaway is one of my favorite games for the PS Vita and even one of my favorite games of all time. Tearaway is a well crafted classic that is a must buy for every PS Vita and a game that can not be played on any other console.	2015-08-03

For all of the hype this game is really boring. I thought it would be fun but its really drawn out and the controls are horrible.

If you want a &#34;I & II&#34; player Famicom set, they offer that too, don't make the mistake and get two player &#34;I&#34; Famicom controllers.<br />My girl and I play SNES Street Fighter and other games with it on the living room TV. Comes in a fancy box with a cool key chain! The programming manual is clear enough although obviously translated. But there are firmware updates with PDF instructions on the website, so just go straight to that instead.<br />I actually have a Famicom and NES, and yes, this is pretty much an exact copy, so much that I'm surprised Nintendo isn't trying to sue or anything, and I'm glad they are not. The buttons feel good, not loose or sticky. No joke, this is a great control. I know most Chinese clone products are junk, but it seems these guys actually cared about making the FC30 and the NES30.<br />The only complaint (and it's minor) is that the Famicom version uses mini USB to charge and the NES version uses micro USB. Just annoying not being able to use the same cable for both. But whatever, it's minor.	2015-08-03

Those two things alone should spark the imagination of almost any kid - I certainly recall them coming together frequently in my childhood, and they seem like a perfect pairing for a video game as well. That the recent Jurassic World movie was such a huge success should only reinforce the likelihood that the game is well-received. The good news is, the video game holds up quite well as a creative, kid-friendly take on the movie.<br /><br />If there was a complaint from critics about the Jurassic World movie, it was some nitpicking over some of the finer points in the storyline. This did not seem to bother audience goers much as they flocked to see it in theaters and seemed to enjoy it. LEGO Jurassic World should appeal on a similar front. You do not get lost in any sort of story minutia here, but you do get to relive many of the bigger scenes from the movie, all against a background of bricks and amusing characters.<br /><br />Like the LEGO Hobbit game, this one actually pulls from story lines found in Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Park III as well as Jurassic World. This gives gamers a plethora of content to work through, with lots of brick-based environments to sort through, plenty of characters to play and of course, lots of adorably cute dinosaurs that make up the high points in the game.<br /><br />One of the best design choices in this game is the ability to let players take control of the dinosaurs and wreck havoc with them. The dinosaurs plod about in somewhat difficult-to-control fashion at times, but they are still a great deal of fun. This was a great decision because the human characters really lack for variation. This is not like a Hobbit game where you might have dwarves, archers and magic users that have different skills, or the Marvel game where the superheroes have lots of unique abilities. Certainly some humans in this can do specific things better than others, but it was a smart design choice to allow for non-human characters to control.<br /><br />As always, there is a sort of LEGO brand of humor at play here that works so well with the bricks and the story content. I remember being impressed years ago when I first played the Star Wars titles in LEGO form - I came away thoroughly impressed with how expressive the silent characters could be, and how funny the end results were. Fast forward to where the LEGO games are at now, and the characters are far more expressive than ever and this allows that trademark humor to really shine.<br /><br />Of course there are a ton of unlockables as you play, which gives the game a good deal of replay value. This is not the longest of games - each of the four chapters takes a little less than two hours to complete, so you are only spending about seven or eight hours on the entirety of the campaign. The unclockable content gives you a great excuse to go back and try some of your favorite levels again. The desire to do so is helped by great level design, charming visuals and a sound track that really soars when it needs to. To me LEGO has always been synonymous with imagination, and this is a game where it is easy for the imagination to get swept away in the fun.<br /><br />There are a few bugs here and there, and I do wish the dinosaurs controlled a bit better at times, but all in all LEGO Jurassic World is arguably the best installment in the LEGO series in the last couple of years. It will appeal to a large audience, it gives you a lot to do and... oh yeah, there are dinosaurs. My inner child absolutely approves of that.to control.<br /><br />As always, there is a sort of LEGO brand of humor at play here that works so well with the bricks and the story content.

The PlayStation 2 is well-known for having some of the best collections on it and this one is definitely one of the best. The Mega Man Anniversary Collection comes with Mega Man, Mega Man 2, Mega Man 3, Mega Man 4, Mega Man 5, Mega Man 6, Mega Man 7, Mega Man 8, Mega Man: The Power Battles, and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters.<br /><br />All of which are presented with their original graphics as well as new options which you can turn on or off such as added difficulty settings, an option to use the original 8-bit soundtrack or a remixed CD quality soundtrack (which was previously used in the Japan-exclusive &#34;Rockman: Complete Works&#34; and sound really nice, a weapon switch button which was later used in Mega Man 9 & 10, and a save feature! No longer do you need to write down passwords as the game will save your current game progress to your memory card after you complete a stage.<br /><br />This version also removes all lag from the games, especially noticeable in Mega Man 3 which is infamous for lagging on the NES. The games overall feel much smoother now and refined, even though nothing about them as changed. I do have to warn you though on the GameCube version the jump and shoot buttons are reversed - meaning that A shoots and B jumps. It's not a deal breaker however if you can get this on the PS2 or Xbox I'd suggest it.<br /><br />The reason I would suggest getting this version over the upcoming Mega Man Legacy Collection on PS4, Xbox One, Steam, and Nintendo 3DS is because that version is more expensive and comes with less features than this one even though this one is a decade older.<br /><br />OVERALL: I think this is one of the best collections on the market. It has so much content and anyone who is looking to get into Mega Man or relive their childhood should pick up this version because it is truly the definitive version.	2015-08-03

Definitely improving on the story from the original Mass Effect game. Came with most of the DLC and pretty much enjoyed the whole game. Can't say I was a fan of scanning planets for ores and the like, but the main storyline was good and I would recommend to anyone new to the Mass Effect trilogy. However, you really should start with Mass Effect, then move to Mass Effect 2 and then 3. If you start on anything but the first game, you will not understand certain aspects of the story.	2015-08-03

I was in the 7th grade when i purchased it. I saved up from birthday and Christmas money to get it. I thought i was saving up for a smart phone without the bills. What is it really? A PIECE OF CRAP! It takes 4 and a half hours to charge for a 2 and a half hour battery life. And that is only IF the dumb thing can make it to two hours. If you play on it for a long period of time the MG will over heat and freeze. And on top of that it will start to make an annoying alarm-type noise until the battery runs out. Parents do not get this for your kids. It may look fun, but this thing is a waste of money. I am a kid ,and faulty hardware is not on my list-o-fun! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!	2015-08-03

However, some of my buttons have started to stick a bit and I've had to clean them out with alcohol twice so far.  Ultimately, It would be nice if they could design a controller where crap couldn't get wedged around the button and interfere with its movement.  The touch pad on the controller is an interesting feature, but in my case, I hardly used it.  When I do, I usually just press it as another button versus using it as a touch pad.	2015-08-03

I have always liked Turtle Beach headsets. They are hands down some of the best headsets on the market for console gamers. I have owned many headsets from them and I have always been beyond satisfied with the product. They have always been of very high quality and worked flawlessly with no issues. With that said, I am completely and utterly astounded at how disappointing the 800X turned out. I feel like Turtle Beach has done a complete 180 with this product and forgot that they were designing it for the Xbox. Yes the sound quality from the headphones are great, they are super comfy, and you don't have to worry about wires going to your controller or those crappy mic adapters, but unfortunately these are a complete flop for use as a gaming headset. First of all, hidden mics are terrible! Why on earth would you not put a boom mic on an Xbox headset? While I was playing online my party members would constantly tell me to speak up. I had the mic set to the quiet room mode and I still had to shout in order for anyone to hear me clearly. Additionally, the mic monitoring is also pretty bad and it sounds like I'm speaking into a tin can. Both are far cries from my old Earforce Seven Pro and even my X12. The other issue I have been having is that every time I put the headset on charge I have to do a hard reset when playing the next time because the headset won't turn on. It turns on just fine when its not put on the cradle but for some reason putting it on the cradle completely messes everything up. Now I'm a pretty tech savvy guy, so naturally rather then returning these right away or complaining about them I looked up my issues in google and sure enough there's a software patch that fixes these issues. But guess what? Turtle Beach disabled the firmware update before I purchased this $300 paperweight! They took it down 7/17/15 and as I write this review (8/3/15) the firmware update is still unavailable. I'm very disappointed with you Turtle Beach. I'm not waiting any longerand I have already put in my return request.<br /><br />TL;DR - Headphones sound good, super comfy, mics suck, frequently freezes, no firmware update. If you're going to buy this check to make sure they put the firmware update back up before doing so!	2015-08-03

If you loved Xillia 1, you will enjoy the slight differences of gameplay and characters in Xillia 2.  The fight system is still flashy, but also different with the new hero's &#34;Chromatus&#34; mode.  Ludger also has THREE weapons, and depending on who you link with, you will explore many variations of his linked artes and mystic artes.  You will be able to play with all your favorite characters from the first game, now taking on different roles 1 year after the original gameplay.  Unfortunately, unless linked with Ludger, we don't get to see any other special linked mystic artes (other than Jude/Milla who are defined as the game's OTP).<br /><br />The Original Soundtrack is rougher here, as you are now playing a character from Elympios, and Motoi Sakuraba's edgier sounds are well displayed in addition to all the familiar themes from major Rieze Maxian destinations, like Nia Kherra, Hamil and Kanbalar.  You have to remember that Elympios is technologically savvy and more cosmopolitan than any place in Rieze Maxia.  They've also depleted their spirits so most places are barren deserts outside of the cities so their world limited to a few major destinations.  But there are softer tones to the main character Ludger as well, and the &#34;Hymn of Proof&#34; and the story behind it will make you roll into fetal position unless you have no heart.  In that case, no worries then.<br /><br />Each character from Xillia 1 has sidequests in Xillia 2, and as the new guy on the block Ludger learns more about them by traveling with them as they in exchange help him complete his quest to save the world.  The game may feel a little &#34;rehashed&#34; from the first, but you definitely get to explore more of Elympios this time and the story behind the two worlds as well as battle new quasi-villains in the tradition of Tales games.<br /><br />The storyline is kind of a downer and in the end, your choices define both the level of affinity between Ludger and his new friends as well as the ending.  There are four endings that I've counted and none of the endings are really all that great.  You're forced to choose and the producers wanted you to feel Ludger's choice keenly, whatever it is.<br /><br />If you're new to the Tales series, you might be missing out on some of the subtle Tales themes, but the characters are all very likable and the battle mode ranges from &#34;easy&#34; to &#34;unknown&#34; and you can switch it anytime you're stumped.  If you like JRPGs generally, questing, gathering, and grinding, this will be your cup of tea.  After 90+ hours of gameplay and three different endings, I still occasionally go back to the coliseum to bash monsters because I really loved the characters and the Xillia universe.evel of affinity between Ludger and his new friends as well as the ending.

Bought one of these a while back and it didn't work at all. After replacing the device through Amazon, my urge to use it had passed so I only connected the replacement to verify that it worked as the first device wouldn't even connect. Since the replacement connected, I stupidly thought all was good.<br /><br />I waited about a month and a half to finally try and use this hybrid controller again and it connected fine. I was able to get the mouse to &#34;work&#34; somehow as I couldn't quite determine what activated the motion controlled mouse or how to deactivate it.<br /><br />As long as the mouse was not activated, most of the keyboard functions seemed to work. Anytime I accidentally activated the mouse functions I was not ever able to switch back to keyboard though.<br /><br />At this point, I just figured I needed to learn how to use the device and all would be good.<br /><br />So I connect the device to my PS3 and move the left analog stick and the devices activity light (light on controller that shows data communication) locks in the &#34;on&#34; position. I was not able to power the device off or do anything else from this point on. I disconnected the dongle and was able to power it off at this point.<br /><br />I then Tried connecting the controller to a PC and installing the software. It didn't matter though. Anytime I touch an analog stick, the controller freezes.<br /><br />I'm not stuck with a brick still searching for my controller keyboard combo.	2015-08-03

With the announcement of the new Turtle Beach Elite 800X headset, we at Chalgyr's Game Room decided we would take a minute to share the love and wealth of some of their other gear, in this case the Stealth 500X for the Xbox One.  Here is our take on this vaunted brand's oft-praised headset.<br />When I received the 500X I squealed a bit; there it was, a beautiful (if rather compact) box containing one of  gaming's most popular brands and it was all mine. I popped open the box and just took it in; packed tightly into its shipping container, the 500X was sitting nice and snug with that new electronics smell. I loved it. Once I pulled out the few cables, receiver (did I mention it is fully wireless? Oh yeah, it is fully wireless and it is glorious), the headset and a few decals and the startup guide I was literally tripping over my coffee table in my haste to get it plugged in and charging. Fortunately the headset had about a 1/3 of the charge on it so I was able to plug it right into the Xbox One's rear USB port and the optical porta and I was on my wa.<br />The headset feels compact and tight; everything about it feels tense, like a beast waiting to be unleashed. The band is stiff, but pliable and never uncomfortable. The cups feel solid and are a little on the small side but after even four or five hours of The Withcer 3: Wild Hunt I felt no discomfort. The headset is gorgeous, with sleek lines, excellent accent piping, and feel solid and durable while maintaining a light and comfortable feel. Honestly Turtle Beach must have employed some sort of wizardry while building it as I have never seen/felt a headset that was both lightweight and heavy all in one, but the 500X is certainly that.<br />Even on the 1/3 charge I managed about 4 hours of gameplay before it died but I did notice that  as the headset's battery came closer to no charge there was a definitive *click* in the audio; it was quite annoying but once I charged the headset and went back the following day to play some Battlefield: Hardline online I did not experience it again. (*UPDATE NOTE* After E3 finished I was playing some Gears of War Ultimate on the Xbox One and as the headset neared the end of its charge the clicking reappeared; I believe that it has to do with the headset not being able to adequately power the various modes, the wireless connection, the microphone, etc. and it is dropping the broadcast power to simply power the unit. It ONLY happens within the 5-10 minutes prior to the headset shutting off)<br /><br />Within about five minutes of putting the headset on I could see why Turtle Beach is the market leader in console headsets; the 500X is rock solid and delivers some excellent 7.1 DTS surround sound and superior build quality. While there are numerous modes that you can set the headset in, essentially switching through pre-made equalizer settings, I did not find one that I loved more than the other (they were all quite nice), I personally could have gone for a little more bass, but to be fair I could always go for more bass.<br />Whether I was watching Avatar, playing The Witcher, or perusing YouTube, the Stealth 500X accurately recreates audio in crystal clear fashion. The real winner though? That would be the microphone. Most of the microphones I have tested for the Xbox One feel muted, shallow, or lacking any true depth of clarity. Not so with the Stealth 500X; crystal clean audio without the hiss or high popping of some of the more sensitive brands (PDP mics run a little hot) and when I would excitedly shout inot the microphone there was no distortion; it really is the best feature of the 500X (not to discount any of the other qualities though!).<br /><br />Turtle Beach has had a stranglehold on the accessories market for years now and if the upcoming Elite 800X is anything like the Stealth 500X things will not be changing anytime soon. Their high manufacturing standards show in the rock solid and near-magical construction of the physical unit and the crisp, clean audio reproduction really do show that Turtle Beach has the gamer in mind when they develop and build their hardware and the Stealth 500X is an excellent representation of Turtle Beach's dedication to the gamer.oming Elite 800X is anything like the Stealth 500X things will not be changing anytime soon.

Clearly an evolutionary edition of the controller, but still - it's absolutely the version Microsoft should have put out in the first place given the changes bring it inline with the ever-aging 360 controller. Crazy. This new model changes the bumpers to be basically exactly like the 360 controller (i.e. you can press them anywhere, not just frustratingly on the edges like the first-gen XBOX One controller, and they're easier to press, too), and the controller adds a dedicated 3.5mm jack.<br /><br />The rest of the controller is the same, which means if you like the general XBOX 360/One controller layout, you'll like this controller. Finally the bumpers are not a nuisance!<br /><br />5 stars out of 5.	2015-08-03

My 5 star rating is for the actual cable itself not its functionality. The materials used to make this all feel very high quality.

I honestly see no difference at all from this and the standard cables. 480I and 480p to my naked eye look identical in every manner. I still after all these years why in the world Nintendo would release this as a SD console. It is painful to try and go back and enjoy old titles at times because of how terrible the pixels look. Anyway, this is a great cable and for the price why not upgrade? I just question if it is really an upgrade from the original.	2015-08-03

Btw those are amazing Kontrol Freeks! Went 30 or more with those. Back on track so I got these a few days ago. I put them on my controller and next 10 games I go 40 kills and no more than 10 deaths. I only used them for 10 games because if you play with them too much they might damage. The main reason I took them off is because I want to use them on Black Ops 3. I recommend these if someone wants to become better at FPS games. If you want a better explanation add me on Xbox. GT: CHI Wonderz	2015-08-03

It makes messaging friends and communicating with friends on MMORPGs like FFXIV so much easier. Setting it up is a breeze even if you are just slightly tech savvy. Even For those who don't consider themselves tech inclined, the Nyko Type Pad for PS4 comes with a thorough instruction manual that Will lead you step-by-step. The orange coloration of the text and symbols helps identify the keyboard in even dimly lit areas but the buttons do not glow-in-the-dark like even though it looks like it would, so using it in total darkness isn't ideal unless you're the type who memorized a QWERTY keyboard layout. This product has completely changed the way I approach sending messages on PlayStation 4. My Only real complaint isn't with the product itself but with the time it took to ship it. When I placed my order back in May, the product was set to arrive at the end of June. I pre-ordered it, thinking a preorder with secure me the item but then the end of June came along and suddenly the product information page read &#34;Out of Stock&#34; and the ETA for my Amazon Prime eligible order went from the end of June to &#34;Between July 25th to August 3rd&#34;. This inconvenience did not impact my enjoyment of the product but the wait was way beyond the Amazon 2 Day shipping promise and seemed to undermine the point of preordering. What's The point of pre-ordering a product if you're not going to get it on the day it comes out, right? While I waited for the Nyko Type Pad, I could have went with a variety of other type pads that were readily available. Overall though, this is a review of the product itself and because of that, I stand by my 5 star rating ^_^	2015-08-03

I recently bought one of these specifically for my Genesis 1, and was surprised since it does seem to work well, no weird sounds due to low voltage or anything, BUT it heats really fast.

I tested with my SNES and apparently it works well too. I recommend the adapter since it works ok, but you may avoid extensive playing.	2015-08-03

Heck, Hatsune Miku is so big that she has her own live concerts around the world. If you do not know who Hatsune Miku is, she is a fictional singer that uses japanese vocals created by a vocaloid program. While Hatsune Miku has plenty of games in Japan, Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is her first video game debut in Western soil.<br /><br />Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is rhythm game that has you pressing the PS Vita's face buttons and d-pad, as their respective icons fly onto the screen, the icons will play along in time to the music. There are also sections within the songs that require you to swipe the touch-screen in time to the music, which those icons appear as stars. The game's mechanics are a little bit more simple than others in the same genre.<br /><br />Dependending on when you tap the buttons you will get different point values. There is awful, bad, safe, good, and cool. There is a Song Energy Gauge, that increases with every good and cool you get. If you do not keep up with the rhythm and get a bunch of awful and bad, the gauge will decrease and you will fail the song. Thankfully everything is perfectly responsive, which is a definite for games in this genre that relies so much on rhythm and skill.<br /><br />This game will definitely put your rhythm skills to the test, some of the songs on the &#34;Standard&#34; difficulty can be tough. The game includes a &#34;Beginner&#34;, &#34;Standard&#34;, &#34;Hard&#34;, and &#34;Extreme&#34; modes - the latter will make grown men cry. To make the game even more challenging you can enable special &#34;Challenge Items&#34; which let you earn more points. For example one of the most difficult challenges is called Perfectionist which will make you lose song energy if you get anything other than cool, ouch.<br /><br />The game includes over 30 music tracks that each have their own music video. I have not mentioned this yet, though there is more than just Hatsune Miku. There are 6 different singers that appear in their own music videos, there are even some duets. These characters include,<br /><br />- Hatsune Miku<br />- Kagamine Rin<br />- Kagamine Len<br />- Megurine Luka<br />- Kaito<br />- Meiko<br /><br />All of the songs available on the base game are pretty darn catchy. After I would go through one of the many songs it would get stuck in my head and I could not stop humming it. There is a song in particular that all of you guys should know that is in the game, that song is Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!<br /><br />I mentioned that each song has their own music video, all of these videos are really well made and visually pleasing. Unfortunately the first time around you will not really be able to pay attention to the video since you have to keep all of your focus on the incoming button prompts. Luckily after you complete a song, you can the watch song's music video with no distractions in the &#34;Watch Video&#34; mode.<br /><br />Outside of the &#34;Rhythm Game&#34; mode there are plenty of other modes to play around with. Some pointless and some enjoyable. The some enjoyable modes include &#34;Edit&#34;, &#34;Diva Room&#34;, and &#34;Shop&#34;.<br /><br />The &#34;Edit&#34; mode is surprisingly deep, it lets you create your own music videos, button prompts, and dances to any of the songs in the game or you can even use your own .MP3 collection. You can customize the background, choose any of the six characters and customize their dances and even their facial expression during every second of the song.<br /><br />The &#34;Diva Room&#34; and &#34;Shop&#34; go hand in hand with each other. In the &#34;Diva Room&#34; you can visit each of the singers apartment rooms and interact with the characters. You can become each singers friend by buying them gifts, playing Rock-Paper-Scissors, or petting them - the latter is strange, although that is not the reason I am recommending this mode.<br /><br />In the shop you can buy items with &#34;Diva Points&#34; that you earn by playing the game. You can purchase items that customize all six of the characters and their rooms. You can buy a bunch of different accessories and clothing, some cool and some goofy. The characters will even wear the clothing during the music videos and they will walk around in their apartment with the clothing on. You can buy a T.V. and a photo album for the apartments, which let you view and make playlists of the songs in the game and view photos that you unlocked.<br /><br />The pointless modes include the &#34;AR&#34; modes that let you have AR concerts and take AR pictures. Some people might be into this kind of stuff, though I was not too impressed with them. I was also not impressed with the load times, they appear with everything you press on the main menu. They are not terribly long but annoying.<br /><br />Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is a great game that most fans of the rhythm genre could enjoy. The gameplay might be too simplistic for experts of the genre, as it is pretty basic compared to other games. For people that are interested in a basic rhythm game there are plenty of songs to play which all of them are fun to play, challenging, catchy to listen to, and fun to watch. The game will give you plenty of replay value with the multiple difficulties to master and all of the other extras that the game has.h &#34;Diva Points&#34; that you earn by playing the game. You can purchase items that customize all six of the characters and their rooms. You can buy a bunch of different accessories and clothing, some cool and some goofy.

You can buy a T.V. and a photo album for the apartments, which let you view and make playlists of the songs in the game and view photos that you unlocked.<br /><br />The pointless modes include the &#34;AR&#34; modes that let you have AR concerts and take AR pictures. Some people might be into this kind of stuff, though I was not too impressed with them. I was also not impressed with the load times, they appear with everything you press on the main menu. They are not terribly long but annoying.<br /><br />Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is a great game that most fans of the rhythm genre could enjoy. The gameplay might be too simplistic for experts of the genre, as it is pretty basic compared to other games. For people that are interested in a basic rhythm game there are plenty of songs to play which all of them are fun to play, challenging, catchy to listen to, and fun to watch. The game will give you plenty of replay value with the multiple difficulties to master and all of the other extras that the game has.	2015-08-03

The System That The Casual/Nintendo 64/GameCube Gamer Woud Love.	I'm quite the gamer and I was really reluctant on buying a Nintendo system only because Microsoft and Sony have been dominating the industry in the last 5-10 years with the PS3/Xbox 360 and now Xbox One/PS4 era. Of course, this topic is very subjective depending on the way you have looked at gaming in the last 10 years. Sony and Microsoft have taken the reigns on pushing hardware capabilities and upgrading technology to push out Next-Gen graphics/experiences, which they have done quite well at.<br /><br />Nintendo has taken a totally unique approach, taking gambles by integrating different visionary technologies such as motion control and tablet compatability and bringing that to a greater light to the gaming industry.  The goal was to reach out to a wider audience, which they have done quite successfully.  They have been making very ambitious moves since the introduction of the nunchuck controllers, and focusing on the interactive gaming experience within the home rather than pushing the envelope in gameplay/graphics sophisitication.  This move has arguably put Nintendo as the King once again of last gen's consoles, however created quite a split and dilemna for both hardcore and casual gamers alike. If you wanted to be well immersed in the gameplay and the cinematics, you were a Sony/Microsoft man. If you wanted the ability to really share the experience to a larger group such as a family or a party audience to enjoy together, you probably wanted to get a Wii. Nintendo is a user-friendly experience.<br /><br />I digress. The reason why I bought this system is simply due to the fact that there were still games from the Nintendo franchise that I dearly loved, as well as people in my life that I wanted to share my gaming experiences with but were unable to do so because of the learning curve these other games have for the casual gamer.  It's hard to capture the interest of your girlfriend or certain family members who aren't quite interested in games or don't have thetime of day to really play to begin to learn the controls of an FPS/RPG/MMO/etc. However, it's very easy to get into a Super Mario, Mario Kart, Wii Sports, etc. That's where Nintendo thrives. They make it very easy and accessible for everybody.  So, buying a bundle such as this is nice because it comes with games that either I or a group of friends can hop right on and start to enjoy away. I also ended up going to Gamestop to pick up a couple of other items such as extra controllers and games so that I also have things I could enjoy for myself or with other core gaming friends I know online who play Smash, Splatoon, Zelda, etc. It's really nostalgic in some ways for me going back to my childhood and the Nintendo 64 seeing some of these other game characters that we grew up with still around and growing into what they are today. It's cool.<br /><br />One drawback I have on the Nintendo Wii U is the fact that since you have the tablet controller, you have two power adapters that need to be plugged in now instead of one. It's nice that the controller does come with stands to use for charging and/or display. Haven't bought too many games for the Wii U yet so hard drive storage hasn't been an issue for me yet. Another drawback that I feel is quite a letdown on the Nintendo consoles is that there is no ethernet port for those who like having wired connections to play online. It's cool that there are I believe 4 USB ports on the Nintendo, but I feel ethernet ports should be a default option in this day and age.  I did buy an ethernet adapter on amazon as well that you can plug into one of the USBs to get that wired connection capability. The latency improves alot with this as the Wifi isn't too great on this machine.<br /><br />Games such as Smash when played online rely heavily on the players internet connections, rather than actual dedicated servers that they would have for big games such as Call of Duty or Street Fighter. You may have good internet in your home, but that may not mean much if the latency on your system picks up on your Wii U. It's weird.<br /><br />I like the fact that Nintendo atleast went 1080p on this system. Kind of sad to hear that Wii U hasn't done that great in sales and has already announced working on a new system soon I believe called the NX. So IN MY OPINION, if you're not really that interested in getting a Wii U and you can wait about a year or so, I'm sure Nintendo's next move might be a show stopper. I'm praying on it. Wii U has been greatly overlooked but you have to give them props for 2 things.<br /><br />1) Being able to connect with a wider audience.<br />2) Backwards compatability (gaming and hardware) haha.	2015-08-03

I felt uncomfortable playing this game because ever five seconds, the enemy swears by loudly saying &#34;F*** YOU!&#34; And I&#34;m pretty sure even Ryu, the playable character, is muttering the F-word because he wishes you played better. Normally I'm not phased by swearing but I live in an apartment now...  The game is violent and it demands you execute the enemy with extreme methods. I noticed very little sneaking about in the game, again due to my poorly playing it. It reminded me of the classic game series on NES but &#34;Ancient Ship of Doom&#34; this is not. It's a shame that the other games in the  NG  series are not on Wii U nor the 360 exclusive Dead or Alive franchise which also stars my main man, Ryu!  Though I have to say even though he wears his modern costume for the series, but it doesn't seem legit. Razor's Edge doesn't make much sense. For some reason Ryu's arm is possessed or something by a blood thirsty demon. You button mash the crud out of the controller's buttons and stuff happens, but maybe too fast for me to understand what I am doing. I sorta felt myself going into a trance sort of and smiled at all the gore and blood flying around.   The one thing it does have that its older siblings on NES had is &#34;cheap&#34; difficulty where many of the enemies will use kamikaze attacks, tackling Ryu and blowing themselves up with a bomb. So you have to just mash the buttons until an enemy is bloody, THEN mash them extra hard 'til they are dismembered by Ryu.	2015-08-03

It plays like all the other inFamous games, although each one has a slightly different gimmick in the powers of the main character - but this time time you have a  lot more!<br /><br />The story sees an unwilling character suddenly given superpowers, and like in the last games, you have opportunities to choose being doing good and doing evil. The things that work well are the cast of characters who are all good and well acted. They also look like real people. Like, really real people who don't have model good looks or super fit bodies. I'm impressed by this nod to realism. The game plays very easily with a selection of powers that you can develop equally or just concentrate on your favourites. With a little patience you can defeat all the enemies you encounter with relative ease. Bosses are more challenging but will all fall if you pay attention to what you're doing. Auto saves are plentiful, and it's especially nice having mid-fight checkpoints in the longer boss battles. On this note, the main villain of the game is an absolute monster, really well characterised and acted, and I played the whole game specifically looking forward to bringing her down!<br /><br />The scenery looks great, the game is loosely based on Seattle although it's not quite as awesome as the copy of Chicago in &#34;Watchdogs&#34;, it does have some of the city's flavour. It's not a super long game, but it's never boring, and I really liked it.	2015-08-03

Before reviewing the product, I need to say the seller - eForCity - was great.  Responsive, helpful, willing to make things right even at their expense.  Kudos to them.  Unfortunately, the product left me very disappointed.<br /><br />The main issue is the battery packs seem to be manufactured by people who can't comprehend how it will &#34;snap&#34; into the Wii remote.  When installing each one, the part that makes contact with one of the batteries can easily break, as it's not angled the right way to slide in.  The first one I put in was a struggle, but the second one broke.  eForCity sent me a free replacement, and that one would have also broken had I not used pliers to reshape it a bit.<br /><br />The second issue is once nestled in the charger, I've found the remotes can easily lose contact and stop charging.  Unfortunately, when that happens it turns blue, which is what it does when they're finished charging.<br /><br />Finally, you can't leave the charger plugged in unless you don't mind blinding blue LED light 24-7.  It stays on even when there's nothing in the cradles, and there's no on/off switch.  It needs to be unplugged.<br /><br />Considering all the hassles, it's probably easier to just use rechargeable batteries.	2015-08-03

These cases look just fine and it is easy to place the game discs in the cases. Unfortunately the PSP does not recognize there is a disc inserted when the case is placed in the PSP. Tried with all three replacement cases I received and got the same result each time. I put the game disc back in the old cracked case and the game worked just fine again.

This zombie hula girl has good details and is my type of humor. Only problem I have with this product is that the plastic it is made out of is not very tolerable of heat. I live in Texas and it gets pretty warm in my truck and the plastic gets soft and she basically gets really flexible and bends over... nullifying the bobble novelty. Weak ankles. I'm sure she would work great in the cooler part of the year but for now, I will be putting her somewhere inside... where zombies are always trying to get anyways.	2015-08-03

The landscapes and how you can just see everything around you is breathtaking. I have played most of FF games released besides ones on the Nintendo line only, and this was okay. I wasn't invested into the characters as previous FF games; where something happens and you are arguing with the TV. Har har! The story was okay, not the best in all of the series. It was interesting to have the monsters as the 3rd party member. Make sure to level and fuse them!! I love to use the adornments on them too (love me some little chocobos!). The battling was good because you could have 3 different types of monster types to create a party of different strengths and abilities. And it was so easy to switch between battle combinations of characters in battle. Side note: if you buy xiii-2, buy lightning returns or the ending will just make you mad. Trust me I am glad that I did or I would have been fuming!	2015-08-03

Codes are updated from time to time and works with new releases as well. Added mac support would be great I had to keep my old netbook for this to work properly. Unlike the old gamesharks from back in the day it doesn't mess up your game and even if you go get issues with your save file being corrupted the device can actually make back ups anytime you apply a code so if something goes wrong you simply restore your save file. It's completely safe but as I mentioned the wire is terrible (should be fixed in new version) and if you have a mac don't bother.	2015-08-03

Played for a very long time, within the upper 2 digits of hours, and I am totally sick of the game. Be it the dull, repetitive side quests, uninspired main, plain hack n slash combat with little reward, and the game feeling like it wants to look every last cent out of you with pointless content additions and needless subscriptions. Servers are clumsy, and I felt myself getting booted off every 45 minutes at the longest stretch of time. Scenery is quite attractive in many places, but exploration feels pointless and unrewarding due to total lack of &#34;true elderscrolls-y&#34; content, like small caverns, smashed camp sites and quality loot. Game's &#34;lore&#34; material is lazily added in by packing &#34;lorebooks&#34; in every corner of the world.  Weapons and armor are interesting enough to look at, and the crafting system is well out together, although very confusing when starting out. Loot in the world is never anything interesting; no mystical named weapons and armor like what is found in true Elder Scrolls titles, and gold can be very hard to come by considering the cost of most all in game items. Justice system is there... but it is poor. Guards cannot be killed and lockpicking makes players stand; breaking out of stealth for all to see...  In all honesty, this may sound like a massive whine-fest but there really aren't many pros to outweigh the almost endless cons. A real shame too, considering Bethesda put their name on this nightmare. Absolutely stay away from this title, you won't miss out on anything besides getting made a chump of by these big publishers milking every last time out of you.  3/10: wait until it's $5 in a few years, it may we worth the money by then.	2015-08-03

It has the added bonus of also working with Windows computers through the included USB dongle and will also work with anything else that supports a standard 1/8\\\" headphone/headset adapter. That includes mobile devices running Android as well as iPhones and Macs.<br /><br />The bass is loud and evident even in the standard mode. There's a second audio mode that gives a little more boom but it comes at the expense of overall audio clarity. The default mode is good enough for me.<br /><br />The biggest issue with  AG7, however, is the included mic. The pickup level is very low, meaning you are going to sound very distant during in-game chats. I found this to be the case both with the Xbox One and my Windows PC using the wireless dongle. Plugging in via an analog cable to my Mac resulted in louder audio, so I suspect there's a setting on the dongle that's limiting the mic's audio output.<br /><br />The mic mute indicator is also confusing. For some reason PDP decided the light on the mic should indicate which audio mode the headphones are in, not the mute status of the microphone. It will indicate mute with a blink every minute or so, but it would have made more sense to have the mic light up red when muted. It also won't mute when it's retracted back into its holder.<br /><br />If they can fix the mic issues I will rate this set higher. It really does sound very good but it's not the total package it is currently advertising itself to be."	2015-08-03

Most importantly, it works with my PS3 -- immediately upon deployment it was clear it fit more snugly and securely than its competitors and I wouldn't have to worry anymore about USB plugs slipping out or failing of detection.  At first I couldn't get everything to work in every port but I assume it was user error, once I did something I'm not sure of it all worked perfectly afterwards.  Was a great relief to get this because I was banging my head over the fact that our PS3 games that warranted multiple plug-ins couldn't be played, and I couldn't find a USB hub extension that worked reliably.

I'm not sure if it will work for all systems, I've heard other purchasers say it didn't work for them, but I had no such problem. The game is in English and is really indistinguishable from the American version as far as I can tell.<br /><br />With all that said, this is game is fantastic. I put off playing for several years because I didn't purchase a Wii. My desire to play classic Nintendo titles and see what new they had to offer led me to purchase a Wii U and gave me the chance to catch up on 10+ years of Wii titles I'd missed. This game is a gem in the Legend of Zelda series and stays true to it's roots while implementing a really fun control system that actually works pretty well. I thought it would be gimmicky to swing the Wiimote like sword but they've done a really good job with it. I highly recommend this game for Legend of Zelda fans and anyone looking for a great Nintendo Wii experience.	2015-08-03

I was expecting much, much more seeing how Nintendo had so much momentum with the launch of Amiibo going forward. The Amiibo mode for this game is very confusing and puzzling.<br /><br />This game is NOT for the competitive player.

US	26944618	R234OF6DMFF92Y	B00IPTUJ8G	834259807	Borderlands 2	Video Games	4	1	1	N	N	If Diablo and a first-person shooter fell in love and made a baby	Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter with a mixture of role-playing elements that make it stand out in todayâs oversaturation of generic first-person shooters. You play as one of 6 vault hunters, each with their own unique skill tree and special abilities. You complete quests, beat enemies, defeat bosses, collect various kinds of loot, and gain experience points to level up your character's various skills and abilities. If Diablo and a first-person shooter fell in love and made a baby, Borderlands 2 would be that baby.<br /><br />Some people might fear that the controls will not be all that good considering the the PS Vita has less buttons than its PS3 counterpart. Well controlling the game works just fine on the PSVita. I can do everything that I can do with the PS3 controller with ease. The game has many preset controller layouts for you to mess around with or you can just change everything you want with a completely customizable layout. Some functions use the back touch pad and it is not terrible. For you to use the back touch pad you have to touch closer to the middle (From the left or to the right.) to activate one of the two functions so there should be no accidental presses, at least from how I hold my PS Vita. I customized my control layout to be more like Killzone: Mercenary controls and it controls just fine.<br /><br />Borderlands is known for it's unique cel-shading styled graphics and the graphics look great on the PS Vita. I was amazed that they were able to recreate one of my favorite PS3 games on the Vita and still make it look good. Do not think it is the same quality that you will find on your PS3 though. There had to be some changes so it would run on a portable system. The draw distances are shorter, not as much detail, and no ragdoll physics for enemy deaths ( They just explode with blood going everywhere and the body disappears.). To me, even with those tradeoffs the game still looks great.<br /><br />The game has a ton of content to play around with. There are a variety of different quests that kept me hooked on for the entire time. Heck, I still have to do more side-quests and complete the DLC content that came out for it. Speaking of the DLC, this version comes with 6 of the content packs that came out for the PS3 version. You will get the first two campaign add-ons, (Captain Scarlett and her Pirateâs Booty and Mr. Torgueâs Campaign of Carnage), Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho characters, along with the Vault Hunter Upgrade pack and the Collectorâs Edition Pack, which increase the level cap to 61 and gives you some new heads and skins for your characters. Unfortunately absent are two campaign DLCs, &#34;Tiny Tinaâs Assault on Dragon Keep&#34; and &#34;Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt&#34;; also missing is the &#34;Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade 2&#34; which increases the level cap to 72 and the all of the &#34;Headhunter&#34; packs.<br /><br />The game even comes packed in with online cooperative play. Though it might be a deal breaker to some, it is limited to 2-players. I do not mind it though as I think it's good enough for the lesser amounts of enemies in a area compared to the PS3 version (PS3 version might of had 14 enemies there but the PSVita only has 10 for an example.). Plus it's less people trying to steal your precious loot.<br /><br />Playing through the game I did notice some bugs and framerate drops. The drops in the framerate do not happen enough for it to ruin my experience with the game, although it is a little worse in co-op. Do not get me wrong, it could be better. Hopefully future patches can get rid of some of the framerate drops. The only other problem I had would be the load times. The PS3 had long load times also and the PS Vita's load times are just little longer that is it, just a little.<br /><br />Borderlands 2 for the PS Vita is nearly identical to the Borderlands 2 that was released a couple of years ago. So if you already own it then you are just paying for the option to play it on the go. If you never played it, definitely think about getting this game. You'll be getting a game filled with a huge amount of content that you can take wherever you go.

I'm a Godzilla fan and hated this game, it's a cool idea having all the monsters from all the movies in this game, but it just does not translate well at all in this game, or needed alot more time to develop, the mission levels get boring and old after each level destroying the same nuclear reactor over and over again, then fighting a monster.

Have you ever played a video game that you thought was such a terrible experience that you wished it hadn't ever existed or hoped that not many people have caught onto it? Unfortunately, Game Party is the shovelware series that millions of Wii owners fell victim to in the first place, allowing it to leech onto our beloved console even more for clueless, innocent buyers to purchase for family-friendly fun only to fall to their knees in frustration from the near-brokenness of what they just purchased.<br /><br />Game Party 2 continues the trainwreck-of-a-minigame-collection idea that Game Party gladly used to scam victims out of their wallets. There are eleven activities this time, but considering that around nine of those eleven share almost literally the same exact control scheme on paper (&#34;Press A in this stance to prepare tossing the object, then go over to THIS OTHER stance and RELEASE A to toss the object!&#34;), it's pretty much all just a bunch of filler.<br /><br />Development on Game Party 2 was obviously as lazy as ever; as if the reused idea of throwing games wasn't enough, the motion controls are slightly improved, but are still just about nonfunctional at times, and while I'd like to say the graphics still look like as if they were from the Playstation 1-era, I think that would be insulting that gem of a console, as I've seen it do better in terms of graphic capabilities. The sound is....well, it's sound, but much of it at least was reused from the last game.<br /><br />Honestly, who keeps thinking it's a good idea to shell out these wretched &#34;party&#34; games that aren't even accessible to their target audience thanks to their horrendous controls and lousy presentation? The most confusing aspect of this is that FarSight Studios is a development team with talent, if their amazing pinball video games are of any consideration. If anything, you should buy Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection for your Wii instead of any one of these Game Party travesties.ty travesties.	2015-08-03

This is not a gane meant to be enjoyed by all or attract new fans. This is a fan service to diehard Godzilla fans like myself. With that being said the game is poorly bananced in the beginning but all of the monster become stronger as they grow taller.<br /><br />The monsters animations, models, etc look very much spot on and Godzilla has never looked better. The recreation of our favorite fight scenes and the mechanics - you move just like the monsters! - make the game well worth purchasing if you are a fan.<br /><br />next the city graphics have their moments but for the most part the maps are still too small and they look like well miniature sets so I know that was the developers intentions, but had the cities looked just like the trailers most game review sites would have given it a much higher score.<br /><br />Now to conclude my review if you loved Godzilla as a kid, you will love this game.I have already put 30 plus hours into it. Gamespot harping on the lack of content yet other games getting smashed in 6 hours get better reviews? 2d side scrollers get better reviews? bottom line this game didnt have a big budget and its fun to play. This is the best fab service to Godzilla fans in years.	2015-08-03

I have used these for about a month now and I am very happy. my previous headset was a Logitech G230, a very average headset. These headphones opened up sounds I had never heard from my video games before. Frequency response is excellent. Build quality feels solid all the way around.  I wish the earcups were a bit bigger, but the foam used is soft and comfortable. The mic actually coils up neatly when not in use, and has a red LED light on the end to tell you if it is muted. Headset arrived in a simple brown box. No software was included, but following instructions, got the Synapse software from the Razer website in 2 minutes. Everything worked perfectly out of box, and I didn't notice any scuffs or scratches on the headset.<br /><br />Pros: Excellent sound, construction feels solid, good mic clarity, nice LEDs on the ear cups, heavy duty USB cable<br />Cons: Bigger ear cups would be nice.<br /><br />I paid $65 for these, and I feel they are an excellent value for that amount of money.	2015-08-03

The most noticeable change is the 3.5mm jack to connect headsets and the LB/RB buttons. I don't use headsets with the Xbox One so I can comment on it. The LB/RB buttons are now much, much easier to press and the feedback you get from them is better as well. I just wished they changed the glossy black plastic around the finger and Xbox buttons for a matte one but this is just a minor taste preference.<br /><br />If you play games that require heavy use of the LB/RB buttons or need a new one, you should definitely get it. Otherwise, there is little incentive to change a working controller right now.	2015-08-03

I was apprehensive when I ordered this, because of how many options are out there and because of the potential compatibility problems with my phone and tablet, or the apps I wanted to use with this controller. Not only did the manufacturers succeed in replicating the exact tactile feel of the original game pad, but the battery life is outstanding so far, and the game pad's method for pairing (and re-connecting) is very straightforward. There is no latency between when you press a button and the resulting action, making it completely seamless while gaming. A great addition to my mobile gaming rig, and a nice price as well.	2015-08-03

US	452646	RS8QLLHTWQZX7	B00006LEMK	40042399	Suikoden 3	Video Games	4	0	0	N	N	Great classic RPG fun	Years ago my above friend did something that Iâve never looked back on or once regretted. He sold me his PS1, which was my move away from Nintendo based consoles for quite a while. Sometime after this he introduced me to what is pretty much a cult classic: Suikoden II. Fast forward another few years and I bought my brotherâs PS2, making it my own. Louis came over throwing Suikoden III at me before he was heading out of town for a weekend. While I enjoyed Suikoden II, it to me didnât hold a candle to Suikoden III, which was my favorite entry in the series until the release of the fifth. Back once again, Konami have re-released Suikoden III on the PSN, making it playable for both the PSIII and the Vita. While physically sitting on my shelf, it has been too long since Iâve picked it up. Being able to review it now is an honor.<br /><br />Suikoden III was special for more reasons than the above stated. The third entry into the series went through many changes from the previous two as it took advantage of the power of the newer PlayStation 2 moving from a sprite base over to 3D models and environments. This allowed for characters to show expression in more than just dialog boxes, creating a much more of a cinematic approach within gameplay like a lot of that era tried for before voice acting became more commonplace. While graphically moving in another direction, an anime-like opening cutscene was still used as a lot of RPGs did, but was now in even higher quality both in terms of sound and visuals. Exceeding Love, the opening theme of Suikoden III, perfectly fits the opening sequence and the overall feel of the story which is deep, rich, and at a lot of times heart heavy with the actions that some must take whether they want to or not.<br /><br />Having gone a different route than the rest of the series, Suikoden III is the only entry in the series that features three main protagonists with separate story lines as well as several playable sub plots. Now while the idea of separate plot lines can be daunting at times since generally what happens is that players would be replaying the same events over and over for maybe one or two different story segments, this is far from the case. Each of our three characters all have chapters of their own and can be selected from the starting Trinity Site in which players are brought back to on the return of a finished chapter. This site allows for the player to choose the next chapter of either the same character or that of another. With this in mind, it is not possible to finish the entire story with solely one character as everything is intertwined. Each main character story must reach a certain point in order for everything to continue moving forward again never leaving any doubts as to what is happening.<br /><br />Actually, thatâs a lie! There are a lot of moments in which players might be thinking âwhat is going on?â until much later when all of the pieces truly fall into place. Here are three completely separate people, from completely separate backgrounds and cultures. Biases, hatreds, and misgivings between some is more than expected when one group tends to think of the others as uncivilized barbarians. GENERALLY though, following all chapters will paint a proper picture of the events unfolding as the chapters happen at roughly the same time or slightly prior showing how things came to the point that you are seeing or have seen. For anyone not having played, even if it is a much older game, Iâm going to say that Iâm not touching anything story related as just about anything could be a spoiler for something else! One thing that should be noted however is that being an older RPG, save points are not exactly the most common at times and when you sit down to play, prepare for several hours worth of game time as sometimes, thatâs the minimum between various cutscenes and battle segments.<br /><br />Combat is probably one of my favorite parts of Suikoden III. Using a six member party, players set up their characters in groups of two for a total of three groups. The manner in which groups perform depend entirely upon who is paired with whom at times as it can make essentially a landslide of difference in battle capabilities. Actions that can be taken in battle range from physical over to magical in abilities as well as the option to simply attack. Using a form of movement, the playerâs party and the enemy party will need to move between themselves and each other in order to hit their targets. Units that are mounted on horseback essentially have more chance of making it if there are a lot of enemies on the field in comparison to someone on foot.<br /><br />Where things get really cool is when you start collecting more characters for larger parties and experiment with who gets paired. The best example of this is one of the main characters Hugo and his griffon Fubar. Side by side in different groups they will go about attacking as they see fit alongside their partner or solo depending on the size of the group. When paired together however, Hugo rides Fubar which leaps up into the air and flies to the target and together they do a lot more damage at the expense that they only perform one action. With a total of 108 different possible characters also known as the seriesâ Stars of Destiny, there are a lot of possibilities in mixing and matching characters for various outcomes.<br /><br />On completion of a successful battle, every present character receives experience points. I know right? Who would have thought with this being an RPG and all. Why this is a bit more important is that only two series that I can think of have done away with incremental experience caps and instead decided that characters simply need 1000xp in order to level. The first is the Suikoden series and the second was the .Hack series. Just 1000xp? Thatâs it? Thatâs it. Obviously nothing is ever that easy though as weâve all come to know. Each character level is a simple 1000xp with modifiers that are put into place as they gain levels. At a certain point in time it no longer becomes possible to level off of certain creatures as there is essentially nothing left to learn and experience must be found elsewhere in more danger stricken territories.<br /><br />Like Combat, Skill and Magic work interestingly enough. Using a form of letter grade, both of these types of abilities generally start off in the range of D, E, F, which would mean that the character has an idea of what their doing, but they arenât great at it. Using points gathered in combat, either type of ability can be upgraded at a shop that offers its services in that field. Upgrading one of these abilities allows for several things. The first is that especially in the terms of magic, spells can be cast more times as the stock of what a character can perform before a rest in increased. Secondly the higher abilities within that tree are unlocked allowing for more powerful spells to be cast. Lastly though, this modifies the casting speed time in which a character requires to perform these actions within battle without worry as it is possible to be interrupted.<br /><br />Not every character is good at everything which should be kept in mind when looking at possible skills or magic to add. With 108 different people that makes a lot of sense. In the shops there is the ability to ask the owner to check compatibility. This will allow the player to better grasp how they should develop up a character. Some character for example can never be better than a D-Rank for water magic while others that excel can go all the way to either an A, A+. or S-Rank. If mistakes are made through or it simply makes more sense to add a different skill or magic type, these can be forgotten for another cost in order to start all over again. Not everything can be forgotten just as not everything can be learned. Finding out which is which is just as important.<br /><br />Suikoden III was released as a PS2 Classic and not as an HD Remake meaning that nothing was touched in regards to visuals, menus, resolutions, etc. The anime cutscene still looks absolutely impressive as anime does tend to age very well.

Never having played an Arkham game before I must say this was not a good first experience. I've seen gameplays of Arkham Knight and the big selling point for me was the ability to cruise around Gotham in the Batmobile. I assumed that I would have the same experience or at least with another Bat-vehicle in Origins. Well unless I have not progressed in the game far enough that doesn't seem to be possible. Also not even 2 hours in I'm noticing some glaring flaws. For starters the combat system is broken and not at all what I'd expect Batman to be capable of. Countering is spotty and the slow motion finisher feels rushed in order to add eye candy to the game. As for gameplay, the scroll menu using the D-pad for batarangs and such is near impossible to navigate. Im not kidding when I say I spent nearly 8 minutes just trying to get the hacking thing to pop up. Which brings me to my next point. That bat hacker thing is totally unnecessary and almost impossible to use. Another gripe: Navigating around Gotham is not what I'd expect as all you can do is run (bad idea unless you want a fight every 5 seconds) or slowly glide from one building to the next grappling here and there. Again I'm not to far in maybe you get a bat-cycle or something but so far navigating from place to place is tedious and cumbersome. The lack of mini map further complicates things tenfold. Minor gripe: The graphics are great during the cutscenes not so much during gameplay. Felt like I was playing PS2 All in all I'm really not happy with this game and am even skeptical about getting Arkham Knight.	2015-08-03

The sad thing is about a month into my usage the SVM feature quit working almost all together. I believe its a short or some issue with the wiring because if I bend the wiring leading up to my headset a certain way I hear a pop and I can hear myself but with a significant decrease in volume. If the wire moves I hear an even louder (ear-deafening) pop in the headset, and it would quit working again. Not only this but when I speak to people my microphones volume would all of a sudden drop as if I was whispering into my headset. Looking into the voice volume control setting in the PS4 and with the same settings I have always had, the system (PS4) barely registered that I was talking at all. The only fix was to un-plug the USB cable that runs from the controller box (The thing that looks like a router) to my PS4 and reinsert the cable back in. I have contacted Tech support on the issue but I have yet to hear back from them. So far its been 3 days.	2015-08-03

Okay, âexpertâ is probably a bit of a fraudulent stretch.  In fact, I certainly and objectively suck compared to the player who can perform a no-damage 30 minute speed-run of Bayonetta on the hardest difficulty whilst, for added challenge and absurdity, her hands are oiled and confined within 14oz boxing gloves.<br /><br />But I do play and enjoy a variety of hack ânâ slash titles -- those I can manage to get my mediocre mitts on -- from the mainstream to the niche and everything in between. These can range from mass peasant-spanking simulators like the Dynasty Warriors franchise to anger aptitude tests such as Ninja Gaiden Black. And after having the fortune of experiencing Onechanbara Z2: Chaos, I must tell you, my possible fellow hack ânâ slash aficionados, while wafting the energizing scent of my own self-satisfaction:<br /><br />If you donât mind the gameâs arguably welcome single-minded focus on insurmountable babes, impossibly durable bikinis, superabundant undead bloodshed, and donât take issue with incredibly linear level design as well as imbalances in level length, then you will discover a combat system in Z2: Chaos that, while not as complex combat-wise as the likes of Bayonetta or Devil May Cry 4, can be just as satisfying as its contemporaries within the genre.<br /><br />The story is an entertaining mixture of surreal nonsense: Two groups, the Vampiric Clan and the Baneful Bloodline, have been mocking each otherâs ridiculously ample bustlines and swiping swords at one anotherâs bikini breastplates for decades to determine which group is superior. But when a greater evil threatens to swarm the world in a mass of undead viciousness, two sets of sisters from the opposing groups decide to collaborate, traveling the world to eviscerate inexplicable henchmen in a stylishly frenzied manner. There is camaraderie, there are cowboy hats and there are a few jokes about overly ample bosoms channeled through a narrative told in still comic book panels. There is a girl in a dress who attempts to bonk our heroines in their faces with a spiked club because... I donât know? Sheâs apparently jealous of how they retain favorable hip-to-waist ratios despite eating like bear cubs deserted on a salmon farm (which is a almost certainly incorrect speculation on my part).<br /><br />The tale and its accompanying dialogue may be silly and campy and a bit scatterbrained, for sure. However these traits allows the game to make its awesome, ridiculous âbikinis slay the undeadâ premise a triple combination of lighthearted, occasionally self-aware, and charmingly low-budget, characteristics that compliment a few hours of leisurely stupidity after a stressful day of deadlines or competitive diaper changing (if youâre a maniacally organized parent, you might be into that type of diversion). If you require a storyline thatâs more cohesive, coherent, and thoughtful, however, then, well, you probably wouldnât be interested in an adventure about bikini samurais to begin with.<br /><br />If the story does happen to be too bare for expectations, then perhaps the combat will improve upon and make up for its impropriety. For as a masterful team of four â Kagura and Saaya, half-blood sisters from the Vampiric Clan; Aya and Saki, sisters of the Baneful Bloodline â you sprint from hallway to enemy horde, releasing whatever catharsis that may be harbored within with a variety of extravagant slices, punches, and special attacks that give the word âpandemoniumâ gainful employment.<br /><br />Now, each character has a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and sub weapon, all of which feel unique and can be accessed on the fly with the press of a button before, after, or in between any combo set you desire, allowing said combos to be pretty customizable in terms of attack order.<br /><br />For example, you have the basic weak, strong, and sub-weapon attacks â which are assigned to square, triangle, and circle, respectively â and when executing a weak combo sequence, which consists of tapping square in succession, you have the freedom to change up this basic combo by adding a few strong and sub weapon attacks into the mix. And when you return to the weak combo, your attack continues from where it left off in the original sequence, whether it was on the third or tenth animation of said sequence before you initiated the change up. So, while the move list may not be expansive, the combat can be a joy to experiment with for the sake of challenging yourself amidst a blouse-ripping five-hundred hit combo.<br /><br />Skirmishes become even more chaotic (hence the gameâs title, I suppose) when character switching, team attacks, and special attacks are set loose into the battleground: Pressing up or down on the D-pad immediately switches characters; smashing the touch-pad like a dishonored sells-word unleashes all four girls, each one synchronized to your input, each swing of their weapons colorfully coursed by the girlsâ unique auras at an unwavering 60 fps; and simultaneously pressing triangle and circle sets off each warriorsâ one of three (12 in total once theyâre all unlocked) special attacks, which range from Saayaâs crowd-controlling earthquake to Kaguraâs ability to spawn a doppelganger that allows her to accrue double damage. This all goes without mentioning how each character can briefly transform into hyper-erotic Super Saiyansâ¦<br /><br />But before I get too carried away with how delightful the combat can be, I must address a few of Z2: Chaosâ issues. Primarily, although the ladiesâ character models are lovely and detailed, and the enemies are oddly designed yet distinguishable, the stages are embarrassingly barren, poor representations of the real-world locations theyâre barely trying to parallel. Dubai, for instance, looks less like a metropolis stacked with ultramodern architecture and more like a colossusâ litter box, with its static sand dunes and â what the hell is that, a miniature Mayan temple?  On top of this, the stages suffer from length imbalances. One stage, or chapter, may take five minutes to complete, while a later chapter will take almost an hour. What this can do in a game that focuses on repeatedly punishing waves of enemies is add tedium to its formula by the end of the gameâs 5 to 7 hour campaign. Itâs not an issue for me, since I enjoy a good grind, but for some it could prove to feel more like labor than leisure by the time you reach the final stage.<br /><br />Onechanbara Z2: Chaos has its issues. Although it has a nonsensical story (which I enjoy), level design from the deep yesteryears of virtual entertainment, and stages that vary so wildly in length that I forget the day of the week, Z2: Chaosâ combat nearly renders all of these calamitous flaws silent. Itâs not the deepest, most intelligent, or most skill-intensive combat on the market. But it might be the most eccentric. And with the right mindset thatâs willing to embrace the zaniness and work around the possible weaknesses, it can be just as fun as the best hack ânâ slashes around.gned to square, triangle, and circle, respectively â and when executing a weak combo sequence, which consists of tapping square in succession, you have the freedom to change up this basic combo by adding a few strong and sub weapon attacks into the mix.

The box and instructions were all there.<br /><br />Overall the game is awesome. The races are quick, fun, and have a good variety. In single player there's a ton of tracks to play through as well as the track builder option which could keep you busy almost indefinitely. You play through the single player to unlock more unique parts for building custom tracks. It's very fun in that the tracks are fun to play even if you have no interest in unlocking parts. Some tracks can be really challenging but not at all impossible if you stick to it. It's very fun playing with others in the multiplayer mode as well. Everyone uses cars that are equal so it is all a matter of skill. The games are very competitive and great for a group of friends. The &#34;matches&#34; are short so you could play in a short amount of time or just keep playing if you have lots of time.<br /><br />The graphics are on par for other Wii games. The detail into the mechanics is above average for a Wii game and the controls are easy to master. There is no language or violence in this game and would be suitable for any age in that regard but from a difficulty stand point I would say that it would be best for ages over 12.<br /><br />Overall it's probably my favorite racing game for Wii along with Mario Kart Wii	2015-08-03

The sound is fantastic. The design is lovely. The comfort is phenomenal. But because there is something to complain about, I'll leave a more in-depth review.  First: buy a cord management system. If you're a PC gamer, you know why, but if you're a console gamer and sit closer than 15' from your tv, you'll need it too. The generous cord length is nothing to sniff at (it's probably very useful for anyone with a home theater) and if you have animals and small children, cord management is a necessity.  That being said, it's not a complaint. I bought a Dotz organizer as one reviewer recommended and it fits the bill exactly after some initial adjusting, I didn't have to worry about the surplus wiring.  DESIGN The u320 has a classic look to it that very much fits with a modern, sleeker (almost minimalist) theme. It's by no means bulky, and with a sleek black finish and smooth blue accent ring on each can, you can rest assured that you look as good as you'll game. (Personally, I showed mine off to my fellow gamers and hoped at least one of them would notice the quarter note design. None did.) If a product's looks weigh in on your decision to buy it, you'll love these.  COMFORT For some background: I'm used to EX-05s with metal bands, some padding, and some netting. And by &#34;used to&#34; I mean I wore them for a year until I couldn't stand it any more because of the headaches the headset gave me. When I looked for a new set, I immediately looked for comfort. I can handle crap sound quality as long as I can understand roughly what's going on. Imagine my joy when I found these: lightweight with larger cans gently padded. Still, I was skeptical - who knew what the pressure was going to be like.  It is virtually unnoticeable.  I put on the headset and was amazed. I couldn't (can't) feel any sort of pressure point of any kind, my cheeks and jaw don't hurt while wearing them, the headband is evenly distributed over my head... I wear glasses, and there seems to be a little gap specifically designed to keep the arms from pressing into your head while you game (which has been the cause of one too many headaches with my old headphones). The padding is nice and breathable, to prevent overheating ears, and there's plenty of ear space. I have large ears even for my larger head and don't feel the least bit bothered by the amount of space provided. You might fall asleep in these by forgetting you have them on in the first place.  DURABILITY But don't worry if you do, they won't fall apart on you. Despite the lightweight design, these headphones are built to last. The band is made of plastic that flexes easily but feels durable, should you feel like slamming your headphones to the floor in troll-induced rage. The foam padding isn't the type to crumble away, which is fantastic. Why some people call it composed out of cheap materials, I'll never know - you can twist the headbands a fair amount with no signs of stress and no hint of cracking. The ear cuffs feel pretty secure, given the wiggle room. The material doesn't feel cheap in least.  That being said: if you are one to abuse your headphones, you might not want to get a $170 pair in the first place. If you're not, go for it.  SOUND Full disclosure: I'm a musician as well as a gamer. Finding something that lets me appreciate the rumble of drums and sweet sounds of woodwind instruments is just as important to me as finding something that let's me hear footsteps and ambiance while playing.  I'm not saying your KDR will improve overnight. But with these headphones, you have the potential to adjust your settings to better suit your playstyle as well as enjoy the effort put into the score of the games you're playing. Killing a frost troll or slaughtering a horde of Fallen will feel that much more epic, and in Skyrim, dragons will cower before your Thu'um. This headset brings forth every bit of detail you could want, including things that normally get lost behind a roar or hail of gunfire.  It won't improve your KDR overnight. But it will let you hear things that may make that improvement possible.  And if you want to cheer with your friends over a raid, they'll hear you as clearly as you'll hear them. When you don't feel like listening to them, just adjust the chat volume and enjoy the game. When you don't feel like talking, just lid the boom mic. Speaking of which...  MIC You mute yourself my lifting the mic away from your mouth like you normally would. No, really, just lift the mic and they won't hear you. Lower it if you want them to hear.  There are controls that let you adjust the mic volume so you're not yelling in your friend's ear, a there is a talkback feature so you can hear how you sound to others. Both work as intended.  The noise cancellation is nice, though I play in a quiet environment and couldn't really test it out. My brother heard me clearly (he was playing upstairs) and other than the dogs barking directly into the mic noticed very little other noise. No static or muffling to note.  OVERALL Head shape will influence this, but these were amazingly comfortable to me. The sound coming out of the speakers was lovely and crisp, with every detail pronounced. I'm not even mad that these aren't Dolby Digital 7.1 or 5.1; I love them!  That being said, I'm kind of bummed they don't come with an audio adapter for the 360. If you're going to listen to the best, you're going to want to watch the best you can, right? So an HDMI cable is a necessity. It's a little thing, granted, but a thing it is. (I bought a $6 Trenro 360 RCA Audio and Digital Cable Adapter for myself and my brother, but other people may want to go more name-brand-y. Turtle Beach sells audio adapters for something like $15 an adapter.)  All in all, this is a fantastic product I would recommend to anyone who wants their auditory experience to be top of the line.  The two-year warranty should something happen isn't bad either.r.	2015-08-03

The current price decrease from $39.99 to now $25 (not sure how long it will be there), for Reaper of Souls is now worth it. TONS of changes occurred to Diablo III right before this expansion launched and boy, was it needed. A warn of caution when purchasing this through Amazon or other retail outlets: buy it digitally. Like World of Warcraft expansions, owning physical standard edition of games and expansions from Blizzard are literally pointless now. Since you HAVE to be online to play Diablo III anyway, you are just buying the Reaper of Souls expansion code to upgrade your Diablo III license on Battle.net. But onto what you get:<br />Ideally, there are 3 features added to RoS:<br /><br />1 new Class, the Crusader. It's an interesting class that's perfect for Diablo III and very reminiscent of the Paladin from DII. It has some very stylized abilities like the steed charge and stacking/passive buffs on their shields. But ultimately, nothing special compared to the Druid from DII LoD. Most players may play it once or twice then go back to the characters they put more effort into.<br /><br />1 new Act (ActV). This is the part that people had issues with and basing the entirety of the expansion on. Ideally you can beat this act roughly in 2-3 hours on normal difficulty. It was 9 hours for me to complete the act because I was actually exploring and doing as much as I can before the end and was on Expert and above difficulty because I wanted a challenge...Like you are supposed to. The story is nothing special as usual. In fact you don't really see the Malthiel (the boss on the cover) till literally the very end. New locations like Westmarch are impressive to look at and have more nooks and crannies to explore, even random dungeon instances which was needed terribly in DIII's acts.<br /><br />Adventure Mode. It is literally awesome not having to do the same acts and pressing the space bar to skip through the story dialogue over and over and over again. After completing Act V the first time, you can select this mode for any of your characters; new and old, Hardcore or Seasonal. You can pick any Act area of DIII and RoS and perform bounties or Rifts at whatever difficulty level you feel comfortable at.<br /><br />Overall, Reaper of Souls is a continuing effort from Blizzard to make amends with the backlash Diablo III received. As I finish this review, Blizzard has already added almost a year's worth of patches and new content. As of now, DIII is worth playing, but you'll have to make sure you install this. Adventure mode was sorely needed, but it's unfortunate that you have to buy RoS to utilize this. DIII could have used this back then to create longevity in the post launch Inferno days.this mode for any of your characters; new and old, Hardcore or Seasonal.

Well, I got hooked on Devil May Cry 3 as my first introduction to the series (which is actually the prequel to the others incidentally) and the ripped, bad-a** leather clad rockstar devil hunter Dante is just as cool now as he was when the games first came out. The games first came out and I got them on the Playstation 2 so the control scheme felt a little different on an X-Box controller but you get used to it. Yes, this to me is the ACTUAL Devil May Cry experience--forget the reboot universe; while a novel attempt it just doesn't match up to the original's storyline, gameplay challenge and soundtrack. In fact, the reboot series &#34;DMC&#34; was just....bizarre. Here, in HD goodness you can replay all 3 of the original series Devil May Cry and relive the gameplay and storyline that made the series so great!....Yeah, okay and the fact Trish and Lady are smoking hot on an Intergallatic scale ALSO helps the series for us guys but in all seriousness, the game collection was worth the money! :) On an ending note I highly recommend Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition as well.	2015-08-03

I have always been a fan of the series but, disliked Devil 4 so I was weary to check out the reboot but man I am glad I did. This game brings back the excitement I felt playing the first game. I personally dig the new Dante look and all. The controls felt fluid, the combos were a lot to take in at first but, once you start to play with the different weapons it opens up a lot. I really lucked out because I picked it up while traveling abroad for $12. SCORE. I have finished the game on Nephilim difficulty and thought what the heck I should be able to handle Son of Sparda mode and got owned in the first level but, my loss didn't make me want to quit. It made me want to retry until I got past the enemies which is rare nowadays in most games. Honestly pick this game up if you like a good brawler and missed it on last gen systems. Excellent game.	2015-08-03

It has a plethora of great games and a great looking 5-in OLED touch-screen that makes the colors look vibrant. The PS Vita is also the first ever handheld gaming system to have two analog sticks and a back touch-pad. There was some problems though. The system is pretty powerful, it touts a quad-core CPU, 512MB of RAM, and 128MB of VRAM. With that power, the battery life had to be affected. On a single gaming session it lasted about 3-5 hours. Also the back-touchpad was a little big, there was some accidental presses here and there; and the original PS Vita was a little heavy, causing some strain during long gaming sessions.<br /><br />The long awaited slim redesign of the PlayStation Vita has finally come out overseas. The PS Vita Slim lives up to it's name, it is about 20% thinner and 15% lighter. The weight and height differences are totally noticeable and as a result the slim model is much more comfortable to hold for a extended gameplay session. The system itself looks fantastic. It looks modern, with its rounded corners; and the build quality is great, it does not feel like a cheap knock off of its older brother.<br /><br />The PS Vita game slot is easier to access and has been moved to the middle at the top. The original had it on the top but to the right and to the left of it was a mystery port that was never used which is now absent in the newest model. Gone is also the proprietary charging cable which is now a standard micro-usb charger that you get with almost every handheld device that is not made by Apple.<br /><br />The battery life in the slim model is better than the original. The battery lasts a little more than a hour longer and pumped out gamings that were about 4-6 hours long on a single charge. The better battery life does come at a cost though. Instead of the originals beautiful OLED screen, the slim has a LCD screen. Yes, the LCD is not as vibrant as the OLED. The LCD still makes everything happening on the PS Vita look great. You can only tell a difference if you put the 2 models side by side. Honestly, I would rather have the longer battery life with a minor downgrade in screen quality anyday.<br /><br />The software portion of the system is exactly the same across both of the models. The LiveArea is still as quick and snappy as ever. You can play games, earn PSN trophies, download a plethora of games off the PlayStation Store via WiFi or usb transfer, surf the web with decent web browser, setup calendar events, read emails, look at maps, listen to music, watch movies, and view pictures or take them with the same poor quality 3MP cameras that are only good for skype.<br /><br />You can organize your games into folders. Each game has a LiveArea the the developers can fully customize with links to websites, news updates, leaderboards, and much more. Your friends can give a like or comment on in-game activities that you have accomplished within the LiveArea also.<br /><br />The PS Vita can also remotely connect with PS3 games and play a few of them or connect with the PS4 and play almost every game available for the PS4. Remote-Play works fantastically on the PS Vita and it works great as a second controller for the PS4.<br /><br />The buttons and speakers almost remain the same between the two. The buttons are in good locations and have a nice responsiveness to them. The Home, Start, and Select buttons are much better now. Instead of hard to press little ovals, they are now nicely sized circles that are now much easier to press. The back-touchpad has also received an upgrade. The touchpad is smaller which mean no more accidental presses. The speakers are still crisp and clear although they still lack in the bass department.<br /><br />As awesome as the PS Vita is there is still one glaring problem that both the models have, memory card prices. The slim model does have 1GB of built-in memory but it becomes useless becauseyou can not use it in a combination with a memory card. It's either the 1GB or the memory card, not both. Thankfully the slim model out now comes with a 8GB memory card and Borderlands 2, which is a great game. If you ever want to upgrade your storage just be prepared to pay a pretty penny to be able to afford the 16GB and the 32GB memory card.<br /><br />The PS Vita Slim is still a great handheld that has plenty of great games to play around with. Everything that Sony has changed is for the better with the slim model. It is lighter, thinner, and overall more comfortable to hold for a long period of time. It is still an attractive looking system with great looking screen, although not as good as the originals OLED. The battery life lasts a little more than an hour longer as far as gaming goes than on the original. The only huge downfall is the memory card prices which will make the system $50-$100 more expensive if you want to upgrade your storage. As of the time of this review, the PS Vita Slim comes bundled with Borderlands 2 and a 8GB memory card for $199.99 which is a fine price for what you getyou can not use it in a combination with a memory card.

Our 2014 Samsung already upscales enough to where the old Wii looked pretty good, but I though it would be fun for my daughter and friends to play Skylanders in better definition. This device won't make your old Wii HD or 1080, though you'll get something more along the lines of very good 720+. It was worth the $11 or $12. However, my 3 stars are because the plug is unnecessarily larger than it need be, so much so that plugging it into the back of the Wii means we had to take off the USB cooling attachment.	2015-08-03

Its a pretty good budget gaming mouse! The feel, comfort, and responsiveness are above what I would expect for the money (I paid 15$ for this on sale). I would recommend this mouse for MOBA games, casual gaming, or any other game that does not require a million buttons or faster-than-humanly-possible response time. Competitive FPS players may want to look elsewhere, but honestly your network will have much more of an effect on your K/D than any mouse ever could.<br /><br />I game on a mac and windows, and surprisingly the features on the extra buttons worked well on OSX, which is more than I could say for my razer bluetooth mouse.<br /><br />Also note, this mouse is probably best for the &#34;palm-grip&#34; type user, since the molding on the sides makes it somewhat non-ergonomic to hold with your thumb and ring/pinky fingers. I am a &#34;claw-grab&#34; type of mouser, so I ended up giving it to my little cousin who loves it.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the lighting only has a alternating mode that constantly dims on and off while switching colors, kinda like Christmas lights. I prefer to turn the lights off and save battery so it is a non-issue for me personally, but for those looking to color-coordinate their setup should take note.	2015-08-03

A sharp left turn from Metal Gears of old, Revengeance proves a tireless assault on the senses as developer PlatinumGames eviscerated the deliberate and lengthy stealth-play of earlier entries in favor of a full-on barrage of ultra-violent insanity.<br /><br />Metal Gear enthusiasts, rest easy: while MGRR's clear focus on lightning-paced, precision melee encounters eschews the series' foundations of tactical restraint, none its predecessors' tension or challenge is lost here. Gameplay is tight, unforgiving, and completely rewarding: while levels are fairly linear, combat is always varied. Take to the streets of a war-torn city and cut a swath of destruction through that army of mercs in front of you, or run up the side of a building (!!!) and rain death from above with a devastating lunge right into the unsuspecting crowd. Close-quarter sword fights are about as good as they come, featuring an endlessly exhilarating countering system and (the crown-jewel) a slow-mo free slicing mode which lets you cut your enemies to ribbons and use their battery-powered guts to recharge your cybernetic ninja powers. The boss battles are phenomenal, chalk-full of spectacular set-pieces and elaborate, multi-tiered challenges.<br /><br />Those hoping for anything more than Metal Gear fan-service out of the story in Revengeance will be disappointed. Picking up a few years after MGS4, an infinitely less whiny and brooding Raiden goes on a bloody quest for (lo-and-behold) revenge after a generic president of a made-up African country he's protecting gets assassinated under his watch. Cue a typical Metal Gear-esque convoluted conspiracy yarn about the world's need for a &#34;War Economy&#34;, introductions to ensemble of paper-thin and stereotypical supporting voices in Raiden's ear, ham-tastic villains, and Kojima humor galore. At a brisk four or five hours, Revengeance never outstays its welcome, though: the cut-scenes are shorter than any of the series prior entries, and the story is just as consciously ridiculous as the action. Sure there's plenty of BS in the narrative, but Revengeance is all about cutting through the BS with a razor-sharp katana, and super-charging itself on its battery-powered guts.<br /><br />These days, MGRR is a steal. New Game+ features are abundant, as are the ever-present Metal Gear VR missions. Free DLC packs for two supporting characters are fun, as well, and add another three or four hours of carnage to the already impressive package. It's a terrific game: Ninja Run to the internet and pick this one up!	2015-08-03

One flaw with both with are the open world map that mixes side quests with main story. It can become very difficult to find where your main story thread had left off if you stop playing before you've solved the main story. Speaking of the main story for the first time in any LEGO game I've run across the main story is shockingly incomplete, there is no Battle of the Five Armies third film content not if there any true resolution to poor Bilbo Bagins Quest! After defeating The Dragon in a manner that will make fans of LOTR literature or films baffled and appalled at the limits of LEGO retcons, the credits roll! I was shocked. Given the nature of X Box downloadable content and the move to turn a one time purchase into a series of future buys, I expected there to be a Hobbit 3 expansion game in the future. Like most LEGO GAMES certain characters can do certain things you need to advance the game and solve puzzles (sadly 70% look nearly identical), if you try to use an equal character in freeplay you most likely find that you can't finish a boss fight if you forget who was in the original story mode. You also have difficulty getting side quest character to realize and reward you for finishing said side quests. This game is particularly choosy about how you may used ranged weapons and inconsistent distinctions between sling and bow, you have very little freedom even in freeplay (but then it's nearly impossible to keep unlocked weapons without digging through inventory each time you swap). One new element to the game is clearly inspired by Minecraft, you need to collect, not only money studs, but raw materials for making things (many of the side quest are getting plans and supplies to do just that). So you'll spend twices much time picking things up.  But hats off for LEGO designers for including TOM BOMBADIL who missed all 6 film adaptions (even Radagast made a few), granted his special power is digging and growing but, mah.missed all 6 film adaptions (even Radagast made a few), granted his special power is digging and growing but, mah.	2015-08-03

On the off chance that the name doesnât ring a bell, they are the developers for Temco Koeiâs Warrior series. Dynasty, Samurai, Orochi, we are all pretty big fans of and that doesnât include Hyrule Warriors, Bladestorm, Toukiden, the upcoming Dragon Quest Heroes.<br /><br />So with all that being said, I donât know how One Piece Pirate Warriors avoided me for so long. My initial response at the announcement of One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 was honestly âThere are two others?â. Within not very long I set out to find the first two and thankfully they were happily placed upon the PSN where I promptly jumped into them as they were infinitely easier to find than physical copies which in some cases were as much as a mortgage for some reason. Being just slightly behind in the Manga as I like to read arcs as a whole without the weekly cliffhangers, returning over seven-hundred chapters back to the beginning was a nice refresher.<br /><br />The great thing about a Warriors game is that there is always something new whether it be big or small. One Piece Pirate Warriors is no exception with Luffy and his Crew put into somewhat of a Musou style. Instead of going about a full blown warriors game with over a thousand KOs per map, things were interestingly different both in good and frustrating ways depending upon the situation.<br /><br />Going about a different direction than a lot of the core Warriors series entries, One Piece instead uses the main characterâs abilities for a lot of action, adventure, and light puzzle solving. For those that do not really know what One Piece is, it is a weekly Shonen Jump entry alongside the likes of Bleach (Death Gods), Fairy Tail (Wizards), and the recently finished Naruto (Ninjas). Itâs about a bunch of crazy pirates in which some have eaten fruits that grant them powers at the cost of not being able to swim. The main character Luffy D. Monkey is in this boat as heâs eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit essentially turning his entire body to Rubber. Using this idea as a core, Pirate Warriors is essentially split into two different portions. The first is a good old Musou style conquering areas and defeating bosses while the other is an action-adventure-puzzle that uses Luffyâs rubberized body to get through it all.<br /><br />When it comes to the straight up Warriors sections, Pirate Warriors does everything right. If I had to put an approximation I would say that about ninety-percent of the time players will be using Luffy with some quick segments with other characters especially later on in the game. Combat itself is fluid with a bit of Samurai Warriors mixed in for combos being based off of both the Square and the Triangle button instead of just using one or the other for a finishing move like a lot of the other entries. This definitely allowed for a lot more versatility especially since you had only the one character for the majority of the game.<br /><br />Supplementing not being able to change your main character is the option to partner up with other members of your crew when they are available. By doing so, Partner Strikes open up allowing for them to switch places with Luffy for the duration of a combo attack. To set up a partner strike, a specific combo is listed beneath Luffyâs health bar. By performing this combo and then hitting L2 when the option arises in slow motion on your screen, you instantly change places for some rather large scale enemy destruction depending upon the partner. On a general basis though, any Partner Strike is a good Partner Strike. By repeatedly using these as they become available, a meter filled up on the partnerâs portrait. Once filled, the next Partner Strike will also unleash a Musou attack for maximum efficiency.<br /><br />Hereâs where things get a bit better and worse. The inclusion of a different style of levels was a great idea. Using Luffyâs rubber body, players can extend their limbs to slingshot themselves over larger distances, reach high ledges in order to make it up and over obstacles, extend over a gap in order to pull down bridges, etc. On these stages the fighting is much less as the platforming and the puzzle challenges are really what are being highlighted. What can kind of get in the way however is that sometimes it could take a few seconds and backtracking could be required. While this is generally the norm of things, some platforming elements are just too much to be repeated that often in that short amount of time especially if you miss your cue and fall down having to restart. The main example of this would be the monkey bars. Using a full combination of L1, L2, R1, R2 Luffy needs to hit the appropriate ones in sequence to make it over. Thereâs one level in particular that after six times I had more than enough and just wanted to get to the boss fight.<br /><br />That leads into the other half issue. Boss fights could be both amazing and amazingly frustrating. The frustrating boss fights are those that have no mechanics to them but instead are a full out brawl. These generally have Luffy up against foes that should technically be able to pull off a one hit kill with how strong Luffy is at that point in time. These battles can be very long even after learning the attack patterns as one wrong move can send you to the game over screen.<br /><br />Boss battles with mechanics attached to them however are much more pleasant and generally fun to play. These battles contain options to throw things at the boss in order to get in a coup de gras or a bit of platforming elements to dodge devastating attacks. If anything can be said though, it is that there is a lot outside the norm when it comes to Pirate Warriors which boils down to being pretty standard for the general craziness of One Piece.<br /><br />Not being left out there was one more feature that was included amongst everything else which can mostly be seen between the Boss fights and certain Platforming segments. Quick Time Events (QTEs) are used mainly in boss fights to show off some cinematic fight scenes to spice things up in an epic anime showdown fashion that One Piece and a lot of Shonen Jump (Dragon Ball Kamehamehas included) are really known for. In platforming they are used much less until the slingshots or the monkey bars are put into focus. I these players have to as mentioned above hit the right combinations or risk falling down which is generally into water. Since our powered up Pirate canât swim, we really donât want that.<br /><br />One Piece Pirate Warriors came out a few years ago back in 2012 with itâs sequel Pirate Warriors 2 in 2013. While it may be slightly older, it doesnât quite yet fit into the retro section so I will be giving it a score. Honestly even with the bits of bumps that it has, Pirate Warriors is a good game which shows off a decent amount of innovation attempted by the team in order to do something wacky like One Piece justice. Iâll be back soon with Pirate Warriors 2 as I get ready for next months Pirate Warriors 3!yers can extend their limbs to slingshot themselves over larger distances, reach high ledges in order to make it up and over obstacles, extend over a gap in order to pull down bridges, etc. On these stages the fighting is much less as the platforming and the puzzle challenges are really what are being highlighted. What can kind of get in the way however is that sometimes it could take a few seconds and backtracking could be required. While this is generally the norm of things, some platforming elements are just too much to be repeated that often in that short amount of time especially if you miss your cue and fall down having to restart. The main example of this would be the monkey bars. Using a full combination of L1, L2, R1, R2 Luffy needs to hit the appropriate ones in sequence to make it over.

The people making this title were obviously sick of cutting old sprite art out and did a lousy job because of it. Very few times I was entertained by this game and it gave a total play time of 15 hours which is pathetic! The game only makes an effort to showcase the ending levels and boss' of retro games that no child would have the patience to get to. It makes no effort in any other regard. when I bought this I had no idea it was a later game in the series but after playing it that was way too obvious. If you can, just rent this title, never ever buy it like I did. You'll be wasting your money if you do.	2015-08-03

I have had this system for about a month. So far so good no problems with it. The only draw back I have found is the games take a long time to install if you leave it hooked to the internet. You can speed up install time by disconnecting form the internet and just buy the physical games on disc. And then just hook the system back up to the internet when the game has fished installing. because you will need the internet to download any updates for games of system. And I like this system because for me there is a bigger selection of games.  That I like to play But that's me.	2015-08-03

Controls are intuitive, but it can be hard to get into - I had a lot of trouble figuring out why I couldn't switch characters, and you unlock far more levels than you can play at first.

Maybe people just like the nostalgia of it? Maybe people don't remember how great the original NES controller is compared to this. Maybe people have never used an original NES controller so don't know any better.  I honestly have no idea but as soon as I started using this I knew something was off. I remember using a NES controller from 15+ years ago. I still distinctly remember the weight of the controller, the feel of it, and how to use it.  Right off the bat I could tell this thing was lighter but that's forgivable, I'm sure with more modern technology they were able to do away with a lot of unnecessary (by today's standards) components. The feel of the controller isn't quite the same but again that's also forgivable, I'm sure it's difficult to get something 100% right.  What is unforgivable is the horrible D pad. Yes, horrible. At first I thought it was something I was doing wrong, like maybe I forgot how to properly use a NES controller. I remember being able to flawlessly transition from pushing right to pushing up without ever removing my thumb from the D pad and it would work perfectly; my character would go from moving right to up without a hitch.  With this controller though it's a total crapshoot, it might work perfectly or your character might just keep moving right even though you are now pushing up.  I read a review from another person that summed up this problem perfectly. The problem is if you push down on the center of the D pad the entire D pad moves down, as if you are pushing all 4 directions at once, and that's the problem, you don't want the whole D pad moving down at once.  I pulled out my original NES controller and sure enough, just as I remembered, it was impossible to have the whole D pad move down at the same time if you push the middle of it. The D pad is bound to be leaning towards one direction if you push down the center, meaning only one direction is pushed at once.  I bought a NES controller/USB converter so I could plug my original NES controller into my computer and it is exactly how I remember playing my original NES. The D pad works flawlessly. The buttons work flawlessly. It is perfect.  If you can put up with a poor functioning D pad then this product is alright, it's a bit cheaper than the converter plug alone so it has that going for it.  However if you actually want to enjoy your games I highly recommend buying the converter plug. If you don't already have a NES controller I would recommend paying the extra money to get one and the converter plug. This product is just absolutely aggravating to use.	2015-08-03

You begin by getting off of a small boat in the tiny port town of Amihama during mid 19th Century Japan. What do you from this point on is entirely and literally up to you.<br /><br /> I have to preface this by saying that there is just about nothing serious in the tone of Way of the Samurai 4, other than the time period and the changes that Japan was going through. Never taking itself seriously, there is a lot of fun to be had - especially if you donât mind the crazy characters and townspeople that you can run into while strolling about the town in nothing more than boxer shorts. Yes you read that right. I forwent the Kimono and traditional Japanese underwear for a pair of blue and white striped modern day boxers. I eventually found a long pipe to go with that as I strode around bare foot, surprisingly never being looked at twice. Guess I wasnât the weirdest person there with all the British wearing their dresses, three piece suits, and top hats.<br /><br />Before being left entirely to your own devices, there is a prologue that offers to teach players the basics in the form of being told what to do by a common townswoman. Then again, considering that she teaches you both basic and advanced moves by yelling at you as to how to do themâ¦ I seriously wouldnât want to meet her in a dark alley as she knows what sheâs doing. While the basics may be simple with light and heavy attacks, dodging and blocking, putting them into play will be an entirely different story and will take time to get right.<br /><br />While a lot of the dialog, character personalities, and random townsfolk fall into the weird, fun and quirky categories, combat takes itself very seriously. There is no goofing around for this samurai and his weapons. If you fight and your enemy and lose, youâre Dead.<br /><br />Game Over Man, Game Over.<br /><br />This took me a bit by surprise the first time that it happened as I had barely gotten my feet wet so to speak. I accidentally chose dialog in the opening fight making myself surrender as I tried to quickly yell a taunt, was then tied up and thrown onto train tracks, saved but lost everything that I carried, and then picked a fight with a side quest mark after having told a woman being stalked that I would up put a stop to it. I faced the stalker while being barehanded and lost. Miserably...<br /><br />Once faced with the dreaded game over screen I realized one of two things. A) I had to get better and not suck so much the next time and B) Way of the Samurai 4 almost has a Roguelike element to it as any experience in martial art styles and weapon forms are kept and carried forward along with a few other little things on your next attempt at life. Starting right back on that boat leading up to the docks, players can once again decide to follow the same first decisions or go about another route.<br /><br />Once back and into the tutorial fray I actually decided not to sully my blade but instead use my fists of awesomeness and toss my enemies around like ragdolls until they couldnât move anymore which is another of the charms that showed itself. Swords arenât everything and different weapon styles or lack there of are just as fun as one another.<br /><br />Way of the Samurai 4 in a lot of ways made me think of Akibaâs Trip in the way that you have access to an entire town at all times to do really whatever you want to do. Once you are taught the basics, the town is at your fingertips. At this point I honestly stood there taking everything in and wondering to myselfâ¦ what do I do now? Iâll be honest that open-ended / open-world games are generally not my thing as I much prefer to play something with an actual direction that provides distractions but also a clear course. So what is one to do? I went after thugs for a good while better my armed and unarmed combat skills while picking up money and other weapons to disassemble or sell.<br /><br />One thing that didnât take long to notice was that if Iâm really going to last against tougher foes then I was going to need a better weapon. Enter the very well oiled and muscular man that happens to be the Blacksmith. Here is a man that can make modifications to your weapon by upgrading the base strength to making it harder. Like everything that Iâve been through of late there is a catch to performing such a feat and that is that by upgrading the strength of the weapon, you decrease its durability. Honestly, this felt more than a fair trade as I didnât have to swing or block as much to even kill some certified badasses that what into town after a few events. Being on par with them was more than worth it.<br /><br />Fighting in the streets was generally not an issue depending upon the part of town that you could currently find yourself in. Fighting in the wrong part of town however, the upper quarters, it didnât take long to get yourself arrested. This is another part that just felt like it was off the wall and made me wonder where they got their ideas. So getting arrested I figured wasnât so bad until I found myself tied up, again as it wasn't the first time, and then suspended upon a spiked wooden horse.<br /><br />The wooden horse itself is not a very pleasant torture device, being a torture device and all, but adding spikes on it was just cruel. This became a mini-game of sorts as you had to balance yourself under the torturerâs whip but also stay above the horse. Eventually flames were turned on, she would lash out with a kick and then I figured âalrightâ Iâll pass out when my health drops to zero. Oh no. I died. Again. What is this Dark Souls? Alright, back to the boat! Time to start again...<br /><br />For all the interesting systems that Way of the Samurai 4 has in place it also has a few smaller issues. One of the ones that actually annoyed me a bit more than I thought it would was that the voices and the movement of the mouths never really seemed to match up. Now if this was a case of an original Japanese game and English voices then that is something that most of us are so used to that we think nothing of it. In this case however we have a Japanese game with Japanese voices and it was honestly rather distracting as that just about never happens.<br /><br />While exploring the town it could feel at times that things werenât exactly where they were âmeantâ to be.

In certain casesâ¦ that wonât be long.ombat skills while picking up money and other weapons to disassemble or sell.<br /><br />One thing that didnât take long to notice was that if Iâm really going to last against tougher foes then I was going to need a better weapon. Enter the very well oiled and muscular man that happens to be the Blacksmith. Here is a man that can make modifications to your weapon by upgrading the base strength to making it harder. Like everything that Iâve been through of late there is a catch to performing such a feat and that is that by upgrading the strength of the weapon, you decrease its durability. Honestly, this felt more than a fair trade as I didnât have to swing or block as much to even kill some certified badasses that what into town after a few events. Being on par with them was more than worth it.<br /><br />Fighting in the streets was generally not an issue depending upon the part of town that you could currently find yourself in. Fighting in the wrong part of town however, the upper quarters, it didnât take long to get yourself arrested. This is another part that just felt like it was off the wall and made me wonder where they got their ideas. So getting arrested I figured wasnât so bad until I found myself tied up, again as it wasn't the first time, and then suspended upon a spiked wooden horse.<br /><br />The wooden horse itself is not a very pleasant torture device, being a torture device and all, but adding spikes on it was just cruel. This became a mini-game of sorts as you had to balance yourself under the torturerâs whip but also stay above the horse. Eventually flames were turned on, she would lash out with a kick and then I figured âalrightâ Iâll pass out when my health drops to zero. Oh no. I died. Again. What is this Dark Souls? Alright, back to the boat! Time to start again...<br /><br />For all the interesting systems that Way of the Samurai 4 has in place it also has a few smaller issues. One of the ones that actually annoyed me a bitmore than I thought it would was that the voices and the movement of the mouths never really seemed to match up. Now if this was a case of an original Japanese game and English voices then that is something that most of us are so used to that we think nothing of it. In this case however we have a Japanese game with Japanese voices and it was honestly rather distracting as that just about never happens.<br /><br />While exploring the town it could feel at times that things werenât exactly where they were âmeantâ to be. Running around I would be hitting into other people and making them mad for ânot watching where I was goingâ even if it looked like there was more than enough space between us.

The reason why I really liked the first one was because it didn't take much coordination to play, but when this one got to the first Perry vs. Doof battle, this game became just like a classic platform game, and it was so hard that I had to hand it to my game-savvy brother to beat, and even he found it difficult. I was sort of thinking, &#34;Okay, but I can enjoy the levels between Perry battles, right?&#34; A few minutes later, they threw in another platformer, and I wound up frustrated all over again. It was about then that I put it down.<br /><br />They did improve one thing from the original, though-- they changed the way the &#34;busted meter&#34; works, so that Candace gets mad when you could potentially get hurt, and not when you walk around. She does scream &#34;PHINEAS!&#34; which gets very annoying.<br /><br />In short, if you liked the first one and you're good at platform games, you'll probably like this, but I didn't. Seriously disappointed.	2015-08-03

Now the bakery produces food(bread), that can be hauled to cities and consumed. Or the wheat can be hauled to a cattle yard which will &#34;grow&#34; cattle and then you can haul the cattle to a meat packing plant. And the meat plant produces food to haul to cities.

This is a must buy I mean two games for the price of one?  Who can beat that. I only played bo2 and so far I'm loving it. It a lil bit of a learning curve for me. Mainly because I'm coming from playing ghost. =0 she played ghost!  Yep and tbh it was good but got boring after while. I wanted a new experience for once.  Bo2 is very different (well for me) I now own four cod series, mw3 (which is ok) ghosts (I use to love but like now) bo1 ( never played yet but probably will in the future) bo2 ( so far I'm learning but may be my top pick now). Zombie mode seems ok like I said I'm still learning, so don't judge me lol.

Rest Mode now works with drives larger than 2TB!!<br /><br />Very fast, plug and play and works perfectly with [[ASIN:B00FQH7MQ2 Seagate 4TB SSHD SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive (ST4000DX001)]] with one caveat; \\\"Rest Mode\\\\\" does not work with this 4TB SSHD. (See update above - Rest Mode now works!)<br /><br />I tried the Nyko with a 2TB drive and everything worked perfectly, including Rest Mode. It's the 4TB size that the Playstation 4 does not like in Rest Mode. I just shut down the PS4 completely and problem solved.<br /><br />***IMPORTANT - You need the 800Mb PS4 update file - NOT the 250mb file, otherwise it will not reinstall the operating system and fail. [...] - Click on \\\\\"DOWNLOAD NOW\\\\\" to get complete 800mb file.<br /><br />Other than that, it is an Excellent product, very highly recommended!<br /><br />Clarification : If you use Rest Mode with this 4TB drive, your Playstation 4 will not wake properly; it will wake in Safe Mode and go through a disk check routine every time with sector errors. Just shut down your PS4 completely and problem solved.<br /><br />This is not the fault of a 4TB drive - any drive above 2TB will do this. It is a Playstation 4 limitation. Perhaps a future PS4 firmware update will fix this problem, but for now, 2TB is the limit to Rest Mode. (See update above - Rest Mode now works!)"	2015-08-03

US	49869329	R12XOATHDBZRYX	B00CJXYU9S	845895071	The Evil Within	Video Games	4	1	1	N	Y	"\"You Look as Though You've Seen a Ghost\": A Flawed, Striking Journey Down the Good Ol' Rabbit Hole"	An atmospheric, pulpy love-letter to the genre he helped establish, Shinji Mikami's The Evil Within pays its homages in full, even if it struggles at times to get its own story straight.<br /><br />Detective Sebastian Castellanos and company are thrust into an unfolding and utterly disorienting nightmare after getting called in to investigate a mysterious incident at a local asylum. Soon enough, the white-washed walls of the nuthouse are repainted red with blood, a hoodie-wearing albino specter is killing everyone in droves, and Sebastian is getting chased around by deranged denizens of an eerily familiar remote countryside village. We've been here before, but, then again, that's the point: the Evil Within isn't trying to break new ground so much as it tries to renovate the old mansion. Combat is challenging, enemies are fast, puzzles and traps are abundant, and boss encounters ooze dread in a way that more than makes up for latter Resident Evil entries' failings: this is root-level survival horror evolved.<br /><br />While the Evil Within's grainy, grind-house visual palette and terrifically detailed environments are immersive and appropriately unsettling, its abrupt and often confounding story-line gets muddled quite early on. Even after the predictable twist is finally spelled-out in full, the game doesn't quite manage to pull the pieces together as well as it should. Characters, unsurprisingly, aren't particularly interesting or well-defined outside collectable journal entries, and our villain's motivations are ultimately a letdown.<br /><br />That said, the game manages to push past its flaws in interesting ways, like engrossing mid-level location transitions and terrifying enemy design work. While adversaries all feature fantastic animations, it is a bit off-putting getting around as Sebastian early on in the game: between his flailing melee attacks and noodle-armed limping, Sebastian provides just as many laughs as his ghoulish pursuers elicit scares. Equallyhilarious is the atrocious dialogue on display: when a vicious, half-naked, spider-legged woman bursts out of a pool of blood on the ground a few hours into the game, Sebastian asks &#34;What's with you lady?&#34; completely unfazed. The voice-acting ranges between lazy (Anson Mount's Sebastian), sleepy (movie star Barry Pepper as Ruvik), and underutilized (Dexter-alum Jennifer Carpenter as Sebastian's new partner, Juli). Luckily, the sound-design more than makes up for the misfires in the casting department, offering a rich audio backdrop to the unfurling terrors at hand.<br /><br />Along with a now perfunctory New Game+ mode, three enormously fun and equally atmospheric DLC expansions do a nice job building on the lackluster lore the main game's plot initially scuttled. &#34;The Assignment&#34;, in particular, caters to the game's strengths, and does a great job dropping the spotlight on Sebastian's female partner, Juli. The main game itself spans a good 14 chapters, each an hour or less in length: the levels themselves are well varied and rarely redundant. Resident Evil and Silent Hill fans will find a lot to love here.	2015-08-03

I'm not reviewing how much this helps or hinders gameplay, while it undoubtedly is more comfortable than the bare thumbstick I find the benefits to precision to be negligible but other people swear by them. I'm going to assume you have already decided to buy grip covers/extenders and therefore will only be speaking to the quality of the product itself and why I find this exact item superior to similar products. You likely have seen the products made by KontrolFreak selling for about $15 a pair. The grip here are just as good at what they sell and for a fraction of the price. Additionally since the set comes with five different styles in three different heights you can experiment to find what you feel most comfortable with. The grips stay on without any adhesive and have a nice rubber feel that adds grip without feeling sticky. They don't interfere with normal control function. I personally like the concave  design with the dots around the edge and four triangles in the center. Not all brands are made equally. Beware of the 'silicone' grips being sold in a number of colors (often in a pack of 10 to 20) which can be identified by the eight bumps on top of the grip. These frequently fall off and because they are silicone they can be a bit slippery. Finally to save on production costs these don't come in any fancy packaging, instead you will receive them in a resealable clear plastic pouch.  [Update: The grip face does apparently wear out over time not unlike the tread of a tire. I currently have subjected my chosen favorite pair of grips to an estimated 1500+ hours of use but the wear is definitely noticeable , especially on the left thumb which is used more. They are still useful in their current condition and this hasn't  changed my opinion or rating But it should be mentioned they may eventually need to be replaced if your going to use them heavily. This may or may not be a issue with products from other companies (none of which make the exact design I've grown fondof)]  PROS - Comfort - Value - Large variety of styles included - Designed to not accidentally fall off  CONS - Would have liked to see a 6th control grip that was in the shortest size with a concave top. - Largest size has questionable practicality - Durability after extensive use (well over 1000 hours)  Pack includes 5 different designs - Short with studded grip top (basically height of original stick) - 2 Medium height, both slightly concaved with a center pattern and either a ringed or studded edge (personal favorite) - 2 Large height with concave top or studded grip top  Overall highly recommended for the casual or hardcore gamer, as well as everyone inbetween!	2015-08-03
