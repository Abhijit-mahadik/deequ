My other asics are the gel noosa tri 9, and I have those in a 10, so I would recommend Going up a half size. These are pretty light weight but have lots of traction. They'll be great for my climbing and light hiking. Love the pink and black.	2015-08-01

I usually don't write reviews but I have NEVER been this disappointed from buying something off Amazon.  Upon arrival, the box and case all seemed genuine. Even the frame looked great and new. HOWEVER, upon holding it, the pair of glasses squeaked like no other!!! Not only that but the whole frame's quality was terrible. It felt like the hinges would snap or the lenses would pop out anytime. I am extremely disappointed because I thought Amazon would not sell fakes but I am wrong.  At first, I was a bit afraid of ordering because after reading many reviews, it seems some frames were fake and problematic, but I thought I would take a chance anyways since there were so many great reviews. (However, now I question whether these reviews came because the buyer never owned an authentic pair of Ray Bans before to compare..). But the hinges on this squeaks so much, and the entire frame seems like it can break any minute!  As I never owned a pair of Ray Bans and to make sure I wasn't delusional, I went to a Sunglasses Hut in my local mall to compare the frame in store to the one I received (exact model), and none of their frames had this problem. They all felt different- much stronger and better made!  Overall, I strongly STRONGLY recommend others to not buy Ray Bans from Amazon and instead go to a store and buy it :( I know it seems a lot cheaper here, but the difference in quality is worth it, and most importantly you won't waste time and money returning a fake product like I am &#62;:(.	2015-08-01

I almost never have a problem with shoes being too narrow, so I was somewhat surprised.  I also didn't like the way the heel rubbed in the back.  On the plus side, the shoes appeared well made and the arch area was well supported and comfortable.  So for the right foot, these would probably be great.

I purchased two pairs of the grey/white/orange/red sneaker in size 11 for my 4 and 5 year old boys. I usually do not care for the look of Velcro shoes, but needed something my boys would be able to put on themselves. These are ADORABLE!!!! I loooove how they look sleek and not clunky like a lot of sneakers. Based on some reviews and by scouring the web for Pumas shoe measurement chart, I bought a size up and they fit perfectly. If it is helpful, my boys feet were between 16.5 and 17 cm when measured...very professionally by tracing their feet on paper and using my trusty wooden ruler! My onlyyyy reservation about these shoes is that the first thing my husband said when he saw the kids wearing them is &#34;what's with the pink lights?&#34; The outside red stripe lights up and well...honestly it does kind of look pink when it lights up, but my boys haven't noticed. They love them, but I am slightly nervous about sending my 5 year old to kindergarten in them because of the pinkish looking lights. We'll see - if it causes a problem, I plan to wash them in the washing machine a few times to kill the lights and can hopefully continue to enjoy these super cute shoes!!	2015-08-01

Holds a larger cell phone too!	I ordered several different bags from Amazon for a wedding and this was the clear winner.  It's well made - there are no sharp edges on the metal and even thought the strap is a chain, it's soft - no sharpness to it at all.  The clasp on top has a few fake diamonds but it's tasteful.  Just enough to give it a tiny bit of sparkle without being too &#34;out there&#34; or blingy.<br /><br />Now, let's talk about the size.  If you have one of the newer larger cell phones, this bag will work.  Many of the long thin bags won't hold a larger cell phone. So that's a problem and one reason why I came back to this one.  But I wanted a bag that I could also add some lipstick, kleenex and maybe even a tiny camera and there is plenty of room in this one.  It comes in several nice colors.  I ordered the silver. It's not shiny or garish.  Just a nice fabric with a bit of sheen.<br /><br />I also spent some time looking at small evening bags in stores and was not impressed with the selection. Again, many were long and skinny so a larger cell phone wouldn't fit.  I kept coming back to this one and I'm very pleased with it.  And yes, the inside is a GORGEOUS red color. So fun and happy.	2015-08-01

They are lighter weight than any other tennis shoes that I've owned and I feel like I move around the court with them really well.  I play tennis 4-5 times per week on average and they are starting to show some wear on the soles.  But I've been wearing them for 5 months now, so I think I am due a new pair, for certain.<br /><br />My only concern (and reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5) is that my coach at the club thinks they don't provide enough support.  I didn't realize this since they are so comfortable.  I thought I would mention it here in case someone is looking or a very sturdy supportive shoe, these might now be the right fit.  That is probably why they feel lighter than all my other pairs.	2015-08-01

I think it is a shame I have to pay to return shoes that are way too small. I buy many different brands from different companies. I have no problem with my size, DC makes shoes ridiculously small. DC has a  bad return policy, I wanted to return these for a larger size. No way, you have to reorder a new pair at the going price and pay an outrageous price to return the first  pair. I will not buy DC products and I am unhappy with Amazon, they make enough and should make me whole for this purchase. The freight was not a few bucks, it was almost half the price of the shoes. I am very disappointed and will look elsewhere in the future. The buyer should use a size chart reflecting how small these shoes are made and increase the size accordingly.	2015-08-01

No way the mom can make the trip in Bo Bo tennis shoes. I might add also that she has NEVER in her life owned anything better then a pro wings brand or even Wal-Mart el-cheapos for that matter.<br />So being the great son I am I got on Amazon and ordered her up a pair of these bad boys to improve her 40 time. All I heard from the time they were shipped to the time she received them was I didnt have to do that and she didnt need new sneekers. Regardless at 55.96 these black and purple streamlined bad boys were on the way. Now Im not saying the shoes improved her 40 time much but I can assure you she hopped off the plane and was moving with a purpose to the baggage terminal and all she could talk about was how great her new Nike's were and how good they fit. They hardly came off her feet the whole vacation and in the end I am glad she finally got a pair of good sneekers at 67.	2015-08-01

I've had many Jessica Simpson heels and they've all looked good and were pretty comfortable. These are exactly what I expected them to be. My feet are normal width and I wear an 8.5 usually but since I've noticed my other JS heels that were 8.5 started to get a little loose, I went with an 8. As with any shoes that are high, your feet naturally slide downward so &#34;heel slippage&#34; is a concern. They fit snug on my feet and my heel isn't coming out of them when I walk. The width is fine- it holds my feet in but it is tight (not uncomfortably so, just enough to keep you feeling secure in them). What I didn't notice was the seam that runs up the front of the shoe (see photo). I don't really mind this but others may want a more clean looking front. These heels also have a more pronounced point (see photo) than others of mine but I don't mind this either because I love the silhouette it makes from the side. The toe portion sits lower than others I've had so you will probably have some toe cleavage. I think Jessica Simpson heels look and feel great!	2015-08-01

If the straps were attached farther apart at the top, it would probably solve the issue.

They are very comfortable and well constructed. Downside is they don't have much support (sort of expected that) and they lose their shape. I tend to walk on the outer-sides of my feet, so the shoe now looks like I walk on the outer-sides of my feet. My other shoes maintain their shape, but these ones don't. I would excuse the shortcomings if the shoe was $25 or more cheaper. This is a pricey casual shoe - which is just a notch above a slipper - but they are comfy and the seams and bottom hold up well. Bottom line, I bought them for comfort and quick slip-on and they deliver.	2015-08-01

It was extremely cute and comfortable from what I could tell. However as everyone has mentioned, they run large. I'm usually an 8 - 8 1/2 and I went for an 8. Ended up being too big, so I came online to try and reorder the shoe in either a 7 or 7 1/2. To my extreme disappointment all sizes lower than an 8 were $30 MORE! I love the shoes, but what sold me was the $29.99 price and coughing up $30 extra dollars to get a different size, I just couldn't do it. So I sadly boxed up my shoes and will be returning the them, and will not be getting another pair. If you're fine with spending $60 then go for it. You will love how cute they are.	2015-08-01

They are the most comfortable sandal you can find on the market and take it from me cause I am a sandal girl. I hardly EVER wear anything but sandals and I always end up at the end of the day with my Reef's on. It doesn't matter if I start my day with some cute brand new sandals that I just purchased that I absolutely adore, I ALWAYS at some point end up switching out to the Reef's. I carry a pair in my purse at all times just in case.  So while I just can't say enough good things about Reef sandals, these that I ordered are in fact Reef's but they were too small. I usually wear size 6 - 6½ and I ordered size 6 from this seller but they were too small so while I highly recommend these sandals, I also recommend you order a size up. Other than that there were no other issues. You will not be sorry for purchasing these. I love them and I'm almost positive you will too! Shipping was fast. Other than the size being too small, and by the way that is the ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, the product is authentic and what was described by seller.	2015-08-01

Very short handle. Still a nice bag. Big but not too big. Probably wouldn't buy again but it is good for the price. Update after one week the lining of outer pocket is torn and can not be sewn back easily. Returning bag.  Update just got a replacement bag and guess what there is a rip in the same place in a brand new bag only the rip is smaller.  So the quality is very poor.  I can mend this rip because it is smaller and I caught it before it got bigger so I won't return the 2nd bag but the quality of the lining is very poor.	2015-08-01

As others have noted, the insole is not sufficiently glued down. Why the manufacturer doesn't put adequate glue under the insole is puzzling. Shoe seems to work OK after I found some aquarium glue and glued down the insole myself. Anyway, one feature that is better than most other water shoes is the drawstring on the back which keeps the shoe from coming loose in the water.	2015-08-01

They're the kind of big, squishy, comfortable all-purpose athletic shoes with thick cushiony soles that seem to be getting harder to find these days. After developing a case of plantar fasciitis from walking barefoot on tile floors I started wearing these and my heel pain has nearly disappeared. Great for walking and tennis, and look like they'll last a long time. I'll probably go back to Costco for another pair; I wish they came in more colors than just white. Highly recommended.	2015-08-01

I was hoping that they fit as good as they look , but as they say looks can be deceiving . I had bought a  1/2 size larger than I usually wear and the wide version .I tried them on with the normal socks that I wear with these types of boots and first impression was they don't fit. The toe box is too narrow and cramp up our feet  and the vibram soles  just don't feel right but  I wore them around the house to at least give them a chance. I had to take them off in about 30 minutes because my feet hurt. I am disappointed that these boots were so  uncomfortable for me. I am in the process of returning them and will look for something else.	2015-08-01

The egg crate insoles drag on your socks a bit when you slip your foot in, but once on they are wonderfully comfortable. My instep is slightly high and I have no problems with the band across the top of my foot. In fact, there is a small gap between my foot and the band that would accommodate a significantly higher instep.

The sandal takes a little getting used to, at first. The arch is higher than any other sandal I have worn. They have been a pleasure to my feet, after getting used to them. If you need arch support from a pair of sandals, these are the sandals to own. I recommend them highly.	2015-08-01

Even though these are boys shoes I ordered red for my 2 year old daughter. She normally wears a size 6 but I ordered a 6.5 and with a pair of socks on they fit her perfect. She can run in them with no problems of them slipping off. They are ADORABLE! In my opinion, they could be unisex. The sole has such good traction I see why they are called boat shoes...So they won't slip off a boat LOL they seem to be very comfortable because she always picks these shoes out of all her others to wear. They are very well made and feel like they will last a long time (way past her outgrowing them) when they do get too small for her I definitely will order another pair of these.	2015-08-01

Not many people comment on Crocs but we actually got a few comments on how cute they were.  They are so lightweight and are great for pool or beach wear or even to slip on as you run out the door.  They are so easy to slip on and can be worn with the strap around the heel or the strap pushed up to be worn more like a clog.	2015-08-01

I'm just hoping that the manufacturer would look into this, and that is why I gave the rain boots one star. The boot lining colors have printed on my socks with the same pattern- so no doubt it's the boot lining. These are brand new boots: I only wore these boots twice for 45 min max each time this week. hardly any rain on both days (phone weather app not so truthful- and i had to carry them to work!), I was either on a bus or train for most of my trips (no wet anything). and on top of that, my feet don't sweat even during the toughest gym workout. I am very concerned about the pigments coming on to the socks, as it means they run on my legs as i wear shorter athletic socks in the summer- and who knows, they might have but I didn't notice. Is it expected from Le Chameau boot lining?	2015-08-01

Hallelujah!!!! I am buying several more for when this one wears out!!!! I got the teal one, even though the color looks garish online, another reviewer said she liked the color and it really is much better in person than the photo. I am a minimalist, I don't ever have more than one purse, I just prefer function over fashion, but this one fits the bill for both! If only the long zippered compartment on the front was just one inch longer then my week-at-a-glance calendar would fit there, but I'm OK with it being tucked inside. 6 exterior pockets, all zippered or magnetically snapped, one interior zippered pocket and 2 little interior pouches... everything has it's place in this AWESOME purse!

I thought this wallet was adorable and bought it to replace an incredibly durable and long-lasting Fossil wallet that I had been using for years and years. This Hobo wallet was functional for about 1-2 weeks before it started self-unloading all my credit cards and ID any time it was turned upside down, which naturally happens when it's carried on its own, rather than in a purse. The leather on the turquoise version I bought rubbed off within days and now appears so dirty and worn that I am embarrassed to take it out of my purse. I contacted Hobo customer &#34;service&#34; to see if they would replace the wallet with a different style that didn't dump all my cards onto the ground so regularly and they didn't offer any support of any kind. Basically, and I'm paraphrasing here, they  just said, &#34;yeah, we know our products don't last. Nothing we care to do about that. Buy another one.&#34; I have gone back to Fossil and get lots of compliments on that wallet. Long review short: If you need a cute wallet that will last between 2 days and a month, maybe this is for you. If you're looking for style, solid design, and durability, then check out Fossil or Frye.	2015-08-01

The seller was great. The shoes don't fit like a regular Skecher GoWalk 2, in my opinion. They fit a bit larger, probably because there isn't as much over the instep to hold the shoe on the foot, but they are longer, too. I had to go a half size down, which mean that they are a teeny bit snug in the toe box. I also noticed that these don't seem to be as cushiony and springy in the soles as a regular GoWalk 2. But it is a more versatile style, and I still like them for every day.	2015-08-01

I go larping in tabi boots which means I'm usually wearing them for a solid 30 hours. These are definitely the nicest tabi boots I've owned so far. Others have a very flat bottom to them which gives no support to the foot and after a day of walking leaves even a tough foot sore (walking on rocks a lot will expedite the painfulness). I also like the closure system these have over Velcro ones I've used in the past. These consistently stayed closed longer.  All in all this are great ninja shoes. 10/10 would weaboo again.	2015-08-01

But with one drawback. It's so small that you can't put much in it.  For example, one eyeglass case in the topmost (and largest) pocket will crowd out the other pockets.  In fact anything you put in it will make some of the pockets unusable.  Also the two tiny pockets at the bottom of the front won't contain even a single car key.  On the positive side, here's what I've found it especially useful for: 1) Shopping in cases where you're going to be carrying heavy things (like groceries), want hands free, and don't want additional weight hanging on your arm.  This bag easily holds the same items that in colder weather, I would carry in jacket pockets to the same end.  2)  Slipping into carry-on luggage on an airplane for use at your destination.  Ideal for that.  3) Stuffing into a desk drawer that's already &#34;full.&#34;<br /><br />I wish some company would also make larger bags out of lightweight leather.  Who wants to drag around something that weighs 2 to 4 pounds without anything in it with the manufacturer's excuse that all genuine leather is heavy?	2015-08-01

The inside insole is lightly patterned, so they weren't as comfortable for wearing all day the first few times that I wore them, although the fit of the shoe was fine ... which is why I docked a star.  I still notice the pattern, but it doesn't irritate me after several hours or wear now.  I'm not quite sure why the pattern inside is needed.<br /><br />I've had a couple of comments on how cute they are.  The downside of the velcro ankle strap is that it seems to get tangled with several items of clothing or knitting, e.g. in the locker in the gym.  I have other clothes velcro straps and they don't seem to have the same problem.	2015-08-01

I wear many heels that don't hurt, but found that with a normal day of working and walking in an office job that I could not wait to get home and get these off of my feet by the end of the day because they rubbed. I expect more from Clarks. If they had given a little more leather at that part of the shoe there would be no issue. I will wear them occasionally but they won't be a first choice in my wardrobe.	2015-08-01

I purchased this wallet with framed coin pocket a few years ago and have been using it hard ever since. It is most definitely a woman's wallet, meant for a purse, not a back pocket.  It works with American money, euros, or a combination. It is as tough as nails and since it is a tri-fold it doesn't take up a lot of space in your purse. The framed coin purse is extremely practical for dumping coins in without having them fall  back out. There are two compartments for bills, so you can keep paper money from different countries separate, or just keep your large currency separate from your small currency. The wallet has seen heavy use and still looks like new. I plan on buying two this Christmas for female relatives. Why anyone would think this was a men's wallet is beyond me. Too bad for the men, this works great!	2015-08-01

These boots were purchased for me about a month ago and I've worn them a total of three times. Twice around the office to wear them in and once for a hike up Mt. Katahdin to really test them out. Total mileage of about 15 miles. While they were very comfortable and looked great, I noticed that there was a hole on the right boot's toe box where the stitching had come apart after the hike. It's right where the rubber meets the fabric where the toes bend. I contacted Salomon customer support and was notified that &#34;the damage was the result of normal wear and tear.&#34; So they're telling me that my $170 &#34;fully waterproof hiking sneaker&#34; is rendered no longer waterproof after one hike up to Baxter Peak. Buyer beware. This seems to be a common issue with this particular boot.	2015-08-01

If they feel snug at first, I would wear them around for a while. They souls are cushy. Little to no arch support. The one issue is that the bottoms do not grip well on smooth surfaces and they're a bit hazardous when encountering moisture on a smooth surface.	2015-08-01

The soles do wear out really quickly and I guess thats a way to keep you buying more, but other than that, they are comfortable,  They don't breathe very well. If they had a Vibram sole they would be better,  For the price they are good.  I have thought about trying to get some resoled since the leather outlasts the sole.	2015-08-01

Excellent boots except while the cuff measurement does flare out to almost as listed, it is only due to a tiny elastic triangle at the top.

Appropiate with slacks but dead ugly with shorts or a skirt.  Until now the recommeded &#34;cute&#34; shoes I could wear were Mary Janes.  The orthodic friendly Mary Janes I could wear  would be very appropiate to wear to a Goth event.  Fine if you are young.  But at  62 I am way past Mary Janes.<br />These sandals are not only stylish but so comfortable.  I have trouble with my knees so I was very pleased with their fantastic shock absorption.

I was looking for a neutral colored shoe that added a little fun to a basic outfit. they are real leather with a very slight metallic tinge.

I most frequently use this bag for commuting. In the black color, it's elegant enough for professional work attire (and much lighter and tougher than leather), and the beige interior makes it easy to find everything inside. This is a medium style tote that fits my (larger size) iPad, a water bottle, sweater/jacket, and a few sundries. The best thing about it is that the iPad fits in a padded zipper pocket (behind the main external pocket), and then your phone, wallet, keys can go in the secure, but easy accessible main outside pocket (magnetic button closure).  I haven't yet tried to attach this bag to a roller bag or carry-on luggage (using the back-pocket zipper feature). If I am carrying my laptop or a bunch of stuff I use the Avenue tote instead.	2015-08-01

I had eyed these boots for awhile and when they went on sale I couldn't resist. In fact I ended buying them in both dark brown and cognac. The cognac is absolutely gorgeous. They are made with an amazingly soft pebbled leather.. The foot bed and toe box were a bit snug but quickly conformed to the shape of my foot. The cushioning in the sole is almost as good as what you would expect from a pair of sneakers. The boot height comes up just past the top of my knee cap. The partial side zip makes for easy on and off. The shaft width is perfect for tucking in skinny jeans which come fall should be my standard way of wearing them.	2015-08-01

When my eye doctor tested my vision and said I was almost blind when driving at sunset or at night, I thought my days of driving after dark were gone and that I would have to be dependent upon others to haul me around.  Then I started seeing articles for &#34;Night Vision Glasses&#34;, I did a lot of research, and finally found the &#34;Yellow Sunglasses for Night Driving&#34; by proSPORT.<br /><br />To say they have been a welcome addition to my driving &#34;tools&#34; would be an understatement!  I have early cataracts, so if I drive at night, the headlights coming at me are like bright stars in the sky and I can't judge where I am on the road, plus the lights are very distracting.  When I use the glasses, it's like the difference between night and day!  I can see exceptionally well and now drive with more confidence.<br /><br />They aren't perfect and don't promise to be but, for me, they work as well as I need them to, which means putting them on shortly before sunset.  I also love using them when it's overcast, as it brightens my field of vision wonderfully well.  They don't cut down the glare from the oncoming headlights all the way, but enough so that I can put up with a few &#34;stars&#34; until I can get home safely.<br /><br />The glasses themselves are well-constructed and fit firmly on my face.  They can be easily cleaned with a soft cloth and they come with a soft carrying case.  They fit my needs well and I highly recommend them!	2015-08-01

Smaller than I anticipated but its very beautiful in person, I love the color. I saw the description says 9 inches but I pictured a slightly larger bag. If you do get it be prepared to maybe fit a small e-reader (or apple ipad mini) keys, lipstick, and or a wallet. It has compartments so your things are not swimming together in one big section, so you can separate makeup, from keys and money, and phone. There is three sections. A pouch like section in the middle with a zipper and two more spaces on each side. I like that it comes with a storage bag shaped like a strawberry so when you unfold it it turns to a storage tote, when you take your purse out you can roll the back into the strawberry.

I wear several styles for various occasions.  This particular style does not disappoint!  I needed a lower heel/still stylish shoe and I generally have difficulties since I have narrow feet and require the arch support as well.  The ranges in options for size/width are accurate for me; the shoes are truly a 'best fit' (my feet thank me daily!)  and these shoes were delivered so promptly!  Probably the only regret I have:  I ordered one pair of these slip-ons and another pair of Eastland shoes one week before the fabulous sale so I really wish I had waited the one week to obtain better savings.	2015-08-01

They're lightweight and comfortable, and I got them in the turquoise color, which is very pretty. I like them enough that I'm strongly considering buying a second pair in fuchsia.<br /><br />My only concern is that the sole has two layers, and I can already see enough erosion on the thin, rubbery bottom layer that I'm sure it will start wearing through in another month or two. They don't seem like they'll last even half as long as Danskos, some of which I've worn for almost a decade without any fatal damage to the soles.	2015-08-01

I have purchased J Renee shoes in both regular and wide without any problems.  These shoes I bought 8 1/2 W and was really surprised at how tight they felt for a wide and how short they were. I had to check the box and shoe to make sure it was an 8 1/2 W. I returned them for a 9W.  That is why I am giving it 4 stars, for the fit but 5 stars for the color and versatility!.  Other than the size being a bit off for me, the shoes are really cute and the colors will go with not only black or dark blue dress pants, but I have some teal, light blue, and fuchsia dress pants that really picks up the colors in the shoes. I did not wear these other than trying them on, well I did walk around my place with them on. However, with the right fit they will be very comfortable, the heel felt very stable. I am used to wearing high heels, so I did not feel that these were too high. So I would recommend these shoes, but to go up half a size whether you go wide or not.	2015-08-01

These are ah-mazing! Super comfortable to wear and they have a little extra padding for the ball of your foot which makes standing more comfortable. They run true to size and width. With the wider opening at the top I thought my heel might slide but adding socks was all it took to fix that. I was worried that with the cutouts you'd be able to tell if I was wearing socks with these but you can't tell at all. The heel is the perfect height for wearing all day, not too high but still definitely a heel. The sole on the heel is plastic so I'll have to remember to be careful on slippery floors since I'm a klutz :) Made of good suede material and well constructed. I'd recommend treating these with a water repellent spray so they'll last longer when wearing them in fall and winter. The photo of the mink color is a little darker than the actual boot; they're more of a taupe. Very neutral and will go with just about everything in my closet! Great investment and I highly recommend!!	2015-08-01

The wingtip style with a Doc-type sole (but MUCH lighter weight) gives it a distinctive look.  The leather is relatively thin (but not cheap) and the shaft is nice and soft, so no chafing.  The boot runs about 1/4 size large, so there's room for a good cool-weather sock, or for your foot to swell a little on warm days or when you're on your feet for hours.  I have a narrow foot and the boot fit me well in my regular size.  And speaking of size--on one website, a European 40 equalled a 9, on another a 9.5 (for this shoe).  I wear a 9 in most shoes, and, as I mentioned, this seems to be about a 9 1/4.  Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />The boot has a full, knit lining and a lightly padded tongue.  Appearances to the contrary, the midsole & sole do not have much give, but the boot seems pretty comfortable.  I often wear an arch support orthotic, but I'd need a bigger size boot to fit it, and they seem to top out at 40, so oh, well.  And speaking of arches--the side zipper is useful for getting the boot off, but my high arches mean I have to unlace it to get it back on.  Oh, these first-world problems!<br /><br />A previous reviewer said that they toe of the boot looks bowl-like, but that's not my experience at all.  It's tapered and much more refined than a work boot/Doc Marten equivalent.  The wingtip is pretty subtle, but you can see it, so you get the best of both worlds with plenty of space for your toes, both side-to-side and top to insole.  (To contrast, I had to buy my BedStu Bonnie boots 1/2 size larger because the top of the shoe pressed down on both big toes like an anvil.)<br /><br />All in all, the only negatives I have for these boots are the lack of cush in the insole and the thinness of the leather overall--I would have liked a little more substantial boot, frankly.  I think the BedStus will be around forever, but I'm not sure how long these will last.	2015-08-01

No need to break them in, felt comfortable since day one and actually have pretty great arch support for heels.

The color is rich, and the fit is true-to-size. I wear a 7.5M shoe in almost all styles of shoe, and this fits perfectly in a 7.5. I especially like that the strap across the front of the foot is thick, tubular, padded suede. It is soft and rests comfortably across the top and sides of the foot. I have wanted a pair of sandals in this style for a while, but wasn't willing to deal with a thin leather strap cutting into the top of my foot or teetering around with little to no support across my foot or around my ankle...which brings me to the ankle strap and closure: I like that this shoe has a rear zip closure so I don't have to fuss with a pin and buckle closure. The strap that goes around the ankle is well-padded and comfortable with a bit of elastic goring in the inner side to allow for stretch, movement, and comfort. I anticipate being able to wear this shoe comfortably for at least a few hours at a time.	2015-08-01

I bought these shoes because I tried them on at Kohls, but they didn't have my size in the store. The ordering process was quick and easy. I received my shoes in great condition. When I tried them on, they were a bit small. These shoes are very comfortable witht the memory foam inside. I love memory foam in shoes, it is a great idea, keeps my feet nice and comfy all day long. The more I've been wearing my shoes, the better they are fitting, just took some getting used to, but they are good now. I recommend these to anyone who wants a comfortable shoe.

Will be returning.	I usually wear an 8W, ordered a Rockport along with this shoe, both in the same size, and this shoe was a bit bigger. It was a tad bit longer, so the main problem I had was that my heel was slipping when walking. Also, there was considerable damage to the inside side of the right shoe, like something had crushed and wrinkled it or something. Unfortunately, they don't carry a 7.5W so I will be going with a different shoe. I think it would be totally fine a half size down, for me. Disappointing.	2015-08-01

There were small dents all over the sides of the box, additionally  it had a distinct manufacture odor that was very strong. I had to air it out for a few days.to get rid of it. Finally like all shoes these wedge heels were uncomfortable at first, I wouldn't recommend wearing it for long periods of time as they tend to pinch the sides of your feet but once you break them in I don't think they're very bad. I particularly like the suede material, the shoes are darker than the pictures and of course they are super cute and fashionable.

It was my first pair in that brand. They had that &#34;golf-ball in my shoe&#34; arch feeling from the moment I put them on. I don't need that kind of arch support and after an hour in them (just walking around the house), I was in agony. I was prepared to return them to Amazon, but I remembered that my neighbor had mentioned his arch/custom insole issues several times. A few days later I took them over and explained why I was returning them and asked him to see if they fit him and if the &#34;golf-ball&#34; was helpful in his case. He came over the next evening and went on and on about how great they were. He asked if he could buy the ones I had and where could he get more of that same brand. I sent him the link and two weeks later he told me he had bought three more pairs in various styles and what a fantastic find they were. He said they are the first ones he's owned in years that he could wear without his custom orthopedic inserts. So I gather all the Chaco brand styles must have that same arch support characteristic as well. I thought this insight might be helpful for others with similar arch support needs-- and that sharing my experience would serve some purpose. Again-- I know very little about the brand and there may be something critical that I'm unaware of; so please do some research before you buy anything. I just know that Ted next door was almost in tears over how great they were for his orthopedic issues and I felt obliged to share it in case it's useful to anyone with similar issues. Best Of Luck!	2015-08-01

The pictures are accurate, but I have to wonder if the written description is for another bag.  It is NOT alligator embossed leather.  Just regular pebbled leather texture finish.  The described dimensions of 14&#34; wide and 12&#34; tall are not accurate either.  The actual bag is much smaller than that at approximately 11-1/2&#34; wide and 9&#34; tall.  From the description I was expecting a larger bag and really would like it better if it was larger.  It would likely be fine for many ladies, but I tend to carry extra &#34;stuff&#34;.  The firearm pouch is just fine.  Holster is secured by velcro and holds the gun in place well.  The snubby revolver I carry fits with room to spare and the zippers are plenty adequate for drawing it easily.  Quality of the leather is good and it appears to be well-made.  My only issue is with the overall size.  Too bad they don't make it in a larger size.  I carried it for a day or two to see how it would work, but it's just too small for my needs, so returned it and will look for something just a bit larger.	2015-08-01

I have an &#34;aristocratic foot&#34; - size 10 SS, pointy, and flat footed to boot. It's very hard - almost impossible - to find shoes long and narrow enough for my foot, and his shoe actually fits well - finally, I have the correct size. And it is the soft leather that I require for my tender tootsies.<br />BUT...<br />even though the leather is soft, the edges of the woven strips rub against the tops of my toes!  Owiee. So I have to take the shoes off. I don't get it, really, since it feels smooth and soft to my fingers when I feel inside.<br />Hopefully, the rubbing will stop after a few more wears. It is a lovely shoe!  If that part gets better with wear, I will up my rating.	2015-08-01

As a big fan of the barefoot mode of footwear I was looking for someth8ing that looked a little mo0re traditional but with the same feel of being barefoot. No these don't provide support of any kind. The point is to strengthen the muscles of the foot so it can function correctly. Wearing this style of shoe has really helped with my knees which used to get very painful in shoes with padding and support. At first my feet did get tired and sore but that passed as the muscles got stronger.<br /><br />My only issue with these shoes is that they are not water resistant at all and I work in an environment that can be wet at times so I can no longer wear them to work. I usually wear these without socks just in day to day casual wear. They can easily go into the washer to be cleaned.	2015-08-01

None the less, my daughter went to the water park with her water skin shoes with reminders to walk properly ie) not to drag her feet or to rub the bottom of her foot if bored while waiting in line. She has just returned from the water park, the sole of the water shoe held up although it did get a bit hot on the asphalt.

W/o a doubt, THE most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Yes they are expensive, but with feet like mine, (wide toebox, narrow heel, surgery on metatarsals, arthritis etc etc) I cannot afford to buy ill fitting shoes. Its a waste of money. I took a gamble and was happily surprised! The only issue I have, and its cuz at my current weight my feet are wide, is the arch support area is coming apart by being stretched out. I will wait till my weight reduces to wear them in the Fall (had bypass surgery) and if it doesn't improve will contact the company. Very happy with the purchase - they look great and are so comfy as well! I bought the black with red accents and get many compliments. Definitely recommend!	2015-08-01

Maybe they just don't fit my foot right, but the very high arch support is too far forward for me, which makes them uncomfortable.  Another person might not have this problem.  They have a suade (?) inner lining which is very warm on the foot - so not good for summer wear.  They are also look like Clarks - the wide ones, which isn't a look I like.  In the picture I couldn't tell they looked this way.  So these are not a great shoe for me, but could be perfect for someone else.  They are well made.	2015-08-01

I've had trouble with runners knee in the past, and so far no indications of reoccurrence with the 17's. I'm 11.5D, and the fit is as expected. As of right now I would definitely buy again. I've had many Asics models over the years, and they keep getting better.	2015-08-01

These give him great stability when climbing on the jungle gym or over rocks.	2015-08-01

First shoe I put on and never felt the need to &#34;break in&#34;. They were comfortable off the bat. I've worn Clarks flip flops and have sworn by them since I was about 15 years old. The flip flops hold up beautifully and look almost new even after 6 years and counting of use year round even when around the house. Only wear shown is where the bottom molds to your heel and foot slightly so there is a formed bottom of the sandal bed. I decided to splurge and get their tennis shoes and I'm very happy I did. I've been getting Dr.Scholls gel heel tennis shoes every year for the past 4 years because I wore them out with work and everyday use, but wanted something that would last longer. I no longer have to wear white tennis shoes for work, so I was happy to be able to find a very high quality navy shoe. I'm pleased with this shoe's performance. I tested them a few days in a row putting them on in the morning and not taking them off till around bedtime just to see how comfortable and I was happy with the results! They are very comfortable and I also noticed my feet don't get very sweaty like in other shoes. They seem a little heavier when you hold them, but when you put them on they're soft to walk on but very durable.	2015-08-01

My toes hung over the ends, but one trip around my living room in them convinced me that I HAD TO HAVE THEM in the right size and would pay any price for them, including $280 (holy cow).  So I returned the 8s, and the 9s came a couple days ago. Usually a 9 is too big on my narrowish foot, but with the back strap being adjustable, I was able to make these a perfect fit.  Besides the good looks, great fit, and feeling like I'm walking around on puffs of whipped cream in them, I am thrilled with the stability of these sandals.  I have weak ankles and have fallen and broken bones twice in the last six months due to that.  My orthopedic surgeon told me no more backless shoes, no more Crocs (WAH!), no more soles and/or heels with rounded sides--they have to come straight down so if my ankle buckles, the shoe will stay flat on the ground and not let me fall.  Mission accomplished.  Too bad the butternut color isn't available in a 9.  I'd snap it up in a heartbeat, even at $280.	2015-08-01

I have gotten tons of compliments on them! I am not someone who wears high heels often and I live in a big city where I have to walk quite a bit each day but I'm able to wear these shoes all day at work and walk to and from in them. The only thing I didn't like is BE AWARE if you live in Canada, you will pay for customs when they arrive. The shoes are expensive and the shipping cost to Canada was quite expensive and there was no mention of further customs charges so I assumed they were included in the shipping cost but NO, when I received the shoes I had to pay another $40. I hate unexpected costs like that and wish companies were more transparent. That being said, the shoes are worth the splurge.	2015-08-01

Unlike much of Frye's antiqued leather, these don't look like they are already worn out. They are a rich cognac with amazing highlights. They have a nice slim leg style with adjustable buckles for those with a wider leg. The toe box is nice and rounded with plenty of room. The foot bed is nicely padded with reasonable arch support. The boot height is such that it comes to just below my knee (I'm 5&#34;11&#34; tall). Normally I don't wear heels but these boots were too hard to resist. Even with the heels I can wear them all day. As they are a slim boot, they work great with straight leg and boot cut jeans. They are not however too slim so you can still wear them with skinny jeans tucked in. For those of you who wear skirts, they should be great as well.	2015-08-01

I would just suggest changing the picture advertised to one of the other navy blue options because they look like that not the light blue that was depicted in the ones I chose.

The sole of the shoe is very thin	I used them once for rafting, and the insole (which was supposedly glued in) came off and began sliding around inside the shoe, causing sand and grit to get under the sole and rub against my feet for the duration of the trip.<br /><br />They are also not comfortable.  The sole of the shoe is very thin, so if you're walking on a rocky area, prepare for pain.  I had to wear these as we walked through the woods for a short time, and I could feel every single rock poking against my feet.<br /><br />The mesh also allows sand to get in and rub against your feet.  I don't imagine a lot of people would like that, either.<br /><br />However, they are cheap.  If you need some semi-disposable water shoes you'll only wear once, you might want to consider these.  They went in the dumpster after I got into my dry clothes, because, obviously, I couldn't return shoes that had been worn in the river.	2015-08-01

I feel like these were marked a wrong size, because they were HUGE.  There's always a variation in the size of Dansko--they're hand made, but I have never had them run a full size or more too large.  I've owned these previously and loved them.  The pair that fit, I wore for about 4 years, and finally gave them up when the sole split.  Have worn Dansko for 15 years and wear them every day (as a RN) in a variety of clinical settings.  Very comfortable, amazing arch support, and excellent foot bed.  If you're a first time Dansko purchaser, please be aware that you MUST get your feet accustomed to these shoes.  Only wear them for an hour or two at the time, otherwise you will hate them.	2015-08-01

They met my criteria perfectly. They fit my wide feet & don't look huge as the photo implies. I was surprised these came from China as I had the product within 10 days of ordering. I typically avoid all products made in China, but these were beyond what I've been long seeking. They are Vegan, which is a must for me. Cute, but casual which fits my workplace & the summer dresses I love. They also have comfortable thick soles, which I need for frequent painful foot issues, yet are flattering. The fringe is removable & these shoes turn into perfect Mary Janes! They look cute either way and are also sturdy shoes . Extremely happy!! I will purchase in the other colors!!	2015-08-01

I decided to try them on anyway and I LOVE THIS SHOE	I was upset when I opened the box and saw that the 'red' shoe is really more 'orange' but I decided to try them on anyway and I LOVE THIS SHOE! The bed of the shoe has a surprisingly comfortable cushion and the fabric is soft on the skin. The 1/2 inch platform helps takes the pressure off the bed of the foot making it more comfortable to walk in a 3.5 inch skinny heel. Last but definitely not least, the shoe looks really sexy on my foot. I am keeping this shoe (although it is orange and not red) AND I have purchased a blue pair and a black pair.	2015-08-01

I got them a week before I planned to use them hiking Rainbow Falls to LeConte and Bullhead trails. I used them for trail running a couple of times to loosen them up, based on other reviews stating that they start out fitting a bit snugly but fit properly after use. The reviews were spot on. They loosened up and felt great on my second trail run of 4 miles. They have excellent traction in mud, dirt, rocky terrain, and wet terrain. They held up fantastically on the 2 toughest trails in the Smoky Mountains (not counting the AT) with a 30 lb pack on my back. I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone looking at strictly trail running or for both hiking and trail running!	2015-08-01

I wish I had ordered up; it was a little narrow so the fit was a little tighter than snug. There was also no arch support, so I should have gone for an even bigger size *(maybe 7.5) and added arch support. The boots were also surprisingly taller than expected. I'm a short girl (5'2&#34;) and this hit me at the middle of my knee, which just looked weird. The calf was also pretty wide. I have pretty normal calves and they were just a little too roomy for my tastes. Had to return, which is a shame because the materials and craftmanship of the boot are really nice.	2015-08-01

I ordered about 10 things in preparation for vacation and this purse was the only item I was somewhat disappointed with.  Not *terrible* disappointed...I'll use it...but the canvas material is not as bright as I thought it would be.  Has 2 great outside pockets for phone and keys (sturdy pockets, and one's nice and deep), and it's roomy enough inside. Thick straps for shoulder carrying is nice, too. Kiss Gold has a lot of bags, and next time I'd ordered a different style.  Allow time for this order.  I THINK it comes from overseas. I asked them to hurry it up if they could (their email is on Amazon's site), and they did get here sooner than I thought, but normally I think it takes about 3 weeks, fyi.	2015-08-01

The ones I tried on were 8's although I wear an 8.5. I decided to order one of each size just in case. The 8's were way too small and the 8.5 were also short, however my heel slipped wearing them. I would need a 9- a half size up--if I were &#34;normal,&#34; however my heels is narrow so this slipping is sort of a repeated crime for me-- I have a hard time finding booties or short boots for this reason.<br />Secondly, this is just my opinion-- although the color was the same as the photo: &#34;dolphin gray&#34; personally, I think the gray is a smudge too light in tone for typical fall winter clothes. Grays are difficult anyway since some wardrobe items can be nearly putty. Anyway, I didn't have a great feeling about the color when I ordered them so I should've maybe just held back. Oh well,back they go!	2015-08-01

The Phillip Tall Harness is my favorite tall boot I've found. I got a pair in black about three years ago and have worn them at a number of conventions where I have to walk all day. While I do always use at least a small foam insert, they are one of my more comfortable boots for cons. The only shoes I have that work better are ones that are specifically designed for comfort like my Birkenstock sandals or Clark ankle boots.<br /><br />I actually recently got this boot in burnt red too when it went on sale. If you always have trouble with boots being too big, especially in the ankle, give these a try! I bought my normal size and could fit a thin insert in, but if you want to do a thicker insert or heavy socks, maybe try a half-size bigger.	2015-08-01

My first pair of this style of shoe. I am a convert to minimalist shoes and these certainly fit the bill. Yes, they have a strong chemical odor, which I am sensitive to. I was satisfied that it was acceptable after I aired them in the sun for two days. I still make sure they are shut up in the closet when I'm not wearing them.<br /><br />I needed to make two adjustments for fit: first, I poked additional holes in the strap with an awl so that I could make them fit more securely. Second, I added the cheapest type of drugstore insoles for a little bit of additional padding. They are much more comfortable for me with that little extra cushioning (without it they essentially have none). No arch support or other support, which is what I want. Will buy more!!	2015-08-01

I think they're as pretty as snow boots can be. They are 'chunky' looking, but they're to keep your feet warm, not to make a fashion statement.<br />They are a good bit slimmer than my last pair believe it or not.<br />I usually wear a 6.5 but was going to order a 7 to be safe, by the time I went to check out the last pair of 7's were sold, so I went with the 6.5.<br /><br />They fit perfectly for me. I won't be able to wear a heavy weight sock in them, but I usually only wear light weight to medium in a good pair of boots, so it isn't a problem for me.<br />I would advise ordering up half a size if you want to wear heavy weight otherwise you'll probably be uncomfortable in the toe box.<br /> The thinsulate lining is well constructed with the shoe, and the fleece at the top opening is a nice touch.<br />They are a little stiff to get on and off, but they are lace ups, if you don't tighten them properly you won't get the right fit, so you must loosen them to get them off.<br />I suspect this will ease with time as they get broken in too.<br /><br />I do like the toe box fit, and the fact that they snug to my ankle so well.<br />They also attach nicely to my snow shoes. So I think they will be a good combination together.<br /><br />Being the avid tester I am, I wore them through the dew this morning and was pleased to see the water roll off.<br />They seem like they will hold up to their water proof claims and I have high hopes for how they will fair in the New England winter this year!	2015-08-01

My husbands back has always bothered him, and there was no way he thought these would make a difference, but they truly have.  As long as he is moving, he is fine, but just standing has always bothered him.  After getting these, we went to an amusement park with really long lines, which is usually really rough for him, and he wasn't at all bothered all day.  Since getting these he has had no back pain, amazing.... A way better deal than chiropractors and massages	2015-08-01

We liked these casual shoes--the design is pretty, with a whimsical style. The shoes are constructed with mostly light, pastel colors. The uppers' design is of old-fashioned newspaper advertisements, but of course, in color. Our shoes had advertisements for film processing, as well as refreshments.<br /><br />The sole is a bright yellow design of tree branches and roots!  I didn't notice that at first.  Imaginative!  In fact, the whole shoe is very colorful--I would call this a \\\"happy\\\\\" design.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these shoes aren't really for running or exercise--just fun shoes to wear around the house or perhaps shopping. Nevertheless, the cushioning and sole is thicker than I thought at first, giving more support than I realized.<br /><br />The size ordered (10) fit as expected.<br /><br />As shown in the video, the set also includes a class-looking carry bag.<br /><br />Sample product for impartial review."	2015-08-01

As a Timber Cruiser I work them very hard and they used to be up to the task, however the last two pair have had stitching issues, both on the out soles and upper boot. When they first moved their production from China I got a solid two years from a pair of boots and this boot held up better than Danner's, but no more, Danner's have stitching issues as well and I get one full season from either, with weekly maintenance always the norm, daily during the rare wet weather here.  I hope Georgia pays attention to reviews and does a little better job of QC.

I just got these boots today and I've been wearing them all day and I am so far pleased. So far they seem very easy to break in and I haven't felt any discomfort from breaking em in. And they're comfortable to drive in. That may sound weird but anyone who has to drive a patrol vehicle for upwards of 12 hours a day will appreciate that. I know I do. They are not gore-tex. they're &#34;bates waterproof&#34;. Also the fact that these can be re-soled is much appreciated since that adds years to the boots life. I don't know if their as good as the danner acadias but I do know that they're half the price and my agency wasn't going to spend $300 on boots so if your in that boat or just don't wanna spend that much these are a good alternative so far.

A quality sandal with an insole that is kind to my skin! The design is safe to wear, thanks to the strap over the ankle -- I don't twist my foot or step down wrong with them, like I sometimes do with a flip-flop or wedge style. They are safe to trot in, when I'm jogging, say, to get out of the rain.  The  straps are a pretty style-- fine to wear around town.  The best thing about them is how well they support my feet for walking on pavement or on sandy paths.  I like to use them on my daily 2-mile walks in summertime -- no blistering.	2015-08-01

Like others have commented, the nominal size was too large. I am a size 7.5 and I typically wear 38 Narrow in Danskos, but I couldn't even take a step without stepping out of these size 38 clogs. The size 37's are a little snug (slight heel catch, and a little tight across the middle of the foot), but I'm going to give them a chance and try to break them in. They have seemingly excellent arch support, and they are significantly more attractive than the classic clogs. They look great with skinny jeans and narrow capris!	2015-08-01

The braid is cute and a little more feminine than the plain strap rainbows. The colour is nice, a little darker than I expected but I think that it will hide dirt better than the lighter pair I owned previously. Unfortunately I fall directly between two sizes so they are a tad large for me but it isn't particular noticeable when walking so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />The only negative is that they do require some &#34;breaking in&#34; time. The leather is stiff for a while and so the straps rub the tops of my feet. I have gotten some small blisters while breaking them in but after a week or so they should stretch a little and get much softer. Once this happens I found them incredibly comfortable. I wore my last pair (which were the same braided style in a different colour) almost every day for 2-3 years before they wore out so hopefully these will hold up as well.	2015-08-01

I usually wear and orthotic insert in my shoes and for some reason the shoes that I have been buying even though they are Dr Scholls I have left my feet in much pain. I am standing for probably around 14 hours a day if not more and I put these shoes on and had one of the longest days I've had in awhile at 17 hours and my feet felt wonderful even without the inserts! I have now been wearing them for a week and though they are really not made for the kitchen because they do not have slip resistant soles they are one of the most comfortable shoes I have one in a long time! I have not worked out or run in the shoes I have not use them for sports but I think standing without stress maths on a concrete floor for 14 plus hours is a pretty good indication that if my feet do not hurt and neither does my back you're my thighs or cat as it these shoes are probably one of the better shoes on the market for the price you cannot go wrong!	2015-08-01

YOU'LL LIKE THEM and THEY'LL SAVE YOUR EYES	I own and use 2 pairs of these: one in my &#34;man bag&#34; and one in my pick-up truck.  I do not go out in the sun without them. They definately protect my eyes and clip over may glasses well. If you are a slave to fashion and don't care much about really protecting your eyes... you may care more when you become a senior citizen! Protect your eyes now to enjoy for the rest of your life! :-)<br /><br />When you put on Eagle Eyes the first time and every time you wear them is vision that sees much more detail and every image in more sharp detail: the glare reduction allows you to see much more detail of clouds, buildings, traffic situations, wildlife,  ... everything, without the reduction in light that you'll get from the grey/green sunglasses.<br /><br />You will be stunned by your increased abliity to see much more detail with Eagle Eye blue-blockers Put them on, and give yourself time to adjust to the bronze tint, and give your eyes a few minutes to try them out!<br /><br />Eagle Eyes are great in low light situations, or in broken light situations. With grey/green you will not get as much light and you just won't see as much. In fast changing broken light situations, or in low-light situations you will be able to see more with the blue-blockers. However, if you are driving thru a tunnel, I recommend removing your sunglasses regardless of whether they are blue-blockers or not.<br /><br />The glare redution from these glasses allow your eyes to relax and enjoy the day. I'd advise wearing a hat to protect your head with a broad visor to cut glare even more. Try Sunday Afternoon wide brim hat. The wide brim will cut the glare even more, and you'll protect your eys, head, face and neck from harmful solar radiation.<br /><br />Eagle Eye sunglasses come in a very nice bag that and a very nice semi-hard case with a zipper to help you protect your sunglasses when you are not using them. Eagle Eyes has a cleaning kit available, also, with an anti-fog/cleaner spray.	2015-08-01

They are very comfortable plus, they stretch so they actually fit over my very high arch.  The support is good and they are nice enough to wear to work and tough enough to wear on weekend outings. By far the best sandal I've ever had.  I am hard to fit and hard to please.  I don't buy shoes if they aren't comfortable and have no support. I don't wear heels or flip flops for those reasons. But these don't cause foot issues. Everyone at my office has asked where I got them. I can't wait to try other types of Keen shoes. You won't regret purchasing these sandals.<br /><br />As for color, I was surprised that the top is purple. I thought, from the online photo that it would be gray or very light blue.

She has a wide foot but these fit her comfortably. Some of the princess style sneakers I've purchased have ran small, and even though she can wear an 8 in some older Sesame Street Stride Rites, the 8.5 fits her well. The only con might be that she has a little difficulty putting these on unassisted and it can lead to threenager angst. The tongue is a little stiff and both velcro fasteners have to be opened for her to easily slip her foot in. The lights are flashy without being super bright and she loves that they light up. The sequins give great sparkle too. Great shoes for a little Frozen or Disney Princess fan.	2015-08-01

They were too snug until I replaced the inner removable footbed with a much thinner one. They now felt very comfortable, and had great traction on hikes. Unfortunately, the mesh over the toe area recently started to develop holes. I tried stitching them, but more holes appeared; very annoying since everything else was still in great condition. I have a difficult time finding shoes that fit, so with much hesitation, because I thought the same thing would happen again, I ordered another pair, this time in a 6W. This pair fits fine with the footbed that came with it. Time will tell how well the upper mesh holds up.  Update: After just 3 walk/hikes, holes in the mesh area over the toes began to appear. AAARRGH!! Fortunately, I was still within Amazon's 30 day return/refund window. I was especially annoyed as I was in the middle of a hiking vacation in Acadia National Park. I have great difficulty finding comfortable shoes in my size and so felt doomed to carry on with these holey ones for the duration of the vacation. But alas, the stars aligned. While waiting in line for the ladies' room, I noticed the hiking shoes the lady in front of my was wearing. They had rounded toes and looked like the shape that tends to fit me. She told me they were Merrell's Moab; I figured I would look for them when I returned from vacation, but there they were in my size in a little store in the little town where we were staying. I got them in 6B (they do not come in wide), and they were comfortable right away. Hallelujah. So, if you have somewhat wide feet like mine, I would recommend that you give the Moab a try - Amazon has them.	2015-08-01

I'm not a runner, but a few years ago my arch hurt, so I changed my everyday sneakers to running shoes. I do bike and use an elliptical trainer in them and sometimes play basketball. I wore Asics 2160s at first and liked them and they had a nice wide 4E that fit my wide foot. Every year though, Asics changed the shoe in some way and I had to find the new model that I liked best. They changed so many times, I didn't even like the shoe anymore. I had to find another brand and shoe. I spent a lot of time at a running store with multiple brands and sizes and settled on the 940V2 in a 2E. These shoes seem to be the approximate width of the Asics 4E and are super comfortable. They fit my needs perfectly and I like how they look. One side benefit...I have had hard bumps/callouses on the instep of my right big toe for a long time. I had given up on getting rid of them. In the shower a few days ago, I noticed a marked improvement and I had not even done any treatments recently. I immediately used my file to file it down and then sand it and it is almost 100%. New Balance, please don't change this shoe!	2015-08-01

Sandals are smaller than expected and were not good, which is really a shame because they are so cute and seem so comfortable that really wanted to use.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that I lost that money because I'm from Venezuela and make the return or change is almost impossible due to the lack of companies that provide this service, and those that do come really very expensive.

In the photos, my crocs Classics are navy, size M3/W5.  The sandals are actually the next size up (M4/W6), and though they are VERY slightly longer, they are significantly more narrow.  The crocs website categorizes both these shoes as &#34;roomy,&#34; but the inconsistency of the widths among their &#34;roomy&#34; shoes makes the designation almost meaningless to me. I have found that the Mercy Work, like the sandals, are narrow (though categorized as &#34;roomy&#34;), while the Classic (clogs) and the Bistro (specifically, the Bistro Mario Batali Vent) are comfortably wide for my wide toes.	2015-08-01

I love these.  These are my second pair of Sketchers Go Walk 3s, and I swear by them.  I have chonic pain, work 13 hours a day on my feet in a hospital, and these are the first shoes in 10 years that have made a difference.  I briefly think every new shoe I try helps- Danskos, expensive sneakers, orthopedic inserts, etc., but then I find either the pain comes back or a new, worse pain has started.  These shoes are so light you barely notice them, yet support you in ways you didn't know you were missing with other shoes.  They aren't the cutest thing, but there are more and more people at work wearing them. My joints certainly hurt less than usual after a shift, and I even felt less upset that I hadn't gotten to sit down in over half a day because my hips were feeling pretty okay for once.  These are a little cheaper in the stores, but I got them on Amazon day so it was worth the deal.	2015-08-01

I wear a size 9.5 running shoe and I bought a size 40. They have great support, I had a foot surgery when I was younger and the cheap flip flops were leaving me with a sore foot.

Quality made, get lots of compliments on the cute straps, I will buy Birkenstocks again when I need to.	2015-08-01

I purchased two pairs of sneakers and changed the sizes based on the reviews, and realized I have to return one pair for a larger size. My son wears a 9.5us so I brought a 9. He can just fit the 9 but i wished i purchased 9.5.for extra growth. The other pair was too small for his feet, size 8.5. I thought those sneakers would fit since many were saying to buy one-whole size down. Overall, the sneakers are bright and colorful and my son like how they feel. Its too early to comment on the durability.	2015-08-01

I purchased this purse in the Khaki colors and can't say enough good things about it! The woven brocaded fabric is REALLY PRETTY. The faux leather accenting looks and feels like real leather (soft and thick). The feathers are a nice touch too. The bag is roomy and big without being overwhelming. It has a few pockets inside along the purse wall and two, deep outside zip pockets on each end. I read all of the reviews before I ordered and there we're only a few complaints…One woman sent it back because the lining was unruly. When I got mine I could see where the lining material might want to come up and out with what ever you were fishing out of your purse. This was an easy 10 minute fix. I just threaded a needle and tacked the lining to the bottom in 4 places, perfect. The purse comes with a longer shoulder strap that can be used over the shoulder or lengthened to use as a cross body strap. One reviewer didn't like the longer strap because when she attached it she didn't like the fact that it connected to two smaller rings and it left the bigger attachment holes for the other strap dangling. The fix for that is to run the longer strap and hooks through those holes and hook the longer strap in from there. I did that and it looks perfect. This is a beautiful bag, goes with anything, summer or winter. I sprayed mine, strap and fabric too with Scotch Guard to keep it looking nice. I highly recommend this item!	2015-08-01

Wolverine often comes up short in their quality. These boots are comfortable for 2 to 4 hours if you by a decent insole as they don't come with any cushion. The toe cover appears to be a tough rubber material but is instead a cheep vinyl imitation cloth. The upper boot lace hooks are a good idea but these are next to impossible to get the laces to pop into their grove. Over all this is a sub-marginal quality boot with a price that exceeds the quality. Think of these as good disposable work boots, good for a few small jobs then toss then out with the trash.

They're a true black, which blends perfectly with my shoes. They are also extremely thin with a coating of wax that makes them stiff and strong, so they'll easily thread through even the tiniest dress shoe holes. The wax has the added feature of helping them stay tied. I would definitely measure your current laces to see what length replacements you need. Overall, these seem very high quality and durable, which is really all you can ask for from a shoe lace!<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.	2015-08-01

They may work for a stroll around the block but NOT for walking all day. I just got home and boy do I regret wearing them. I have blisters on both sides of my feet & my heals from rubbing.

I am a half size, so ordered a size up and they fit well, although not enough room for socks. They are comfortable and very sturdy. But after wearing these around the house with very thin socks, the top of my foot and my ankles began to swell. I was concerned this would be the case without socks, so I returned them for a lower profile shoe that did not come to the top of my instep. I got these instead http://www.amazon.com/MuckBoots-Womens-Breezy-Slip--Floral/dp/B00FHVWK5A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438457000&sr=8-1&keywords=muckboot+ballet and they are good. I would have preferred to keep the Bogs, though, because they cover more of the foot and seem like they'd be more functional for dirt and mud. If your feet don't tend to swell, the Bogs are a very good choice.	2015-08-01

She liked them, they looked adorable on her. But what on this good green earth are they made out of? First, the box was so light I thought they forgot to ship the shoes. However, upon opening the box I wasn't disappointed. They were there and they were really cute. The color was pretty, a nice cheery coral. It would be flattering on almost any skintone. The material was soft, which I guess was good because it made them comfortable, but they were so soft if you looked at them wrong they would scratch. Now here's the odd part. I didn't quite know what to make out of the crackling sound coming from inside the heel. They were cheap shoes, don't get me wrong, I expected the heel to be plastic or rubber or foam, even... But... They crackled? Were they filled with plastic bags and cellophane? I'm curious to know. Would I recommend them to a friend? Probably not. Would I buy them again for my daughter? I dunno. Maybe. She just cares that they look cute.	2015-08-01

My other pair of Bed Stus were the same size and fit perfectly but these were a tight fit-- came very close to returning these. Once you get these you gotta loosen the laces a lot, try get your foot in there somehow and walk around for a bit in order for them to &#34;break in.&#34; Bottom of the rubber sole had a little damage but whatever. If I wanted to exchange these for a half a size bigger I'd have to pay twice the price of what I paid because the pricing of these shoes is so skewed lol. They do fit decently now-- my suggestion; walk in them prior to help loosen it. Great boots overall.	2015-08-01

Appear to be well constructed but sizing will be a problem	I have slightly full feet but I have always been able to offset my &#34;tall&#34; feet by ordering a 1/2 size up. This has worked for me for decades with sneakers, boots, dress shoes and sports equipment (skis and hockey skates.) With the Wander Lace Canvas I eventually settled for a size that was a 1/2 size larger and a full size wider to fit in them comfortably.<br /><br />This shoe is really tight in the mid-foot exuding a painful pressure at the base of both &#34;pinkie toes.&#34; I can offset this discomfort with a medium-weight sock but I bought this shoe with the purpose of wearing it casually- With shorts and a light, thin low-profile sock. Nope, not with these puppies. After a half hour wow, my dogs are barking! It feels like someone wrapped one of those lobster claw rubber bands around my foot. All I want to do is take these things off. It took me two resizings to get the fit to work.<br /><br />Conclusion: These shoes look great offering a perfect casual flair to shorts but without the arrogance of Bass Bucks or the peppiness of Sperry Topsiders but sizing will be a challenge if you wear a D size or wider and/ or have full feet. Buy them but be prepared to send them back for a new size.	2015-08-01

I normally wear a mens 11D so I ordered an 11.5D this time and they fit good and are very comfortable. The height is lower than I expected so there's not much ankle support. Between this and being slip-on shoes, they remind me of slippers. I like the elastic cord instead of laces but it seems way too long. From the pictures these shoes look dark brown and black but in person they seem to have a tint of olive green and dark blue in them. There's a larger than normal loop on the back. I assume this is to help pull them on. I just hope it doesn't break after a while. I guess the arch support is about average. My feet are flat so any arch seems like a lot of arch support.	2015-08-01

I just had a disappointing experience with another pair of Merrells, so I almost didn't purchase these.<br />I really like the support they give me, so I went ahead and got them.<br />They are pretty light weight, which at first I wasn't crazy about, but now I think it just adds to the comfort.<br />The only thing that I found odd, it that the shoes have a much more &#34;boxy&#34; look than you can see in the photos.<br />I was ok with it because they are going to be a work shoe for me, if you are going for a more of a dress shoe look, you might want to think about it.	2015-08-01

These are replacing a 5 year old pair that are the exact same model and size. As expected, Salomon has made some upgrades to the shoe in the last five years but they are subtle and I assume were done to make the shoes more durable. I can't put my finger on what's different, but these don't fit me as well as my old pair. In particular, the shoe is plenty roomy, but on my first long hike, I got really bad toe bang where several of my toes turned black and blue. I've got the laces tightened down, so that's not the problem. I don't recall ever having the same issue with my old Salomons.	2015-08-01

I have this model in a variety of prints, all of which are very cool, making it easy to switch out my gear when I want to change my look. It's good in bad weather too (snow, rain) as it dries quickly -- this feature makes it easy to clean when needed as well (I just give it a once-over with a baby wipe). Highly recommended.	2015-08-01

When I received it right away I could smell the odor people were referring to but I must say, I aired it out for a couple days and it disappeared. I LOVE the wallet, the color is just beautiful! It holds all my credit cards and even my smartphone (w/o a case) fit in the zippered compartment. I love the lining in the zippered compartment it's very chic. I love that my cards and money are now perfectly organized. Thank you Yahoho for such a quality product. Oh by the way the it arrives in the cutest box.	2015-08-01

Plain and simple I have not bought a pair of Sanuks ever that I didnt like and trust me I own many pairs to include flip flops. These shoes are a must have for the beach or lake and I use them for airplane travel and around the house. I also would say these shoes have surprising durability as I still wear the first pair I bought in 2006. You wont find any negativity from me hereon Sanuks. I guess, I would recommend though to buy them in the off season (Got this pair at 27.00, Steal) as they are alittle pricey during the summer months.	2015-08-01

Now $60 is a lot to pay for a pair of flip flops, but I have worn mine for five years, and they are still in decent shape. They have lost a bit of support and tread from the bottom, and the toe strap is starting to wear. I could probably get through the rest of the summer, but I want to have another pair so I won't have to go a day without them in case my original pair fails. I figure at $12 a summer is worth it. I suffer from plantar fasciitis and have to be careful of my shoe choices. If I wear a pair of bad shoes, a couple days in these heal my feet. I have worn them to Disney World and around various cities on vacation. My feet are never what stops my touring around. Blow your flip flop budget on these. They will be your go to shoes for years to come!	2015-08-01

I started a new job at the front desk of a hotel so I'm on my feet all day long. When my mother in law suggested that I try and find some crocs, I cringed. I got a pair of cute flats and wore them for three weeks while getting blisters and trying to break them in, but my feet were still killing me at the end of the day everyday. I saw these on Amazon and I decided to give them a try because I was desperate. I've been wearing these for two and a half weeks now and my feet haven't hurt at all. They're ridiculously comfortable. I don't even think about how long I've been on my feet anymore. The first time I wore them to work I immediately got 3 compliments on how cute they were. I'm very happy with these shoes. I didn't have to break them in and they never gave me blisters! I have high arches and my feet typically hurt after wearing flat shoes, but these shoes have been amazing. They are kind of small and if I order again I might try and go up a half size if it's available, but they're really not bad and I've hardly noticed. I HIGHLY recommend these shoes to anyone who has to be on their feet all day but has to have more &#34;professional&#34; looking shoes.	2015-08-01

One last update - several weeks into wearing these & they are no longer comfortable. The foam has no support & my feet actually hurt when I wear them. I will NOT be reordering these.  I do hope Skechers brings back the original slide previously sold on Amazon.<br />Update to my original review - Have been wearing this shoe for awhile & I like it much less than at first.  The length of the shoe, as noted, is a little TOO short, the back edge often cuts into my heels.  Also, I've had to unexpectedly work a few long days & the heat from the foam base was just too uncomfortable.  Please Skechers, bring back the slide previously available!<br />This apparently is a replacement for a Skecher slide that I've bought many times over - loved that one. The overall fit of this Glam Sneaker is just a little short.  Gotta tell you, I don't care for the memory foam - my feet start to get too warm by mid-day at work.  Since I work part-time the sneaker will do.  However, I would much rather have the original Skecher slide available again.	2015-08-01

I was a bit skeptical at first. I have a pair of the heel inserts and the arch area in these is not as firm. I was afraid this would be a problem. It is not! I put these in my athletic shoes and have been wearing them every day/all day. I have plantar fasciitis and flat feet. My feet have not felt this good in over a year! Are they cured? No! Are they still sore at the end of the day? Yes, but it's more tired than sore. And they don't ache up to my knees and my ankle isn't hurting. This is major! I have tried many different inserts and these are, by far, the best. The only negative that I would say is this...they fit in my athletic shoes just fine (size 10). However they are too big for any of my other shoes. These were not the shoes I had planned to use them in. There is no template on the insoles for cutting them down and, more importantly, no indication if they are made to be cut down. I'm not sure if they will tear up if I cut on them so I'm afraid to do so. The insert itself, nor the packaging indicates whether they are made for this.....	2015-08-01

We got the shoes and they are absolute garbage. COUNTERFEIT!!! We bought the sand color and they have it listed as &#34;suede&#34; or something but it isn't anything close to even a faux suede material. We should've known that the price was too good to be true. We held the original Botticellis up next to the pair we received from these sellers and they were stiff and rough on my wife's feet, not to mention that the material was a lot thinner than the original suede Botticellis. You better believe these got returned.<br /><br />If you bought the original Botticellis then DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy these because you will feel nothing but disappointment.	2015-08-01

They're not shiny and the reflection is muted which helps the item look more expensive then what it cost. Don't get me wrong. No one is going to ask you if they're RayBans but they also won't think you got them on the cheap. The best thing about these aviators is the fit. Spring-loaded arms keep the sunglasses securely on your face without pressing into your flesh like some glasses do. The raised soft plastic nose pads are adjustable and go unnoticed while you're wearing the aviators, which was a concern because I usually avoid glasses with raised nose pads due to the pressure they cause. We'll see how long these puppies last but I'm pleased for the time being.	2015-08-01

(Perhaps I was sent a Men's size 8)  Obviously, there is no quality control in the factory.  There was a wrinkle stitched into the toe area, the flocking on the sole was already peeling off, and some of the threads were not well clipped. THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  Not to mention it will cost more to return them than they cost. Money to purchase them, labor to handle them , and fuel to ship them were all wasted.

I was so excited to know that Crocs made a flat that was not the ugly clogs that they're known for. After reading several reviews advising shoppers to get a size smaller, I followed suit. I wear a size 7 normally. So, I ordered a size 6. They are a smidge on the snug side, but I'm sure that they will stretch out a bit after they're worn a few times. They are like walking on nubby durable rubber sponges! Which in my book is definitely a great thing.	2015-08-01

Since I have bunions, I thought maybe these may be uncomfortable.  The lower straps are right in front of the bunions and are soft and flexible enough that there is no problem.

First off let me say that I've had several different pairs or many of the Go Run shoes over the years and this is the first time I've tried this Go Bionic Fuel,  they are awful.  All the other shoe lines are nice and flexible and made of a highly breathable material to keep your feet dry while out running.  Well not this pair, it is covered in a plastic material on about 50% of the shoe so my feet are warm and sweaty even while walking in them and they don't flex well at all, no wonder they were on sale for $25 (hopefully it's a discontinuation sale).  So needless to say I absolutely cannot use them as a running shoe, I brought them to work and figured they might be a decent work shoe at least.  Nope, they are hot as hell after just a couple hours of having them on.  Plus they are ugly as all hell compared to the other Go Run lines.	2015-08-01

Quality control problems	I'm giving these shoes a generous 3 stars because, for the 4 games and 6 practices I got to play in them before they broke, they were one of the best shoes I've ever played in.<br /><br />The good:<br />- True to size (9, Runs a little wide, which fits me perfect)<br />- Low profile (great for a point guard like me)<br />- Good stability vs weight (very stable/not heavy)<br />- Great lock down<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Insoles are bad and need to be replaced<br />- Straps are way too short, which makes it impossible to wear additional ankle support or even an extra pair of socks<br />- Straps break easily<br />- CUSHIONING COMPLETELY FAILED IN RIGHT SHOE AFTER WEARING TEN TIMES<br /><br />As you can tell by the all caps, the last negative aspect of the shoe is what did them in. I can't wear them at all. The left shoes is still function fine, which makes the defect in the right shoe that much more glaring.<br /><br />Great shoe. Too bad I can't afford to buy another $100 pair every 2 weeks ($2400/yr). Ultimately I would not recommend this shoe because of the durability issues.<br /><br />Lastly, I contacted Ektio directly today about the issue. I will update my review filling their response.	2015-08-01

Although they are hit or miss with how they fit me (more miss than hit), these pumps were just what I was looking for, so I took a chance.<br /><br />When I received them, I was satisfied with the quality. The leather is soft, the heel is a manageable height, and the strap fits around my ankle with no problems. However, the cutout part in the middle of the instep, for whatever reason, they dug into my skin. Plus, the design made my feet look weird. Lastly, they were a bit narrower than I would like.<br /><br />So as nice as the quality was, I had to return them because they just didn't work for me.	2015-08-01

It's a well built product, but I read in the questions section that this foot fitter works for high heels. That's definitely not true. It's too straight to fit into heels as the sole of the shoe is curved. And don't bother with strappy heels. I wanted it only for the strap around the sole of my shoes to widen. It didn't work. It's more limiting than I thought.<br /><br />So basically I can't use it for the reason I bought it.	2015-08-01

I ordered an 8.5, with the expectation that it might be a little large (I think they use Italian sizing, different from European?). Although the box says 8.5 M, the bottom of the shoes say 9.0/40.5, so of course they are huge-- feel like a 9.5 to me. Not sure if this is Amazon's fault or The Flexx's. I have one pair of sandals from them I like, though with some quibbles about quality (bad gluing on the leather seams). These Time to Rise flats, in addition to being too large, also had bad/no gluing all around the top inside edge (which really should be sewn instead of glued), and the brown finish was rubbed off/chipped in several places. For the price, the quality control of these shoes seems poor, which is unfortunate since they are cute, and seem like they would be comfortable if you could figure out what size to get!	2015-08-01

These slippers look and feel exactly as pictured but I didn't realize the velcro would be weak.

I have been looking for a Velcro closure shoe I can wear to the gym, but I have hard to fit feet.  One is bigger than the other due to a healed fracture, and both have very narrow heels and B-width toes (duck feet in other words).  I tried another Mephisto All-Rounder and was very disappointed in it, had to return it.  So browsing for another pair of Velcro Mary Janes to try, I could not BELIEVE the price on these, and also they are much cuter than the ones I sent back--so I had to give the All-Rounder another shot.  Glad I did.  I could adjust this one to a perfect fit for both my feet. And it's about as cute as these Velcro Mary Janes gets (except the Dansko Hadley, which is too nice for the gym).

These shoes will go with just about any dress pants for work for going casual with jeans.  Just a really cute and comfortable shoe that gives some pop to what you are wearing.

FINALLY, this shoe is perfect. Just got back from the farmers market and my feet could just keep going. As I ran upstairs and back down again, I marveled at how flexible they are and yet with plenty of arch support. Typically an 8.5 (39), too often my big toe hits the end of the shoe...not the case here. My feet are wide across the toe relative to my narrow heal...not too tight across the toes, no seam to rub...I wore them with light, low socks. PERFECT. I'm thinking of ordering a second pair before they run out of my size.	2015-08-01

I was considering buying mephisto's wedge sandal, but it was too pricy. These shoes are a better alternative, and the right price. Get a half size down. Also the only problem would be that the leather on the footbed will bleed onto the bottem of your feet, but just spray it with scratch guard, or  a water resistant spray for leather, and you're good to go. I'm considering buying another pair in tan.	2015-08-01

I do like the compliments I get from these glasses.<br /><br />One thing, since they are polarized, it makes it very difficult/impossible to read the heads-up display in your vehicle, if you have this feature.	2015-08-01

This isn't a shoe it's a shoe stretcher just to clear up the review questions. I bought this one after trying a less expensive model, this one holds up and does just the job it is made to do.

I am usually a size 7.5 and ordered a size 7 because of other reviewers' suggestions - and glad I did! They fit great. For the price they are good value. I did scuff up the front soon after getting them (I tripped over uneven pavement, whoops) and the scuff is very visible with some of the white inner material/sole showing through. That was a bit of a bummer but for the price I shouldn't complain.	2015-08-01

Totally worth the price: High quality genuine leather, VERY solid treads, and the arch support is awesome. It was like walking on a cushy carpet.  CONS:  That said, the toe section of the shoe is oddly wide, so much that when I laced them up, they scrunched up pretty heavily and made for a somewhat painful wave in front of the laces. My mom said: &#34;They look a little clown-shoe-y&#34;. In fact, this was only on the left shoe. The left and right shoes actually seems to be different widths.  I sent them back because of this.  Additionally, the site says &#34;order a half-size larger&#34;. DO NOT.  I normally wear an 11, and thought &#34;My feet aren't growing anymore, I'll order a tight 10.5.&#34;  Well, the 10.5 still left over a thumb of length inside. I should've ordered a whole size down to a 10.  If you order these, try ordering a half-size smaller - as they seem to run a little bigger and wider than you might expect. Otherwise an extremely high quality shoe that I think will last a LONG time.  FEATURES: As for the folding heel thing to make them into slip-ons?  It turns the shoe more into slippers. They don't feel very secure wearing them like that, even laced tightly. The shoes are quite light but still have enough weight that it feels really odd to wear them like that.  I'm going to order a size 10 and see what I think. I really want to keep these.  UPDATE: ordered a size 10 (half size under my normal) and they fit PERFECTLY. The toe area I still think is a little wide, but still extremely comfortable. High quality build again, will definitely have these a while. Treads are awesome too.  Con: the drop-in heel is interesting, but it's a little stupid. They aren't comfy enough to wear barefoot with the heel dropped in, and having a socked heel sticking out the back looks awful unless you're wearing brown socks.	2015-08-01

The Huaka is as close to a zero-drop shoe as Hoka makes.  I am switching between Altras and Hoka Stinson Tarmacs, and I thought I would add the Huaka to the mix.  I like the way they fit (I ordered in my regular shoe size) and how breathable the uppers are.  There is plenty of room in the toe box (although they are not as wide as my Altras) and my heel seats well.  They come with speed laces installed, but they also have a set of regular laces.<br /><br />My problem with the Huakas is the midsole.  While it has some give, it is much stiffer than the Hoka Stinson, which in turn is not as &#34;squishy&#34; as either pair of my Altras.  With my plantar fasciitis issues, the softer ride really makes a difference, so I'm afraid the Huakas will be going back.	2015-08-01

These are very cute but very poor quality control for Minnetonka. The two fringed pieces are clearly made from different pieces of leather. The right shoe is great and the fringe has movement.

Ironically, the heel of the shoe is somewhat wide and short which leads to some sliding. With a thicker athletic sock, it is a comfortable shoe that rides nicely during a run, and the zero drop is much appreciated. If you were to take the Brooks Pure Flow 2 body and add the Altra toe box, you'd have a winner!	2015-08-01

I have owned Birkenstocks for the last 30 years. I even keep a pair for a backup just in case something happens to the pair I am currently wearing.  I have never even seen a Birkenstock that didn't have a leather upper. That said, these shoes are very comfortable so I didn't send them back. I don't think they are worth what I paid for them. Again, I thought I was buying a leather shoe. The leather shoes take a little while to break in  - these don't. Birkenstocks have always been a great shoe for me but in the last few years their quality has gone down hill a bit. The last three pairs fell apart in about a year of continuous use. I used to be able to wear them for several years. If this pair doesn't hold up Birkenstock will lose a good customer.	2015-08-01

Both my girls consider them &#34;must haves&#34; for the new school year. More recently, we've started to purchase the Frosty waterproof model. My ten-year old is drawn to puddles and these mean that she can walk through them and still stay dry. Each pair lasts a year which is saying a lot. They are used for everything and are their favorite shoes.  They seem to provide great support, they are easy to slip into on your way out the door and they are nice looking. my husband has Merrell hiking boots and raves about them too. I've always thought they made great shoes, but I feel even more strongly now. I'm ready to get my own pair.<br /><br />This year I bought a pair for my older daughter that were too big on her. I tried them on and they were perfect. I never thought about getting a pair myself, but I'm loving them. They are so easy to put on and so so comfortable. I can see that I will want a pair every year too.	2015-08-01

This leads to accumulation of pebbles in the sandal which are very difficult to remove with the closed toe and raised edges of the sole.  I actually have to take the sandals off to get pebbles out.  I would expect to do this with a boot but I rarely pick up pebbles in a boot; on the other hand it is happens all the time with sandals.<br /><br />One would think that they would make great water shoes, however, pebbles raise their head again - I feel I am constantly having to take one or both shoes off to clear the pebbles.	2015-08-01

I had a bit of an issue finding the right fit; first going with a 44, then having to try a 43.5, then went back to the 44 with a thicker insole that filled it out nicely. Before there was issues with severe discomfort with the heel cup and a bit of room in the toe, but once I added that thicker insole everything is dialed in. Nice clean look and feel -- more aero with the BOA closure system than the traditional straps and buckles. Plus the colors are a perfect match for my Cervelo.	2015-08-01

I just received these and was very disappointed that they're actually as stiff as canvas sneakers, which I was trying to avoid by buying nylon as I can't stand the stiffness. I didn't want to bother returning them so I was going to donate them. However, one of my friends is a shoe salesman who happened to be here when I received them and he told me that if I soak them in hot water with fabric softener overnight they'll soften up considerably. He was right. They did soften and I put them on wet to go shopping this morning. The fact that I wore them only a couple of hours is misleading, however. The only time I wear shoes longer than that is when I'm going to be out of the house longer than that. I do not wear shoes in the house - ever!	2015-08-01

I am an adult that wears a size 8 in womens but had read a review that said they bought the big kid 6 size for an 8.  It worked.  My feet do not hurt.  I had a pair of L.L.Beans similar to these, the hiking shoe that can get wet.  My left foot was always hurting after wearing it half a day.  I don't know why.  These do not do that.  I am happy with my purchase.  My feet are wide and I find these a little on the narrow side so my left foot feels a bit snug across the widest part but it is not bad.  I usually just get wide shoes but the price for these kid shoes just could not be beat as compared to the adults.  The straps do stretch comfortable.  Nothing binds or cause blistering.	2015-08-01

I went through low 50 F degree mornings to a heat index of 111 in the South with rain and even hail. I wore these shoes with wool liner socks the whole time. They were great and much more comfortable than I ever expected (although obviously warm in the South, but not too bad considering).<br /><br />Good grip on road services when you stop even in wet conditions.<br /><br />These fit true to size and have a lot of arch support (I have high arches and these are great).<br /><br />Unsure about long term quality, it is questionable, I will update this review later as to how long they last long term.<br /><br />+++UPDATE 08/10/2017 :  I have rode probably another 9,000 miles with these boots on. I love them, I would buy another pair if Amazon had my size. Still holding up great and compare to much more expensive boots I have purchased.	2015-08-01

After a few hours, the open toe began to rub several toes as my feet slid forward in the shoe.  This is not unusual for me with slingback open-toed shoes.  I hadn't planned on wearing them all day.  They might be perfectly okay for someone with a wider foot who doesn't have problems with their feet sliding to the front of the shoe.

THE QUALITY IS AMAZING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN GET IT ON SALE, GO FOR IT!	Wow, these are just the best slippers ever. My husband wears ONLY slippers now and goes outside in them too. They are high quality and beautifully made. The memory foam footbed is really comfortable and the leather uppers are gorgeous. I'd been looking constantly to try and get more for him at an affordable price. These came up for only 22.00 in the size 13 so I grabbed 2 pairs. I looked at the price when they arrived a week later and it was priced at 38.! At the time I bought these the only one on sale was the &quot;chocolate&quot; color. All the other colors were much more expensive. Pays to keep checking it, or what the heck, just pay the full price and get them. They're going to be better than almost any other slipper out there even at their full price. This is the 3 time we've bought this exact slipper btw. He tried many other brands and we paid more and none was as good as these are.	2015-08-01

The heels are pretty solid, arch support is good, and I haven't had a problem with the snaps or the eyelets. I've had the boots about a year now (bought them in November of 2014) and wear them pretty regularly and as of yet they are still intact. I paid just under 30$ and I would say they've held up just as well as a pair of 60$ riding boots I purchased from Aeropostale.	2015-08-01

After almost 15 years, my old Oakley's were just worn out and they finally broke on me.  I didn't want to spend Oakley price, so I found these.  Most of the negative reviews I read had to do with the size of the frames.  I admit it....my husband tried them on, and the shape IS a little on the feminine side.  (He said &#34;girly&#34; but same thing).  I am a female with a smaller-than-average head size.  These frames are pretty much exactly how my Oakley's fit.  But they're better because they are polarized, which cuts down on the glare.  I love these enough that I'll buy another pair soon so that I have a backup on hand.  Bravo, Xloop!!	2015-08-01

Oh, I love this shoe! ...and hate writing reviews...that is how much I love this shoe.<br />This is my second pair. I wore the first pair every day...winter and summer. Due to several foot surgeries, I must be very choosy about my footwear. I wore Danskos for years, but the Alegra Classic replaced the Danskos because the Alegra Classic actually decreased my foot pain. I can only think it is the rocking design and solid structure that strengthened my feet. There was another surgery in my future, but that has been put it off indefinitely. Now for the one small CON... I have to say...they are UGLY. (That's it...nothing else.)<br />Bottom line/Summary: Because the Alegra Classic improves and heals my feet I will wear a not so pretty shoe....every day, rain or shine, winter or summer, at work or in the garden.	2015-08-01

My pair seems small for their size, but I ordered a size bigger and they fit well. I usually have to wear extra-wide shoes, but I can wear these comfortably (probably has to do with getting a size larger for length). Also, they have no arch support. I use expensive insoles to make up for this, which does change how they fit. Based on experience, I don't expect arch support in skate-style shoes, though I'm still befuddled as to why. The short length and no arch support mean losing a star, but trying these on (in a different coloring) in a store first helped me order wisely. Very stylish, I like the textile material. Less flashy, more classy than some of the other color options, which is nice because I wear them for semi-casual occasions and they work well with my twill khakis. Overall, I'm very satisfied.	2015-08-01

Just the right size for the &#34;necessities&#34; I like to have when traveling, shopping, going to the library, getting thru the day.  Plenty of pockets; some zippered.  As a matter of fact, my husband occasionally mentions how handy it seems to be.  I'll likely order an additional one although the Ocean blue is more versatile than I thought.  That said, I have found that I like to take a tote also if I'm going on a plane or long drive and need to keep track of newspaper, crossword puzzles, water.  I initially purchased the Plaza Mini but it was not big enough for what I like to have at hand:  money, cellphone/camera, a little things-to-do book, pen, ID cards, lipstick.	2015-08-01

I wear a size 7.5 and a 38 Narrow in Dansko classic clogs, but (as other reviewers commented) I had to get these in size 37. They are a bit tight across the toes, but I think they'll stretch. I ordered the tan/orange and black options. The black contrasted too much with my pale skin because it's a chunky sandal, but the the orange/tan pair was surprisingly cute and even gives the illusion of the sandal being more dainty and higher-heeled than it looked in black.	2015-08-01

This is my fourth pair of this Merrell style. I get a new pair about every two years because they are my favorite sandal and I wear them year round here in S Florida. It's light, comfy and durable and offers good support. I usually wear a 10 in a closed shoe but find that the 9 in a Merrell sandal works better for me and is more secure on my foot.  Pair # 1 died two years ago. I am still using pair # 2, which are probably 6 or 7 years old, as my beach and yard sandals.  Pair # 3 will become my around town pair and the new pair ( # 4)  will be coming with me on a cruise and be reserved for going out until they start to show some wear. I hope this style is never discontinued.	2015-08-01

I have had a few \"manly men\" scoff ..."	We use these in our old time photo studio for people to wear with our cowboy boots. We can have one pair of boots used 30 times a day by 30 different people, so keeping things hygienic is REALLY important. These help SO MUCH! While we spray our boots with a sanitizer as wel, it gives customers peace of mind to also put a little disposable sock on. The more we can do to protect our boots and our customer's feet the better! I have had a few &#34;manly men&#34; scoff at us giving them &#34;panty hose&#34;. But what are you going to do? It's a disposable sock! They are stretchy and we haven't found a person they don't fit yet! We've use them on size 5 kids up to size 16 men. They are a little hard to get &#34;open&#34;. I do have to help boy's and some men get the top part open so they can slide it on their foot.	2015-08-01

US	49570266	R3PMDWJ524JDRZ	B00PXMPP8C	976603442	Naughty Monkey Women's Soco Gladiator Sandal	Shoes	5	0	0	N	Y	Comfortable yet still stylish sandal - good traction	Was on the market for a pair of flat gladiator sandals with a little decoration. These really fit the bill of things I look for in most shoes: - leather - good traction on the sole - padded footbed - straps that hide my bunions - suitable for wide feet - feminine with a slight edge  Beyond that, this sandal looks well made and the thinner straps are feminine yet the gladiator style adds a little edge. The bling adds a bit of decoration, but not so much that it looks over the top. I picked this pair out of the pool I had pre-selected because there weren't too many straps, just enough to emulate the gladiator style I was looking for. Too many straps look fussy to me.  Paid a bit more than I wanted to for the tan color, but they are too perfect for my fussy feet to send them back. I've spent last couple of hours since I opened the box breaking them in and so far there have been no issues - pretty comfortable right out of the box. I do wonder if the thong between my toes will rub, but that is always a concern of mine when I wear these types of sandals. The criss crossed straps the ankle are a bit loose on me, but all the other straps fit well. One of the zippers is tight and does not zip down easily but that's not a deal breaker. I'll just rub a pencil in the teeth.  All in all pleased with the shoe so far!	2015-08-01

But, for someone looking for good arch support and an insole that isn't too thick/bulky in your shoe, my absolute favorite among all insoles I've tried is the regular Powerstep Pinnacle (blue color). I've bought and worn both Powerstep versions, because I wanted to see which would work best for me. And, IMO, the regular Pinnacle is a thinner insole than the Maxx, not surprisingly, but also feels like it has a somewhat higher and more supportive arch support element.<br /><br />In other words, my feet feel OK when I put the Pinnacle Maxx in my shoes. But my feet feel really great when I put the regular Pinnacle blue version in my shoes. And, I should add, I'm a guy who's 6-8 tall and about 275 lbs. So, if I'm getting good support from the regular Pinnacle, it's hard for me to imagine who's going to need more support than me with the Maxx -- unless for some reason, you just want a thicker insole in your shoe. As far as cushioning and comfort is concerned, I didn't find the Maxx to be superior to the regular Pinnacle at all.	2015-08-01

I think this is a quality brand. They do seem well constructed. However, I couldn't tell if these were actual leather sandals. They look like shiny fake brown leather sandals. Not really the look I was after and I'm worried that if they aren't real leather that the shininess will rub off after a few uses and then just look all scuffed. Of course, my toddler boy could care less. He thinks any shoes are cool. But the toe box is a bit more narrow than I wanted for my toddler's feet. I decided to return these and will buy a pair of See Kai Run sandals for him instead. They are made of real leather and have a wider toe box.	2015-08-01

I've always wanted to buy a pair, but never did, until I saw the Brandie dress sandal in red. I was looking for a red slide, and the price was amazing. I was super excited to get them.<br /><br />I was disappointed because they just didn't work. The length was fine, the instep fit well, but the insole was so, so narrow - my foot just hung over the edge, so whenever I walked I could feel it digging into my arch. Additionally, the silver accent part (along the side and the heel) is actually made of plastic, and it arrived a bit scratched up.<br /><br />So while they would have been comfortable if the width had been right, they just didn't work for me. I don't know if narrow is the hallmark of the Onex brand, but I might not order these online again unless I can try them on in person first.	2015-08-01

They hurt my pinky toe, regularly blistering them, or getting abrasions on the pinky toe. I had thought that once these shoes had had a chance to stretch out by wearing them over time, that this issue might resolve itself, but they have not. I don't think it's too small, but perhaps they are narrower than usual. I tend to think it's the construction of the shoe. Nonetheless, I'm quite disappointed with this shoe, as I usually like Clarks shoes.	2015-08-01

This means that it's both more durable and lighter than the Ektelon, which tore apart for me after six months. The bansic shoe is good... not much cushioning, but this makes it more responsive and quick. I think a better balance between shock absorption and responsiveness is available, but even so this is a good shoe at a relatively low price	2015-08-01

They have amazing grip- that Stealth rubber has incredible ability. I've used them on mountaineering routes amd sending some low-fifth class pitches. One thing I didn't consider but is fantastic is how easy they are to take on and off so you can save some time and energy while switching in and out of climbing shoes on route or at the crags. I chose canvas because I thought it'd be more durable in the long run compared to leather, but this has ghw drawback that they get rather hot. This doesn't bother me personally but it might bother some people. The canvas is fairly resistant to some exposure to mud and water but in a rainstorm or heavy water on trails or routes I wouldn't expect them to be keeping my feet immune from the elements. They feel much more comfortable after some breaking in. Overall, a very affordable approach shoe that does not sacrifice performance.	2015-08-01

Ok, so I ordered like eight of these types of bags from Amazon and this one is the best. The first reason is because it has only one large compartment with small interior zipper pouches off to one side while all the other  bags  had this  lame, useless middle zipper pouch which just collapsed to the bottom and got in the way, so finding things became  a chore. I bought the Tommy one for 49.99  which is my second choice but it's very heavy empty and has three compartments divided by that stupid pouch in the middle. I'd don't have time to fight with my bag looking for random items. I love this slouchy style it's so bohemian and  European looking, but it should be as organized as possible. Got the blue denim one which I love by  it's casual so will be buying the khaki too. One to travel with, one for the gym, an one for everyday for my laid back office in a beach community in Southern California. Carries my Kindle, a wallet, clutch for going out after work, a makeup bag, flip flops, and a sweater/hoody when it gets chilly at night for my drive home at the end of the day. So perfect for my life style and looks so cool.( Oh and the cross body strap is a bit long I know, I'm 5'7 so for me it's perfect )	2015-08-01

These are nicely made sandals as expected from Stride Rite. I liked the fact that they just have a velcro strap around the ankle and not a real buckle. The leather is nice and just have the overall quality you'd expect from Stride Rite. I bought a pair of Salt Water sandals also because I liked the look of them better as they're more hip and modern but the Stride Rites just had a better fit and quality so we went with those. These are perfect to go with my daughters dresses and for more dressy occasions. They do run about a half size larger than our regular Stride Rite size, so we sized down. They do have a bit of a heal on them as you can see in the photo so my daughters balance is off compared to flat soled shoes but these aren't our everyday sandals so we just deal with it!	2015-08-01

The heel height is perfect and comfortable.  The toe area could use more cushion for long stints spent standing but heavy socks might work as well.  These are a very light cream shade.  Exactly what I wanted. I ordered them to wear to opening day at the local horse racing track.  It's a big deal here and with a cute dress and a cowboy hat, I got lots of complements!

They sit on my barely-existent nose bridge and do not dig into my high cheekbones.  However, I'm very disappointed in Kate Spade's lack of quality control.  I've purchased 2 pairs from 2 different vendors, and they both have the same defect.  The left-side temple flares out more than the right-side temple.  Also, when lain on a flat surface, the right-side temple is completely up in the air.  Needless to say, both pairs sit very lopsided on the face.

I've worn these 2-3 days a week in a clinic position, where I am not standing all the time.  These have a clear plastic coating on them, and wear the natural bend of your foot is, these began to crack after about a month of wear.  Those cracks have now split, and the covering is peeling off.......and it peels  in frayed pieces.  They look like confetti.  Also, as they peel, the blue color comes off, so they're looking bad.  They're nowhere near worn out, but soon they'll be too hideous to wear to work.	2015-08-01

Running shoes are a very individual thing.  For me (short, slightly wide feet with high arches)  these are quite comfortable, provide pretty good forefoot cushioning and very good heel cushioning.  Heels hug very well - no motion.  They are stable, breath well and have good arch support.  They seem well-made and I expect them to be durable.  Sizing seems to be on par with the other major manufacturers.  Note - running shoes are supposed to fit very snugly with &#62;1/2 inch extra toe length.	2015-08-01

Like other reviewers, the inner lining fell apart- it fell apart after just one use so that was REALLY disappointing.  Minus the ugly peeling inside the shoe though, it is comfortable and cushioned.  The cushion does not hold up to all day wear, but it does provide more cushioning then the average shoe so I can't complain too much.  Have had them about a month, been worn about 3 days a week.  Not a terrible shoe, but for the price I would hope for more.  I can't say how long they will last, will update when they die.	2015-08-01

The wedged sole gives one a nicer lift than flats.<br /><br />I originally ordered size 5, and it was slightly too tight and patent leather doesn't really stretch. Size 5.5 fits comfortably. It slightly scrapes my pinky toes when walking around but I like it enough to order more pairs in different colors.	2015-08-01

Reading the other reviews saying these run large, I went down a full size from my tennis shoe size and boy was that the right choice. Ordering a size smaller is a must-- especially since this style of boot gets long and narrower and narrower toward the toe. In my opinion these would look much more badass if the toe portion were more square-shaped but oh well. Leather is nice, the black isn't really that black though, so slight disappointment. But yeah, order a size down otherwise they'll look way too big and goofy.	2015-08-01

Because it's now the middle of the hottest part of the summer I'm already used to the feel of the toe piece between my big and my second toes, and the leather seems more supple than it did in some of my others when I first got them.  The box says &#34;Habana, Waxy Leather.&#34;  I don't know if the waxy leather is different from the oiled leather or not.  I have two pairs of black oiled leather sandals that were pretty stiff when they were new, although they're now fine.  But the leather in this pair is much softer.<br /><br />Anyhow, these are comfortable right out of the box for me.  These are my first pair of Gizehs, and I love the look.  I have high arches and really need the support that Birks give. The color is a natural looking dark brown with just a hint of red.<br /><br />And one more word about the sizes.  I wish Birkenstock would start warning people that their footwear runs large.  I wear a size 9 in the US, a 40 in most European shoes, but a 39 in Birks.  If you've never bought them before, go in a local store and try some on til you get the right fit.  It could save you some grief.	2015-08-01

My wife in this case went with a (C) and wishes she also would of went (D) as after a few hrs her feet start to feel the narrow pressure. She has decided to keep them in hopes they will loosen up a bit over time and the fact this particular shoe didn't come in a (D) version.

The straps on these shoes are long enough, with an easily adjustable &#34;Velcro&#34; attachment.<br />The toe box is wide and high enough. The shoes are also lightweight.  Altogether they are more comfortable than lace up walking shoes, but the arch support is inadequate.  I had to add a cork insert.  It makes a big difference, but it is not the same as having the arch support as part of the shoe.<br />I haven't had them long enough to know about their durability and how well they fare in wet weather.	2015-08-01

I sprained my left foot in a fall a couple of months ago and was advised by the doctor to buy a pair of shoes with good support.

I've bought New Balance shoes in the past and had no problems, so I took a chance and bought a pair. What a difference these shoes made!

They are sexy and classy and the straps hit all the right places on your foot for a balance, elongated, and cohesive look throughout. (No weird peek-a-boo foot spots that throw off the fluidity of the design.) I bought these in black, size 7.  The top calf strap circumference is 13&#34; when the strings are completely pulled closed--but, they can be opened throughout to fit larger calves.  The foot insole width is 3&#34;, but the straps expand a bit outwards to fit a slightly wider foot.  The insole length is 9 5/8&#34; to the very tip.  The foot-bed is a bit tapered, so you might need to size up if your foot is longer then 9.25&#34; or of wider width, or else your toes will look crammed.  They are of a sturdy construction, comfortable to wear, and the tassels give it a nice finished looked.  They are extremely elegant and eye-catching, they do not look cheap or trashy.  Get these!	2015-08-01

I ended up having to walk all over San Franciso the first time I wore these.  Thank goodness they're comfortable!  I love the dressy patent cap-toe and scalloped edged opening.  The heel is a perfect height, more comfortable than flats IMO. I ordered a half size up after reading these reviews saying they're tight, (I have a really wide foot) and I'm glad I did!  I'm ordering them in another color today - I'll have the black leather, the nude leather and taupe fabric.  They're one of the most comfortable (and stylish) shoes ever! All leather, like most well made shoes, so I took them to my cobbler and had a rubber sole added over the thin leather sole just forward the heel ($25).  It's extended the life of the shoe considerably.	2015-08-01

I had to get a new pair ASAP as I have very high arches in my feet and I have never been able to find a flip flop that was able to fit my high arches. I also have a very bad knee ( I need to have a knee replacement but am putting it off) and these are the only flip flops that don't make the problem worse. I wear them everyday. I would definitely recommend these flip flops to everyone. They are the best. This time I ordered three pair... In different colors, that's how much I love them. Give them a try and you will never wear another kind of flip flop again!!	2015-08-01

These Keen surpass them in comfort and quality. Good bye Timberland...Hello Keen! ******And they're American made!!!!!<br />UPDATE:Coming up on 9 months of everyday use and I'm impressed. The inside of these shoes are so well made, I have 0 wear marks or ripped material inside of the boot. My old Timberlands would have been a mess! Wearing nicely and still as comfortable as the first day I wore them!<br />UPDATE:I've owned two pairs of these shoes. They are very comfortable but the LACE LOOPS HAVE RIPPED OPEN ON BOTH PAIR. They would of lasted much longer. Not very durable! Going to try the Keen's that don't have nylon fabric as the lace loops.	2015-08-01

They are easy to get off and on in summer and that helps save a lot of time. I have heard that they start to stink after awhile but my kids grow out of them before that can start.

I bought these on kind of a lark back in April for a Mad Hatter-style costume party. They've actually replaced my Electric sunglasses as my daily wear glasses. Super light. Great with baseball and driving caps. The polarization is really good. It puts some interesting colors on the world sometimes, and comes off as mirrored in direct light, so a very cool effect.<br /><br />So here's the fun part. I took these on a trip to the Caribbean, and they withstood a ton of abuse. Wore them in the ocean for nine days straight. Accidentally bent the frame in my fist diving into the water, and they bent back into perfect shape. Got hit by a wave while swimming another time, and they ended up in about 15nfeet of water, so I went and rented a mask and snorkel to go get them from the bottom. They were fine. Through all this, I only rinsed them with clean water until the last day when I used a little camp suds to wash them. Bent them again while they were stuffed in my backpack on the trip home, but easy to fix again.<br /><br />Great sunglasses.	2015-08-01

I was ready to return the ZX/3 and give up on Chacos when I came across the Zvolv. This newer model solved all my initial problems: it is significantly lighter, slightly wider so that my foot is perfectly cradled, and very easy to adjust. The sandal was comfortable for me on the first day; I walked my dog in them for 3 miles without problems. If you are debating between the ZX line and the Zvolv and you have slightly wide feet I would recommend the Zvolvs. In a side by side comparison the Zvolv are about 1/4&#34; wider than the ZX/3.	2015-08-01

Thanks to the Backpackers Shop, and trying on 7 different types of light boots, these were the winners.  I'm fascinated that people think these are narrow.  Asolos...those are narrow..for me.. My foot is on the way to being flat and while it isn't as wide as the Renegades, they still weren't causing any pressure like normal narrow shoes do.  That's the tricky part...feet...everyone's feet are completely different.  I had originally bought Oboz, and was in love with the style and how rock solid they felt, but THOSE started causing pain from narrowness, and the heel sole/heel area was so rock hard and stiff, every step I would take I could feel my brain rattling.  No shock absorption at all...but even with that, I would still rate those 5 stars.<br /><br />I was able to get a 10.5+ size which is fantastic.  10.5 was a bit tight and my toes were almost touching...The 10.5 + is perfection...or whatever reason.<br /><br />These are extremely comfortable boots.  I can't say enough about the comfort.  It reminds me of the old Merrells I had.  They felt like pillows on my feet.<br /><br />Haven't used these outdoors yet...I can tell the sole will have exceptional grip...will probably wear out fast since there isn't a ton of tread width...but I'm sure I'll get a couple/few years out of them.<br /><br />Bottom line for EVERY boot/shoe.. They will fail, they won't last forever and they will wear out faster in some areas...I accept that.  These should last long enough to get my money's worth.	2015-08-01

New Balance has been my everything shoe: black ones for work, other colors for weekends, and my fave has been the 847. Then the 847s started going away in my size, leaving me with the 847v2. This is the first and only New Balance shoe I have returned, and I have bought many. It feels very tight on my left foot, and the overall support and comfort of the shoe was very poor. I would never have guessed this was a shoe made by my beloved New Balance. The quality also did not seem as high, though of course the price is still as high as ever. It seems NB is moving away from made in america as well, which set it apart from a lot of the competition. I am exploring other options and I am willing to pay more for quality, good fit, and made in the USA. That used to be NB.	2015-08-01

I was looking for a pair of &#34;riding bootie&#34; style rain boots, and this pair is absolutely incredible! Elegant, sleek, comfortable and really snazzy! I use these for looking cool like a cucumber when walking my doggies in the park, where it can get muddy on the trail. And - yes, that's almost too much! - I even wear them in the garden, after a good rain drenched all my veggie beds. Hey, there is no reason for me not to look hip even when trudging around in some mud! A good rinse with the garden hose, and presto! All is shiny and pretty again in no time!<br />Of course, they would also look fantastic in the city streets, when it rains! I may try that the next time, too! The interior is fit with a soft fabric, and the opening of the boot is widened by releasing the belt buckle. They fit perfectly, as 10 is my regular size, and they fit to a T.<br />The price for these simply can't be beat, either!<br />I love them!<br />If you liked my review, please let me know!

The shoe runs short--I wear an 81/2 and the 9 was short.  My toes were hitting the end before I stood up and tried to walk.  These shoes are very cute and would have been perfect had they fit.  Other reviewers mentioned that the strap was short and indeed it was!	2015-08-01

I love them and thought I'd better get a back up pair to be on the safe side.  When I put them on, I noticed that they were super narrow. I've never really dealt with a shoe being too narrow before, so I thought it was maybe because they had never been tried on before. Wore them around my carpeted home (in case I needed to return them) for a few hours, but they never stretched out.  It's a real bummer because I adore the ones I have.  I guess the online version is not as wide? Who knows.<br /><br />Comfortable if they fit properly.	2015-08-01

I have rather large hands and they provide just enough extension without getting in the way or feeling bulky. If you play a lot... Or play heavy shooting games... Order a second pair as I have actually worn out 2 sets...(the thin plastic portion on the top of the Fangs has cracked allowing it to come off while pulling the trigger. Most definitely from overuse and me pulling on the trigger too hard) each set has lasted me probably 6-8 months of daily play on games like Destiny, CoD.  Still give 5 stars as they are inexpensive enough and last a fair amount of time for the cost and can always have a second set on hand so I don't have to go back to the o.e. triggers if one breaks! These coupled with KontrolFreeks... Look out Guardians!!	2015-08-01

Returned...	I was skeptical about this, but based on some reviews, decided to save money and go for it. I want a second set of plugs so I can move the Xbox from living room to bedroom without reaching behind cabinets. First, I read the label and compared to the OEM for Microsoft, and noticed this seemed to put out 1.5 more amps than the original, 17.4a v. 16a. Don't know much about electric stuff, but made me cautious. Then I plugged the unit in, and the fan started, and it was SOOOOO LOUD!!! What!?! After 5 seconds it shut off. Then I turned on the Xbox, and ten seconds later, the fan started up again. Oh my, this is weird because the OEM power brick has no fan. I scan the menu, watched a little bit of NFL through the Xbox, then shut the system down. The fan kept buzzing...and buzzing...and buzzing. After 11 minutes and then some, I didn't start tracking until 10:23am and at 10:34am, I had enough, and unplugged the unit, back into the box and returned. Looks like I'm paying for the original.	2015-08-01

Got product, but there is a short in the wire and the left thumbstick was broken, hidden underneath a new pad on the thumbstick, the &#34;A&#34; button was mashed in so far you could barely use it without mashing just as hard, also had to replace the bumper bar the right bumper was broken out of place. After all the replacements that I had to do and pay for I finally have a decent working control. For the price I spent on this I would have expected a product to not be damaged, especially without a notification on the page during order saying the product was damaged.  For the people complaining about it is not good for FPS, get better at the games or turn down sensitivity in game, I used to play FPS tournaments (more specifically Halo 3 and Reach) this control works fine for Halo 2, 3, Reach, 4, CoD B.O. II, CoD Ghost, Tom Clancy Seige Beta, Left 4 Dead 1 & 2. There is not a problem with the sensitivity.   There is however a problem with the seller sending out bad products. Better chance you have faulty product than you have a sensitivity problem.	2015-08-01

Maybe that means the craze is over, who knows? All in all, it was worth it to import, though the wait was a bit long.<br /><br />As to the amiibos, they are plush, not too big, I'd say about 3 to 4 inches tall. They have little cloth hooks on their heads to use as a key chain, if you so choose. Definitely one of the better amiibos so far.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting these if you are an amiibo collector, or if you just think they are cute.	2015-08-01

I really wish that there was never a product of The Walking Dead that I rated poorly. But ya know what? This game deserves it. First off, I should've assumed this game wouldn't of been good considering the makers of the first Spider-Man super hero games making a zombie game wouldn't of been good. The game is way to short, and not even good. You survive. You find Merle within an hour and the next 2 hours you just go from place to place to survive. The pre Oder said it came with a ear keychain. It was a printed out picture... You can't get cheaper man. The game wasn't advertised through the tv show during commercials (you can obviously tell why) it's so cheap, graphics aren't good at all but not (omg this is such crap and it brings the game down because of it) it's just horrible for a 2013 game, but not unplayable. You can peak Round corners pressing LB but the game didnt tell you that. You had to figure that out yourself. The games so short, and a cliche ending that's not even good, I've seen cliche endings before and at least they can be good. This wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good at all. Not bad at all, but not good. I beat the game within 1 day. Less than a day actually. This game should be free eventually through games with gold on Xbox, considering how bad it is and they will save money other than them giving a actual good game away for free. It's kinda cool you meet Andreas's parents. But tbh, that was the highlight of the game for me...	2015-08-01

Last June I decided to finally get in shape and lose some weight. Knowing how much I detest exercising I knew I needed to find something that I could stick with in order to achieve my goal of losing 40 pounds. I grew up in the 80s and was a video gamer through and through so when I saw there was a video game that included dancing and music, I had to try it. I purchased Just Dance 4 as my first one. It was great so after that I purchased Just Dance Greatest Hits, 2014, and 2015. In my opinion they are all great, some better than others.  The songs are also great. You get a real mixture of genres so most everyone can find songs they enjoy dancing to.  I just wish Nintendo would release more DLCs and more frequently. I was able to lose those forty pounds by last October and almost a year later have managed to keep it off and maintain using Just Dance and a balanced diet. I am so thankful for these games because if it hadn't been for them, this gamer would probably still be forty pounds heavier and vegging out in front of a different kind of video game. Thank you UBI Soft and Nintendo.  I am including an after picture and a picture of all the clothes that I donated because they didn't fit anymore.  Thanks to Just Dance and following a balanced diet (logging everything into the Lose it! app daily) I was able to lose the weight.	2015-08-01

It's great to be able to purchase a back up power supply so easily. We spend soooo much on our gaming systems nowadays. It's also nice to have back up cables for taking the system traveling. Needless to say, I am quite pleased that I was afforded the opportunity to review Fosman's AC Adapter Power Supply Cord for XBOX 1 in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. In the package you will get the power supply, with one detachable power cord.<br />I have quite a few Fosman products. I have always been happy with them, fortunately. I don't know about your TV set up, but we have multiple systems hooked up to ours, along with the cable box. It's not that convenient to disconnect everything. If we travel, and take a system with us to entertain our child, it's easier to unplug the system from it's cables and go. Much easier, if I may say so myself. This power supply is heavy duty. It's made well. It's well vented to prevent it from getting too hot. There are rubber feet underneath to prevent it fro sliding around or off the table, depending on your set up. It has built in LED indicator lights. I love having the LED lights on it, lol. I like to know when things are on and running, or not. Here are the specs on the power supply: Input: AC 100-240V; Output: 150W, 12V 10A. I couldn't find anything I didn't like about this product. I feel comfortable in recommending it.<br />I received thsi item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-01

Dance moves are also much harder to match on this years game. I'm a fairly good dancer and have maxed out most of the songs on JD4 and 2014 but a lot of the moves were complicated and not well illustrated so it's like being thrown into a moderately advanced dance class with no idea what you're doing. I also found a lot of movements, especially subtle movements of shoulders, swaying hips, etc. were not picked up by the Kinect very well for Xbox One. Overall I have to say I was very let down. It is a lot of fun to play, especially with friends and a lot of room to move around, but you're better off with a previous year.	2015-08-01

I agree with other parents on the comments: Its a great game, enjoyable with the kids, especially all the hidden levels and gates. You only need one of each trap for each element. And a &#34;trap master&#34; for each element as well, the smaller characters are not really needed.<br /><br />I actually purchased &#34;midnight express&#34; & &#34;Mirror of Mystery&#34; loose and open on Ebay for $12, compared to buying all the other useless stuff in the bundle. I unlocked the levels and didn't need the additional characters, plus is the levels you want to play.<br /><br />Now the hunt is on for a decent price &#34;light trap&#34; & &#34;Sun Scraper Spire&#34;, we already have &#34;knight light&#34; just need the other two pieces. Once again patience is a virtue. Game Stop, Walmart, Target are you best bets for getting items at the right price.<br /><br />I will note this, not sure I will continue with the Skylander SuperChargers, its probably going to be the same thing, people buying them up and marking them up to ridiculous prices.

The song selection is primarily electric guitar rock, which I like, but it's not really what I was learning to play the guitar for. I initially tried to get this to work with my acoustic using an acoustic pickup, and I had some success, but it's plainly designed for electric. The skills you learn playing can certainly be applied elsewhere, but if you're looking to strum an acoustic, you'll probably find this is not the product for you.	2015-08-01

Figures, right? lol Well, at least I still have these as replacements.  It should be noted that when I purchased this 5-piece set back in March 2015, the item was listed as:  &#34;eForCity® 5-Piece Retractable Stylus Compatible With Nintendo 3DS XL&#34;  It now lists &#34;Insten&#34; as the brand name instead of eForCity, but the product images haven't changed. Whether or not it's still the same set of 5 that I bought is unknown. Insten could be a re-branded version of eForCity, or it might not be at all. That could be the reason for some of the other reviews of people receiving something completely different than what's pictured, so, buyer beware when purchasing.  If you receive the stylus set as pictured, it's definitely a great quality set and one that I'd recommend if you need a replacement 3DS XL stylus.  If anyone wants specific pictures compared to the original, which I can do now, or if you have any other questions, feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to answer.  *** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***  I lost my original 3DS XL stylus, so for a while I used an old PDA stylus that I had lying around, but wanted something that would actually fit into the slot on my 3DS XL. A first party replacement from Nintendo would have cost more after shipping costs, so with this, I get 5 for less than the price of 1! Good deal.  These fit snugly into the stylus slot on the 3DS XL. I barely ever use them extended since the size of them when retracted is similar to the original 3DS XL stylus and that's long enough for me to use comfortably. I tend to only extend/retract them when I'm bored.  The tips on these are very smooth. No visible seams, and best of all, no scratches, so they're perfectly safe to use with the 3DS XL.  Overall, a great value and now I have four extras in case I need them.	2015-08-01

Where do we begin for one i already owned the imported version for the ps3 and sadly there wasnt anything new added to the game other then a useless mode called arcade mode. no new maps, playable characters, support characters or items from the shop. It was legit the exact same game i bought 2,3 years ago.<br />  Il start the review on a game aspect now. The amount of moves per person are disapointing there isnt nearly enough different moves before you realize your just pressing the same combinations over and over till every can preform a special then the ultimate special. The story mode is a joke there is some false claim of free roam that makes it seem like you can go and do what you want. With the same generation enemies that continue to float around no matter how many times beat them. Truthfully this game isnt worth the hype there is other games id much rather play. Like One piece pirate warriors series, even the naruto ultimate ninja games and the newest dragonball xenoverse. Plus the storys dont last longer then 6 hours so dont waste to much roaming around just do the objectives. Or youll waste time for a poorly made stories. theres 3-4 seperate short strories which are all pretty much the same unfortunately.<br />  The games most focal point was suppose to be the online battles/ co op. which was completely broken with certain characters being way more over powered then others. Also find ways to continue a chain before you hit the ground like it was marvel vs capcom. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.	2015-08-01

Very unique.	I only paid 45 bucks for this and it was a returned item to Amazon.  I would give it 5/5 stars if it had English as a language option.  It only has Japanese which makes it very unique and I was able to update it to fw version 4.5 and get it configured exactly the way I want it.  So I can play games on this without worrying about the region.  It is a really cool device and unique since they didn't come out with this in white in the USA and probably never will since the New 3DS XL is already out.  I have wanted a white handheld nintendo system for years and this was a really excellent deal.<br /><br />Menus in this are in Japanese but they are really easy to navigate since I'm used to the US version and I can get tutorials on youtube or just power on a US console if I want to figure out where specific things are.  Everything works great.  I haven't checked out the power supply but if it isn't compatible with the US wall socket, it doesn't matter since power supplies for these are cheap and I already have a few from other systems.  I have charged it fully fine and it works perfectly.	2015-08-01

The controller works flawlessly with no problems. It gave me no problems when playing games on both the Wii and Wii U. I have played both motion heavy games (like Wii Sports Resort) and button heavy games (like Super Smash Bros) and had no issues with either. Not to mention that this thing glows really brightly and just as good as I expected. It is also compatible with Wii Motion Plus and fits regular Wiimote jackets. There are only two minor complaints about this controller which firstly is that the + and - button placements are different than the original Wiimote. The original has the buttons surrounding the home button in the center but are now moved higher on the controller surrounding the A button. The Home button has also been moved adjacent to the power button but that didn't bother me especially because I prefer that design better. The + and - buttons do take some time to get used to however. The second gripe I have with the this controller is that the safety strap does not have the clasp but rather the plastic slider. Not a big deal at all but I much prefer the clasp. For $25 though, and including the nunchuck, I would not only recommend this but buy it again.	2015-08-01

Being able reuse items without another play through like in some modern versions of games and unlock special events that are no longer available makes this a very worthwhile buy. The only downside is mine did not come preloaded with games or a USB link cable to download with as advertised. I have to input my own, and so it took some trial and error to check that everything was working. Once I confirmed that, however, it has been useful. Codes can be long, so I recommend putting in only one at a time along with the master code to minimize typos and the risk of accidental data corruption.	2015-08-01

I'm a fan of several of the anime series featured in the game (Jojo, FOTNS, YYH, DBZ) and love playing as those characters.  Unfortunately, the story is dull and repetitive (I barely have the energy to get through 1 campaign let alone 4 all with characters I don't really care about) and there isn't much reason to keep doing it once you've unlocked all the characters you care about for the other modes.  The actual fighting is pretty wonky and is mostly just hitting the same buttons over and over until its time to block and repeat.  The worst problem with this game is the split screen multiplayer. 4 player split screen would be perfect for this game considering the matches are almost always 2 v 2, but the game only allows 2 players.  Adding a second player also makes the screens incredibly small, about the size you'd expect with 4 players in Halo for example.  As much as I like having a game with all these characters, this was a disappointment.	2015-08-01

We already had it on the computer, but my two older boys really wanted to be able to play it together. So, we got this for them, and they love it so so much. I have strict restrictions on the amount of time my children play video games, generally 1 hour max per day. But, this is the ONE game that I often make exceptions for. The creativity I see when they play, with the amazing things they build and are SO excited to show me, makes me so happy! The calm, soothing music it plays instead of fast paced, quickly-becoming-obnoxious, loud music and sound effects that accompany most kids video games out there today. I actually enjoy hearing the music when they play and have been known to tell them that they can turn up the music a few notches if they like!!!  Also, the conversations between them as they play, as they talk about creating things, and how to create them, and think of new ideas... it's just refreshing. I never thought I'd actually enjoy seeing my kids be so involved in a video game, but Minecraft is SO different.	2015-08-01

Ok, I know I'm going to get bombarded by the fanboys and downvoted but I just can't pander to anyone. It's not in me and the game should have been miles better than it turned out to be.<br /><br />I played through the PS3 Arkham games, including Origins, which was lackluster and doesn't really count in the trilogy and was more a cash grab than an actual cohesive game. My expectations were pretty high for PS4's Arkham Knight. What did please me was how the game looked and the story. That's about it.<br /><br />Where to begin? First of all, the gameplay. Batman can do everything he does in the previous Arkham games. The problem is, they designed the missions so that you are forced to do what they want you to do, as opposed to before, you could basically choose how you want to attack the path you're on. They decided to add a lot more gadgets to Batman's collection, which on paper sounds cool, that is until you're going through the daunting task of hacking into a blimp's controls to tilt it and clear the path you need to follow, or using a voice synthesizer to open a gate or distract guards, or blinding flying drones or turrets, so you can take out the guards around. They made it needlessly more complicated, seemingly for the sake of it and the slowing down of Batman is not a very welcome concept, at least to me.<br /><br />Also, it gets frustrating how often you die and have to re-attempt the missions. The drone tanks (and especially the cobra tanks) and the gangs of baddies have been seriously amped up in difficulty. Particularly when it you get to the siege of GCPD near the end, expect to want to throw your controller into the TV, and then of course remember how much money it costs and just hit the wall instead. The upgrades help but it will take quite awhile to get enough so that it makes a big difference. Not only do you have categories of upgrades but you also have levels of upgrades on top of that and you have to buy this upgrade to unlock these upgrades. It's sofreaking convoluted!<br /><br />Once you finish the main storyline, it isn't actually done. There are also a large number of side missions and in order to unlock the game's finale, you have to complete a number of the side missions. I finished the Own the Roads side missions, or so I thought. I did all the ones marked on the map but now I have to &#34;find&#34; the rest of the locations? Now I know why it was a mistake going further than the ending in the first place. Come to find out, there are actually 2 finales. You get to see one if you finish 7 of the side quests (which means all the missions within each side mission string). If you want to see the ULTIMATE FINALE, then you have to do 100% of all the missions. Nuts to that! I mentioned how annoyingly convoluted this game is, didn't I?<br /><br />When I finished Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I actually felt compelled to do more side missions because the play through was fun. Definitely not the case here. I really wished I could get into this but I left the experience exhausted, frustrated and not the least bit excited about how the rest was going to turn out.<br /><br />Edit: Ok first of all, I forgot to mention the Batmobile. It is super clumsy, handles really rough and is a pain to use. They made it so that you have to use it waaaay to often. The Riddler missions where you are racing are super frustrating and I know I mentioned the drone battles but let me elaborate. It gets really difficult to defend yourself against tanks that shoot missles, tanks that shoot cannons in 3 different directions and flying drones at the same time, especially when they are in great numbers and it's in waves, meaning, you destroy one group and think ok, I'm almost there but nope, they replenish their numbers about 3 times. It's impossible to complete the harder ones of these until you've fully upgraded the Batmobile's weapons and gadgets, which like Batman's upgrades, will take awhile. Another super annoying thing about drivingaround, even when you're on a mission, is running into cars and people constantly. All the cars have bad people, so when you get close, it triggers a mini-mission, which will override what you're currently attempting to do. That happens also when you're not in the Batmobile. If you have a waypoint set and are following something or someone, you will constantly be bombarded by surveillance of people talking and it will confuse you by telling you how far they are and take you off track from your goal.<br /><br />Now, I don't know why, maybe I'm a glutton for punishment but after taking a break from the game after finishing the main storyline, I decided to go back and do more side missions. They are easy enough when you first start out but then start to get super hard as you get toward the end of each. That's not my main problem though. For some reason, it doesn't give you all the locations. As you clear a bunch out, you have to search for the rest of the waypoints. I've now reached the point where I've completed almost enough to unlock Knightfall protocol except one and for every mission I have left, it tells me I have to look for them. So that's how they reward all the work you put in? You have to go looking for everything? I think I'm really ready to put the game back into my shelving unit for good again and looking up the endings on youtube.	2015-08-01

One of the controllers would not work with the battery back cover it had due to battery corrosion. I searched online on ways to clean the corrosion out and got most of it clean. Unfortunately there was one contact that I just couldn't get clean enough to make the controller work. I knew it wasn't the controller itself because based on a YouTube tip of how to put batteries in without a cover, the controller worked fine. Minus that it kept disconnecting during for my son due to the batteries getting slightly jostled while he was holding it, even with it taped up. I checked Amazon for battery cover replacements and voila! It was cheap enough to give it a try. It came within 2 days (thanks Prime!). I inserted the batteries and snapped it onto the controller and we were in action! It works as it should. It fits our controller perfectly. My 3rd child can play with his siblings without getting upset that his controller doesn't work. Saved me the cost of buying another controller.	2015-08-01

I got this for my birthday the year it came out.  Actually, my mother took me shopping and i was able to choose 2 games.  I choose Legend of Zelda and, although i hadn't really heard of it before but i liked the box art,Final Fantasy.  I ended up never playing all the way through Legend of Zelda but i have beat this game countless times over the years.  The story is simple yet keeps you involved and the game play and ability to upgrade your characters is superb.  It was also a very long game when it first came out compared to most.  Endless party combinations and strategies make this one you will play over and over again and i usually do beat the game again ever several years or so even now.  I highly recommend it!	2015-08-01

Wasn’t sure about it from reading some of the reviews, but there were enough good reviews and to make the purchase. Now after testing it out for the day i can tell you it is a very well made product. Has a great feel. Has a slot to attach the nunchuk at the bottom of the grip. But in my opinion what makes this the best Wii gun on the market, is its digital connection between the wand and grip that allows use of its unique Trans-Port Technology. THEN last but not least there is a switch at the bottom of the grip that you can switch the A and B buttons ( the trigger and guns hammer ).  With this feature it puts this gun in a  level of game n play compatibility that no another gun can. A must have.	2015-08-01

I was excited to set it up, but it took an hour of tinkering around with random settings to get it to work in the first place.  I ended up following the direction of 3 youtube videos until one worked.  Something about the drivers not updating properly and I had to manually set the controller to pick the correct driver (which was downloaded from microsofts website) in the services application.<br /><br />Finally, I got it to work and gave it a try with a few steam games to make sure it worked.  Happy, I set the controller aside and waited for the weekend.  I quickly unwrapped the second one and put it in my backpack along with my laptop to head over so we could play.  I unwind my controllers to find the second one didn't have a USB port... it only connects to an XBox!<br />Did I order the wrong one and was lucky enough to have 1 good controller?  Or was it an infuriating blunder that was made on their end?  I'm pretty sure the latter since many other reviews say it works fine on the computer.<br /><br />Unfortunately the game we wanted to play did not support 1 keyboard and 1 controller user.<br /><br />I dropped a star because the drivers were not easy to figure out for someone that isn't the best with computers.<br />The other star is actually how comfortable I am with controllers(tried it out on another game). Perhaps it will grow on me over time, but I prefer the feel of a Playstation controller.  I like both analog sticks to be at the bottom.  Unfortunately they're more difficult to set up than XBox Controllers.  My comfort is a personal preference though.  I normally wouldn't knock a star off, but having to deal with returning and ordering another one still has me peeved.  Half star for each.<br /><br />Update<br />I couldn't get the adapter cable to work, my computer doesn't recognize what it is.  I didn't want to bother learning how to fix yet another piece of hardware that doesn't work out of the box.  I just spent 10 hours getting a mouse, the first controller, and a drawing tablet to work on my laptop.  So, I ordered another controller.  I checked the back of the box, and it shows an image of a USB port.  Again, this one does NOT have a USB port, and it doesn't not come with an adapter of any kind. This is the second time I've been burned ordering from here, and it won't happen again.  I may as well just go to a gaming store the next time I have a chance so I can see the thing before hand.s getting a mouse, the first controller, and a drawing tablet to work on my laptop.

I also am a steampunk fan. Third-person shooters are a good time as well as I always liked Gears of War. The Order 1886 consisted of nothing but a huge letdown for me.<br /><br />It seems like 75% of the game consists of boring cutscenes that you can't skip. It almost is like one of those lame movies your teachers made you watch that you had no way of getting out of watching. I am fine with some cutscenes if they actually are more than people yacking for 20 minutes and are fluid with the flow of the game. That's not the case at all here.<br /><br />Aside from the cutscenes, there is some basic platforming thrown in. This will consist of about 15% of the rest of your time. The remaining 10% is actually action and shootouts. Not only is this obviously disappointing for a &#34;shooter&#34; game, but its also even worse because the shootouts are a pain in the neck. The camera angles suck. The game does have a decent cover system even if it is borrowed from other games like Gears of War. I don't mind that, but when every time I get hit while shooting I get thrown out into full stance and have to re-do my cover, what is the point? Isn't the point of cover when you get hit to be able to stay in cover and not start all over again?<br /><br />I am just glad I rented the game. That and the graphics were the only good parts of the game. I was really hoping to like it, but in the end, I decided after a few hours that it felt like I was getting robbed of time trying to continue to play this frustrating game. It's just not enjoyable at all.	2015-08-01

Please note that this game is the sequel to the DS title &#34;9 persons 9 hours 9 doors&#34;. Virtue's Last Reward will spoil some of the big reveals of 999, so if you plan to play that game, please play it first and then play this title.<br /><br />Without giving anything away about the plot of VLR, I will say that it is an incredibly deep story with a lot of surprise twists and relentless intrigue. Often I had my theories reduced to ashes by one bombshell after another, and very rarely did I call something before it happened (and boy does it feel good to predict something in this game). The game is not all visual novel, though. Half of the game is about escaping a room by solving the puzzles contained within. Every room features unique puzzles covering a broad range of subjects from math to riddles, to three-dimensional puzzles and code-cracking. There were a number of rooms that had me scratching my head, but often all I needed was to take a break and come back to the game later.<br /><br />The puzzles are not the only interaction you will have in the game however, during the visual novel, you will often get opportunities to dramatically alter the course of the story through choices. The most important example of this is a 'minigame' called the 'Ambidex Game', or 'AB Game'. Unlike the previous title, the nine persons in VLR are all working towards a very important end-goal - to collect a total of nine 'bracelet points' or more. By doing this, a given person can open the number 9 door, and they and anyone else with nine or more points can leave the prison the participants are trapped in and escape. Anyone left behind is trapped forever. Because the storyline can be altered, there is naturally a lot of different endings to achieve (including a good number of 'bad ends'). If you ever feel like you made a mistake, or you simply want to try something different, the game has a built-in flow chart that you can access at any time, and use it to 'jump' to different chapters in any point in the game you've previously been through. This way, you can jump back to before a crucial decision and change your mind, or jump out of a puzzle room you're stuck on and start a new path in a different storyline.<br /><br />Moving onto the participants and their goal to escape, I should briefly explain how they earn the points necessary to escape. To earn points, the participants have to play the AB Game, where the participants choose between two options: to Ally with the last person they chose to join forces and solve a puzzle room with, or to Betray them. The incentive for both options breaks down like this: If both parties choose to Ally, then both parties gain 2 points toward their bracelet point count. If one party votes Betray, however, the traitor(s) will gain 3 points, and the ally will lose 2 points. If both parties vote to Betray, then both parties are locked in stalemate and do not lose or gain points. Each of the 9 participants begin with 3 bracelet points, and if they fall to 0 or negative bracelet points, or break any of the rules imposed on them, they are instantly executed with a lethal injection from their bracelet.<br /><br />This AB Game is based on the 'prisoner's dilemma', and is just one of the few concepts this game explores. Sometimes the storyline delves into intense scientific theory and investigation, but thankfully the protagonist is more of a Watson than a Sherlock, and asks almost all the immediate questions players may have when exposition kicks into high gear. So even if you have never heard of something, you can be sure you'll have a grasp on it soon enough.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the cast, but to even begin would be to open the floodgates to a large reason why I love this game, and risk spoiling things for the uninitiated. Simply put, the cast is diverse and infinitely interesting. You will never figure each member of the cast out in the first meeting you have with them, and just when you think you know them, they'll reveal something about themselves that you wouldn't expect. Sometimes you will be shocked, sometimes you'll be furious, and sometimes you'll love the characters even more.<br /><br />Buy this game. If you love games with a strong cast and a story that you can't help but immerse yourself in, then this is one title for you. If you've never played any of the Zero Escape games, then you should consider also playing 999.now them, they'll reveal something about themselves that you wouldn't expect.

I threw my Keurig & Mr. Coffee away!	I just got my MLB 15 The Show today from Amazon. This is my first purchase of this baseball series. I have not bought a baseball game for any of my consoles since World Series Baseball I & II for my Sega Saturn over 14 years ago I think. That baseball series from Sega was awesome and my best to date. So last week I bought for $10  RBI 15 from the Sony Play Station Store. The graphics are sub par for what I expect of todays consoles for a baseball game. The overall feeling I got out of RBI 15 series was just ok but nothing special. I think I will take it off my PS4 to make room for a new game soon.  Now comes MLB 15 The Show and I have to agree with all the reviews I read. This game is great to look at and plays super. This game is superior to the RBI series game easily! The visuals are super and the players are very detailed. I showed my girl friend and she asked what Baseball game I was watching? I told her I was playing a videogame of a baseball game and she was like................ No Way! Wow they make them look so good now. I agreed with her and told her I am impressed with this game. I mentioned of lots of reviews on this game and that I bought this game a bit cheaper for the Anniversary edition. Because Amazon had other distributors selling this game. So this 10th Anniversary version was priced the same as the regular version on the Play Station Store for about $38.97. and this usually sells for $50 there. I am very happy with this purchase. Even the practice sessions as a pitcher or hitter are awesome to play. I spent at least 3 hours in the practice mode. So I could learn the timing and where to look for the sweet spot to swing the bat. My eyes are not the best now that I am 53 and believe me I used to be good at swinging at baseballs on videogames. Well not anymore and this game was a joy just to practice that. I give this game a 5 star rating!  And LaTechNmore props for selling me this game just as they advertised for much cheaper than other places wanted! Update 8/16/2015. I have had a few weeks to play this game. I played a little over a week the practice batting and pitching modes. I wanted to make sure how to judge and hit the ball plus learn the varieties of pitches. So today I started my first season playing. I am so amazed on the camera angles and visuals on the graphics. The players have facial expressions that the cameras catch and the announcing gives this video game a 95% feeling of being a real game!!! I cannot understate that remark that this game feels like a real game!! I bought Mega Baseball for the Xbox1 recently. While visually that game is cartoony, the mechanics of the game is very good. But Mega Baseball on the Xbox1 cannot compare visually or anything else for that matter.  The Show MLB 15 has blown me away that every time I play I see something new. Even the errors while I don't personally like my team to make errors. I'm thinking wow this game even makes mistakes realistically! I watch baseball now rarely compared to when I was in my early twenties ( I'm 53 ). But this game keeps me from playing any of my other games I recently purchased. Godzilla, Driveclub, Project Car, and Mortal Kombat X, and Shadow of Mordor. But I am happy to do that when a game not only looks but plays superior! For once I have to give it to Sony for putting together a masterful work of art! Sony has made little if any effort in making first party software for the PS4 this year. That is very odd considering the PS4 cannot do any wrong. The PS4 continues to dominate the console wars since the PS4 launch. At the very least Sony could pump some games of it's own into this cash cow system! Bravo for MLB 15 The Show!	2015-08-01

Long story short, one of the sticks base was slightly warped and it was rubbing on the underside of the top of the controller.<br /><br />I really liked how the stick felt, so I figured I would just order another set and return these.<br /><br />Well, got the new set in today and while they LOOK the same, the new ones are not rubberized AT ALL. 100% CHEAP PLASTIC! Absolutely ZERO grip to them. They feel like sticks you would get if you bought one of those knock off controllers in a 99 cent store.<br /><br />The funny thing is, they knew they were sending me cheap plastic sticks because they included rubber grip tops. Bright PINK rubber grip tops.<br /><br />So looks like I will be playing the Amazon lottery and continuing to return and order more of these until I get two of them that are what they advertise.<br /><br />I saw another review here stating he also got cheap, non rubberized sticks. So beware folks, it really is all luck whether you get the good ones or not.	2015-08-01

All they needed to do was cut and paste the halos into 1 game right..... They did a whole lot of cutting not a lot of pasting. You are no longer able to have unique armor with different shoulder plates and such now you must choose a full set of armor no changes besides color. Now to my last and favorite part forge you'd think with the new advances next gen brings they would have used that power to fix problems they had in halos prior (halo 4). Yet when you forge on halo 4 it still makes you wait for the lighting every time you leave the editor. I found this game a huge slap in the face from 343 not even to speak of the servers or how bad the layout of matchmaking is set up. I will not be buying another halo game from 343 ever again -An old halo fan	2015-08-01

However, I am having a lot of fun with this game. It has it's flaws; Movement is weird at first, graphics are middling, and the game is repetitive. At first, I was pretty unsure about the game, as I played through one complete cycle of the game as Godzilla. As I played through another, more familiar with the controls, it was a bit more enjoyable, and then again after leveling Godzilla up was even more of a blast, and then I played through as King Ghidorah, whom I had unlocked, and the play style was different, and incredibly fun.<br /><br />I think this game has many flaws that will make it a terrible game to most people, but it really does play like a Godzilla movie. As a huge fan of Godzilla, that is what you want, to fight monsters like in the movies. I've played and love Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Melee and Godzilla Save the Earth, but they were fighting games first more than anything and you never really felt like you were fighting the other monsters like in the movies. This game pulls off the weight and feel of being a giant monster so much better, and it is so much fun when a new monster shows up that you haven't fought.<br /><br />I think there is something special here for a hardcore Godzilla fan. If you are looking for a great fighting game, this isn't one, but I think it is a great Godzilla game. I'm looking forward to unlocking the other half of the monster list I have not encountered yet, and giving them a run.	2015-08-01

If you do not have an audio controller adaptor  (a small device that allows the game controller to accept other brands of headphones) you can buy one on Amazon for approximately twenty-five dollars.<br />Turtle Beach has produced the economical Ear Force Recon 30x headset for the hardcore or casual gamer alike.  Although, by design, this headset cannot offer the player an immersive game experience like other models they do provide clear and distinctive chat with volume control and mic mute.  The generously padded ear cup is very comfortable and slotted to allow the player to hear the game audio from the television.  This is a great headset for chatting with your teammate but, as previously mentioned, you will need to hear the gameplay on your television's speakers, so married, late-night gamers might want to invest in more expensive models that can broadcast both gameplay and chat through the headphones for the sake of not disturbing one's spouse's beauty sleep.  With that concern voiced, I would recommend  this model for any team or land party players.	2015-08-01

I had the plain old Doom 3 for the old Xbox but I had to get this edition for all of the extras. It was sure fun to play the original Doom and Doom 2 again after all these years. Lost Missions was kind of fun but very short and Resurrection of Evil was entertaining and provided about 4-5 hours of gameplay. My biggest complaint though, and why I didn't give this a full 5 stars, is the amount of lag you start running into. I forget where it started but the lag got pretty bad in spots later in the game :( Another complaint is that in the old Doom 3, you could either use your weapon or your flashlight, not both. It added to the game's creepy settings. While it was nice to use the flashlight whenever, it just wasn't the same and felt like you where cheating or something....	2015-08-01

This replacement works fairly well. A direct replacement for the old joystick. When installing, the Z button doesn't fit as snuggly in place as the OEM module. A little finesse when installing and it isn't a problem.  I've noticed the spring is stiffer so its harder to make accurate movements in games (I.e. aiming, walking tight ledges). After using these replacements for about a month, I can say they are reliable and are a good option for a worn out joystick.<br /><br />A note for when disassembling the controller, loosen each screw little by little. If you remove each screw one at a time YOU WILL BREAK THE STEMS. Same goes for when reassembling the controller.	2015-08-01

The top part of the headset is now broken, but it's nothing a little duct tape can't fix ;)<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great volume control on your ears (Loud Noises don't seem so overpowering)<br />- The quality is unmatched by the competition, unbelievably great for gaming, especially competitive players<br />- Simple Mixamp<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Mic noise when you move it (Not a problem if you turn voice all the way down on your mixamp)<br />- Durability. It needs to be taken care of very seriously, don't through it around. Not much of a con, just common sense I suppose<br />- Mic Quality. It is very poor, in game, or for recording audio on your computer. It gets the job done, but it's not useable for commentary.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the quality of the sound, which is the reason I bought it.<br />I personally had a bad experience, with getting over 4+ faulty Headsets before I finally got one that worked.

For the most it has an upgraded combat style that the previous games had, yet it was inconsistent with its own continuity when they made this as a prequel to the Arkham games.<br /><br />1) The story is a big build off to an empty climax that went 0 to 60 & someone decided to use the emergency brake halfway there in order to end the game. I honestly thought a bit better from WB Games, but I can't be bothered. Don't play this game without playing the others, in fact don't play this at all if you didn't like what you read at the beginning of this bullet point.<br /><br />2) I didn't find as many problems as people reported, mostly due to having the lastest updates installed. However, I did find some frame drops (lag), some freezes in random points in the game & a weird, yet funny animation quirk when knocking out a thug.<br /><br />3) The multiplayer has aspects of the Assassin's Creed & Uncharted one which really baffles me in a way. I stopped playing it after realizing that & that some unfair balancing issues will make you play with unfair & overpowered opponents.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't get this if you want to start out the Arkham games, if you want a better experience check Arkham Asylum & then City. You really don't need to play this game unless you want to see a ruthless Batman otherwise leave this game for another day.	2015-08-01

Males from age thirteen to thirty will find everything they could possibly want in this raucous romp: scantily-clad anime girls running around with katanas and chainsaws murdering zombies by the flesh load. Perhaps the best part about this game is that it is completely honest about what it is, which is no doubt reflected in the sub-60 dollar price range, $40, if you download it on the PSN. The game doesn't hide the fact that it is an over-the-top murder-fest with busty anime girls in cowboy hats, swimsuits and lolita outfits panting and huffing and puffing as they hack and slash their way through hordes of zombies and outlandish-looking bosses. Despite the fact that the game would no doubt make Anita Sarkessian have a heart-attack, there is a surprising amount of depth in the game-play.  Each girl has their own myriad of weapons and move sets and the ability to switch between the four girls in the middle of combat adds a new element of strategy (yes strategy) when confronted with enemies who won't go down by the typical method of hack and slash. There is a wide variety of modes with challenges that range from easy to surprisingly hard that unlock extras such as items, weapons and new outfits (or lack thereof) for the girls to wear. Level design is mundane and straightforward and most of the graphics have been reserved for the girls themselves with most of the zombie and boss models looking like they would be more at home on the Wii. The soundtrack is as catchy (and annoying) as and STD and you'll be surprised as to how many times you find yourself coming back to this game for its over-the-top and explosive combat, g-string and all.	2015-08-01

I've heard a lot of good things about it and I love the freedom of sandbox games. When I first started playing, I was having a lot of fun, but that fun turned into boredom just a few days after getting the game. From what I had heard and read, Minecraft had tons of things you could do and lots to explore. Although I'm sure the PC version has this, I wasn't very impressed with the Xbox360 version. With this version, your world is limited. This didn't bother me at first because I had heard that, although it was limited, you still have a big area to explore in. In fact, I kinda preferred it to be limited because it was so easy to get lost. Well, after getting the basics down and getting to know the area around my house, I wanted to start venturing off, exploring, gathering new materials, etc. only to find that this so-called &#34;limited but large&#34; world is, in fact, not large at all. After just an in-game day and a half, I had completely circled the entire map/island and explored all that could be explored. The map that was generated for me only had one small village, and after two in-game days, they were all dead from being unable to protect themselves from monsters. No temples, no dungeons, no pig men, the absolute only thing of interest was the small, now-dead village. From looking at the achievements, I saw that there are 23 possible biomes, yet there was only 5 in my map(Desert, jungle, grassland, plains, and alpine?). It even took forever for horses and donkeys to start spawning!<br /><br />Because there were no villagers left, I was forced to start a new game. I haven't done much in this new game, but after just a little bit of exploring I found a good-sized town, a desert temple, and horses that were previously ultra-rare to find in the previous game, even after they started spawning. I'm hoping that first map was just bad luck and that most of the generated maps aren't so boring. If it really was just a fluke, I'll be much more impressed and change my review, but for now, I'm not all that impressed.	2015-08-01

So I bought the white version of these for my white cased Ducky Shine 4 and loved it so much that had to get the black one for my keyboard at work. Upon installation, I noticed that the molding for certain keycaps were not fully compressed, making it unable to fully latch on to the keyboard switch. So when it's on the switch, the key either gets stuck or you can't bottom out smoothly. Also, for the keycaps with numerals and symbols, the number does not light up but the symbol does. I think for the white keycaps, the light bleeds through a lot more so the numerals are able to light up. The black is more conserved, and therefore less bleeding in light.The original ABS Ducky keycaps has both the number and symbol lighting up.  I can live with this, but I just find the lack of consistency of mere annoyance.<br /><br /> Fortunate for me, Amazon has a great replacement policy so I can easily swap out the defected keycaps. I just don't understand how my white keycaps were made without fault, but the black keycaps were poorly constructed. If it wasn't for the inconsistencies, I would've given this 5 stars.	2015-08-01

What I like about this Wii remote is the fact that the Wii Motion Plus block is built in to the remote so it is smaller and lighter than an original Wii remote with the Wii motion plus block on the bottom of the controller. I also can play games that use the Wii Motion Plus without the block thus making the controller smaller. Also I can play with 3 Wii remotes on Wii Motion Plus games like Wii Play Motion, Wii Sports Resort, and Fling Smash. Also this controller works on games that doesn't require the Wii Motion Plus accessory like Wii Sports, Mariokart, and Wii Play. (BTW I have 4 controllers. 2 controllers WITH the Wii Motion Plus block on the bottom, 1 Wii remote WITHOUT the Wii Motion Plus block on the bottom, and 1 of these controllers with the Wii Motion Plus built-in.) So I can play Mariokart/Wii Sports with 4 controllers and Wii Sports Resort with 3 controllers!<br />The photos are my Wii Remote Plus vs my old Wii Remote WITH Wii Motion Plus block added	2015-08-01

PC games, online games, and bonus features on DVDs were my ways of playing video games at home. And when I spend time with another adult, I would play the playstation 2 and the Wii. It was amazing. I impersonated the game in many ways. I did it at recess when I was in elementary school, I set up polly pocket figures standing behind the emerald city, etc. Some of the games were tricky back then. If I was to play this now, I would nail every level down. Arranging flowers was fun. I don't have the CD anymore because I can't play it on my computer. So I had to sell it. The only game I find hard in this was when you feed the penguin colored fish. This was when I learned the word &#34;Nincompoop&#34;. It's so sad that kids don't play those kinds of games anymore. Nowadays, kids would play consoles like Playstation, Xbox, and Wii. They also play games online more and on their phones and tablets. I managed to play CD-rom games when I had a miniature PC computer. Then in December 2012, I had issues with it. It was fun. I even recalled myself saying that I was 8 when Dorothy said that she was 8. I even remembered seeing myself heading to the kitchen to turn on the lights and this was sitting on the kitchen table.	2015-08-01

A master piece of survival horror that is beautiful and use the WII U gamepad in a good way,  It's the story of 3 characters set in a moutain known to be a favourite suicide spot, Mount Hikami.  Yuuri Kozukata is a young woman that lost all of her familly in a car incident and since then, she sees the deads.  She was saved by Hisoka Kurosawa before commitng suicide.  After the incident she lived and work for Hisoka in her Coffee shop.  Ren Hojo is an occulitst writer and  is searching the death pictures that were taken century ago for a book.   He asked Hisoka to find a lost book and some photos got his attention.  He and his assitant Rui will help Yuuri to find Hisoka that dissapeared searching for a lost girl on mount Hikami..  Miu Hinasaki is a teenager in search of her long lost mother (Miku Hinasaki), she believes she is somewhere hidden on mount Hikami .  The story of the three will merge in this incredible adventure.  Pros : Gorgeous graphics, the WII U is pushing 1080p graphics on the screen and in the same time produce a great picture too in your WII U Game pad.  It's one of the few games where the WII U game pad is really usefull.  You use it as the Camera obscura.  This created the most fun ghost battle of the series.  The story is great  too and the characters likeable.  This was the longest Fatal Frame story, over 10 hours of gameplay.  And you don't need to beat the game on hard mode to see all the endings.  Cons: The game must be played on a Japanese WII U (well until they release the game in the west this fall).  The annoying over exagerated breast mechanic from Dead Or Alive 5's engine.  Let's hope they will reduce the bouncing as we can in the DOA5 games so it looks more natural.  I had notice some graphcal slowdowns in some scenes, but nothing game breaking.  Not enough  unlockable content  to add replay value.  So yes, I bought a Japanese WII U to play this game and I do not regret it since I can play all the WII Fatal Farmes games on it too.  Itotaly worth the price for me.	2015-08-01

I bought these relatively cheaply over a year ago, when I was getting ready to go to college so I could play video games and watch Netflix without bothering my roommate. I used it primarily for my PC, but tested it out on the Xbox 360 when I could - it works fine on that, too. No testing for PS3, but I presume the same could be said for that. For the $35 I paid, they served their purpose. The sound was nice, the mic picked up my voice clearly, and the ear cuffs had a fair bit of padding. Not the greatest headset in the world, but not bad. My only complaint is that the metal headbands feel like they're biting into you over continued use.<br /><br />My first day, I tried them on and thought, &#34;I'll get used to it,&#34; as the bands created an uncomfortable pressure right off the bat. It was either too loose or too tight, or too low on my head to cover my ears. After an hour, I did get used to it - but two or three hours left the distinct sensation that the bands were trying to morph my head to fit them, instead of adjusting to fit my head. The netting was alright, but it did nothing to distribute the pressure more evenly, to the point that when my roommate wasn't in the room I'd often wear the headbands around my neck or sometimes upside-down to avoid putting the bands on my skull again. The whole thing felt kind of heavy, which encouraged the around-the-neck listening with the ear cuffs vibrating under my jaw. This problem is probably on a person-by-person basis, as I have a relatively wide head.<br /><br />I have to give Gioteck props for the quality, though. While I was worried about the joints at first, I quickly learned that there was nothing I could do to break them - including accidentally sleeping with the headsets under my pillow for a week or having them fall onto the hard tile floor in the middle of the night. The wires lasted through a year at a party dorm, though during the last few months I noticed a slight ringing that was alleviated when I touched the audio jacks - no idea what could've caused this, as the jacks were never plugged into my TV. The cuffs have a reasonable bend to them, though it will take some adjusting to see how they best fit on you. If you have pronounced cheekbones, you may experience some discomfort initially, but angling the ear cuffs back should help with that. If you wear glasses like I do, the sensation of pressure building up may get to the point of headaches, so I'd recommend either going without your eyes or wearing contacts if you have them.<br /><br />It won't break on you. Aside from the ringing near the end, I have no complaints regarding the sound. If you're looking for a pair of headsets you can abuse, these are it; but if you're a stickler for comfort, I'd look elsewhere.	2015-08-01

I played through up to the first half of the Alice in Wonderland quest before I stopped playing indefinitely.<br /><br />To be honest maybe I'm just getting too old for video games, as despite having grown up seeing most of the Disney movies that the Kingdom Hearts series references, I could not understand the convoluted plot of this game at all.  Also Kingdom Hearts is clearly not Final Fantasy, as the battle system is more action-RPG oriented, so that was a bit of a turn off.  Goofy and Donald as AI controlled characters also appear to be abjectly useless in battle.<br /><br />Maybe if I was younger I would have appreciated Kingdom Hearts for what it was, but alas, as an adult gamer I could no longer understand or identify with this series, which is a shame because I've heard good things about it, so don't let this one review dissuade you.  However it may merit doing some research into the game, story, and mechanics before committing time and money to this series.	2015-08-01

The first time as a CD and installed it on a computer in my office.  I have a great time playing it.  I wanted the same opportunity on my laptop, so I could play while sitting in m my rocker recliner and listening to the radio.  First, I purchased a download.  Never could register it.  Made many attempts and even phoned.  My daughter, who works daily with computers could not get it to work.  So I finally gave up and removed it from my laptop.  Well, did it again.  I purchased it as a CD from amazon.com.  I installed it on my laptop.  Experienced the same problem.  Could not register it.  This time when I phoned, I got nothing but advertisements.  I turned 80 years old in February and don't need this agravation.  What I need is a game to amuse me while sitting in my rocker recliner.  Can't believe I fell for t his twice.  Have to chalk it up to old age.	2015-08-01

It's been around a month now since I first got this system so I've decided to give a review. First off its interface is nothing like the 360's which was very strange ay first. It all flows like water, with multiple ways of being able to do the same thing, the snap system where your able to run apps while playing games, the DVR which can record your gameplay, and all the improved features. It really did do well in all fronts for me, but the only thing I wish this bundle did separately was give a physical copy of the master chef collection rather than AN 80GB DOWNLOAD. Like my lord this not only took a while but straight up massacred my internet for around 13 hours. That may be because my internet is nothing superb but still I would have preferred to have those 80GB free and had the disk instead. Either way, an amazing buy and I highly recommend it!	2015-08-01

US	34334729	R179NXCV3VKND6	B00BGA9Y3W	352118775	Destiny	Video Games	4	2	2	N	N	Solid Co-op Shooter	I recently decided to take the plunge and play Destiny. I was holding out for a good price, and also for my friends to get it as well so we could all play together. That was the right decision, as Destiny is a game best played with friends, but more on that later.<br /><br />I've put in 98 hours and brought two characters up to level 32. I've only played the base game, not the DLC (which is not included in this disc). The first thing to know about Destiny is that it is an online only game. You will need a fast internet connection to play, and it is a good idea to have PS Plus as well, so you can play with other people. It is possible to play by yourself, but single-player quickly becomes boring.<br /><br />The basic gameplay in Destiny is this: You create a custom character, go out into the world alone or with up to two friends and shoot aliens across four worlds, all while leveling up your character and finding better guns and armor. Everything you do in Destiny gets you one step closer to becoming more powerful. When you start, there is a 15 hour campaign that will take you from Earth to the Moon, Venus, and finally Mars. Each planet has about 6 missions, each one with a very basic story loosely tied to it. You start, a little exposition is given by your Ghost (a robot companion) and then a waypoint marker appears on your HUD. You go to that point, a little more exposition is given, and then you're tasked with taking out three waves of enemies or a boss, and then a short cut scene plays and the level ends. This same formula is repeated ad nauseam for the entire campaign. The story is, unfortunately, never more than your Ghost telling you that enemies are doing something bad and you have to kill them all to stop them from doing bad things. The only thing that keeps this all from becoming super boring is the enemy variety (which is about on par with Halo) and playing with friends. As a single-player affair, it quickly becomes dull. There is also a curious lack of vehicles, with only your Sparrow (similar to the Speeder Bike in Star Wars, but with no guns) and the Pike (an enemy Sparrow that also has guns), and in one level on Mars, the Interceptor (a tank-like single pilot vehicle with heavy weapons). 95% of gameplay is on foot, which is unfortunate since a larger variety of vehicles might have saved the game from a bad case of repetition.<br /><br />Once you complete the main campaign, the game changes slightly. You still play through the same levels, but now how you advance is different. Before your character reaches Level 20, you earn Experience Points to level up. But once you reach the soft cap of 20, you now have to equip armor with Light Points to level up. In order to get this armor, you need to earn Vanguard Marks or Crucible Marks by playing the game over and over. It becomes a grind, but again, if you're playing with friends like I did, this shouldn't be a problem. Earn enough Marks, and you can buy new guns and armor from Vendors in the social space called the Tower. You can also find random loot drops from enemies that can provide you with guns and armor, but these are very unreliable. 98% of the random loot drops will be inferior to your current equipment, and buying equipment from Vendors is the only sure way to get the necessary Light Points needed to level up.<br /><br />The point of leveling up is to tackle new challenges. Each stage in the game has a recommended level, and if you are at or above that number, the enemies should be a moderate challenge. If you're one level below the recommended number, the enemies will be much more difficult, and if you're two levels below, well, I hope you have life insurance, because you're going to die. A lot. You cannot take a mission more than two levels above you, and taking on a mission below your level does not make it exponentially easier. There is a damage cap, so if you're Level 20, a Level 3 enemy takes just as many shots to kill as a Level 19 enemy. As you get into the higher levels, there are Strike Mission, Heroic Missions, and Raids that will reward you with Strange Coins, Marks, Glimmer, and crafting materials all necessary for obtaining more powerful gear. And that is the cycle of Destiny. Play harder levels to get better gear so you can play even harder levels and get even better gear.<br /><br />The controls in Destiny are rock solid. If you're familiar with Halo, the FPS mechanics are almost identical. I am a big fan of the gameplay in Destiny. It is tight, responsive, and fluid. I never once felt out of control or like the game wasn't responding properly. Both the campaign and the competitive multiplayer play fantastic, and everything from the feel of the guns to the dynamics of the player/enemy interaction felt spot on. Bungie is known for excellent FPS gameplay, and Destiny doesn't disappoint. There is a good variety of weapon types, each with a specific use in different scenarios. You have your primary weapon, usually a mid- to long-range rifle with a decent sized ammo clip. Then you have your special weapon, either the close quarters shotgun, the super long-range sniper rifle, or the mid-range fusion rifle, all with fairly small ammo clips and less frequent ammo drops. Finally, there's the heavy weapons, a mid-range machine gun (huge clip) or the rocket launcher (very small clip), both with very infrequent ammo drops. Since you can only carry three weapons at a time, the trick is finding the right balance of weapons to compliment your play style. I can honestly say, balancing issues aside, that there really isn't a bad weapon in the bunch. I tend to favor the Hand Cannon and Shotgun, but really I like all the different guns in the game and found them all to be useful at some point.<br /><br />The graphics in Destiny are also a high-point. I've seen a lot of great looking games on the PS4, and I can honestly say Destiny is up there with the best. The game runs at a native 1080p/30fps and looks incredibly sharp. I've never been great at sniping on the older consoles, but in Destiny I can pull off headshots effortlessly with Hand Cannons, Scout Rifles and Sniper Rifles. I attribute this to the crisp resolution, which allows me to see the finest details even far off in the distance. The aesthetic of the game, from the character design to the distinct look of each planet, is well realized and executed. I never confused a fellow player for an enemy, and was able to keep my bearings even during heavy firefights. Even the technical side, like the lighting, textures, and ambient effects, is impressive.<br /><br />Destiny is, as I mentioned earlier, an online-only game, and this presents a few issues that are worth mentioning. First off, you will need to buy a PS Plus subscription to get the full experience. Second, if you have any internet issues, this will impact your game, even if you're playing by yourself. I actually had a couple weeks where Comcast was working on the nodes in my area, and during that time I'd frequently get dropped from my game, even when playing by myself. The third is that other people's connections will have an impact on your game, especially if you're playing in the competitive Crucible mode. In Crucible I noticed a delay between when I'd fire and when an enemy would take damage, a delay that wasn't present in the Campaign. I'm not sure if that was my connection, or the other player's, but it seemed worth mentioning. But mainly it's unfortunate that there isn't an offline mode for those times when a stable internet connection isn't available.<br /><br />The upside to having an online-only game is that the online functionality is excellent. Joining friends is quick and easy, and playing with a group of friends is a blast. Comcast issues aside, I never had any lag playing cooperatively with friends, and voice chat sounded clear. One player is the Fireteam leader, and it's quick and simple to start new missions, taking your friends along automatically, or assign a new Fireteam leader and let them choose your path. The interface is very user friendly, and matchmaking with strangers for those times your friends are offline is pretty darn fast. There isn't matchmaking for the 6-player Raids, though, which is unfortunate but understandable, as Raids require a level of communication and teamwork that strangers probably couldn't do. Also, each planet is filled with other Guardians (players) who are fighting enemies beside you in real-time. One of the best implementations of this are the Public Events. These are short, 3-5 minute events where an enemy ship will drop something and you'll have to either guard it, or kill a very powerful enemy before he reaches a checkpoint. Everyone playing in that area, regardless of whether or not they're in your fireteam, can join in and work together toward a common goal. It's a lot of fun to see lots of players working together for a few minutes.<br /><br />The Crucible is the competitive mode for Destiny, and it's pretty good. There aren't very many modes: There's 3v3, 6v6, Control (King of the Hill), and a 12-player free-for-all. Beyond that, there's a few other modes that are locked behind a DLC wall. There is a decent number of maps, around 10 or so, but you'll see the same ones come up again and again. The good side of this is that you'll quickly learn the maps, which is essential to victory. Also, all of your weapons and armor carry over to Crucible, so if you have an Exotic weapon like Hawkmoon, Thorn, or The Last Word, you'll have a serious advantage. The negative side of this is that if you don't, you'll be eating a lot of lead. In fact, I'd estimate that at least 60% of my deaths in Crucible were at the hands of those three weapons. Even if you don't have Exotic weapons and armor, you can still have a good time in Crucible, and even if you lose you still earn Marks and gear, so you never feel like you're wasting your time.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with Destiny is just how boring it becomes by yourself if you play single-player. You can reasonably play through the 15 hour Campaign by yourself, but after that much of the game is just re-playing the same missions over and over at a higher level. Doing that by yourself becomes tiresome fast. This game really has to be played with friends to be enjoyed, but man, if you are playing with friends, it's one of the most fun experiences on PS4.<br /><br />If you're buying Destiny for the Story, don't. It's worthless. But if you're buying to play with friends, you'll have a good time. If competitive multiplayer is your bag, you may want to look elsewhere, as what's here is a little bare bones. As for Bungie's 10 year plan, I'm honestly surprised I played for 98 hours, but I think I've squeezed as much juice as I can from what's on the disc and I don't see myself playing much more in the future. Bungie wants players to pay for DLC to extend the experience, and I just haven't seen anything compelling enough to justify paying what they're asking. When Taken King comes out in a few months, it might be worth checking out, but only time will tell. How much you'll get out of it will depend on how much you're willing to put in, both time-wise and money-wise. For now, if you have a stable hi-speed internet connection, PS Plus and a couple of friends to play with, Destiny is well worth picking up, especially now that it's under $30.	2015-08-01

You don't have to this which is VERY hard, I got to expert wizard rank by going in caves completing expert-master challenge as a adept so do NOT think you must do quest X to get to the higher rank.)<br />You can choose what life you want there are ton of choices-forgive me if I forget some<br />(paladin, tailor, blacksmith, miner, carpenter, wizard, angler, woodcutter...)

PC games are so laggy they are unplayable (if you can get the macros to work properly), Android syncs easily and are playable but you have to account for the bad response time. It would have been a nice feature to make the USB actually function as a playable connection.

The d-pad is a circle shape, but works the same way a normal d-pad would otherwise. The A and B buttons are on the upper left and right corners and the start and select buttons are combined into a single button which you push left or right. If there are games that require pressing start and select at the same time, this won't actually work. Otherwise it does function accurately, but is awkward to hold.<br /><br />It's definitely for people who want to mess around with different controllers. Maybe challenge yourself to see how far you can get in Super Mario Bros. or do a game night  where everyone has to use an odd controller to play some level like flight controllers or the Power Glove.	2015-08-01

You know the one; very attractive, great smile, nice frame, intelligent, but there's a certain aspect of her personality that really frustrates you and gets on your nerves. That fatal flaw is the one thing that's preventing you from falling in love with her, and taking the relationship to the next level. Some days, you feel like you're very close to falling in love with her, while other days; you question why you continue to tolerate her. You definitely like her, but you don't love her. So close, but yet so far... That's Bloodborne in a nutshell.<br /><br />Combat - Bloodborne has the best combat I've ever seen. It's simplistic, yet complicated. The main attack buttons are R1 and R2, with L2 being used for the left-handed weapon. R1 can be used for a 'light' attack, while R2 is the 'heavy' attack. I enjoy the combat because it's quick and seamless, and there's not a lot of buttons to remember. Although you don't have to, I suggest locking onto enemies before attacking them; I found that to be easier than not locking on (mainly because of the camera). Bloodborne encourages and rewards aggressive combat, so it'll be in your best interest to 'be on the offensive' as much as possible, and here's what I mean by that: If an enemy hits you and depletes your health, you'll have a short window of time to attack them and replenish some of your lost health.<br /><br />Weaponry - Some people took issue with the low variety of weapons, but I sure didn't. I stuck with the same weapon (Threaded cane) for the entire game. Now, if I had an interest in other weapons, there were some nice options available. I'm not sure how many total weapons are in the game, but I'm guessing at least 10 of them. There are a couple of ways to acquire weapons (for what it's worth, you'll start off with 3 to choose from, and you'll have to pick one). The easiest way is to acquire a badge that allows you to purchase certain weapons. You can acquire these badges by defeating specific enemies. The other way (the harder way) is by finding the weapons that are well hidden within some of the environments. Although I didn't use any of the other weapons, I still wanted to collect them all (trophy reasons), and I had to rely on my strategy guide in order to find some of them. For the people griping about the lack of weapons, I thinks it's important to point out that several of the weapons are 'trick weapons', meaning there are two weapons in one. For example, the Threaded cane can be used as a cane or a whip, and it's very easy to go back and forth between the two. If you're interested, you'll have the option to use left handed weapons such as guns, torches, flame sprayers, etc.<br /><br />Enemies - Alright, here's where you'll definitely experience your first taste of adversity. No matter how weak some of the enemies may appear to be, they can easily kill you if you underestimate them. You may easily find yourself in a situation where you're getting close to the end of an area, and you're only moments away from the boss. You encounter an enemy type that you've beaten before, so you don't take him as seriously as you should, and a few combos later, you're dead. Why is this a problem? Unlike other games I've played, you'll have to replay the entire level because there are no checkpoints. If that's not adversity, I don't know what is. I don't necessarily agree with this practice, but it is what it is. The enemy variety is exceptional, and each area is guaranteed to introduce a new enemy type. If you enjoy a variety of bosses, it's very important to point out Bloodborne really delivers in that area. But of course, if a boss kills you, it's back to the drawing board, at the beginning of the level...<br /><br />Miscellaneous - Online gaming lovers will be pleased to know there is an online component. I didn't try it, so I really can't speak to it. I do know you can summon another player for help if you're struggling with a boss. Thereare no missions or sidemissions in Bloodborne, for the most part. I actually liked this because I felt freedom to do whatever I wanted, in no particular order. I also liked that there were very few cut-scenes because I'm somewhat annoyed by a ton of pointless cut-scenes. I didn't do as much exploring as I would have liked because the absence of a map can make that a little tricky. Speaking of exploration, there's really no collectables to speak of, and the only reason to explore would be to find hidden weapons, unlock area shortcuts (very important), and collect other game related items that I never used. Regarding game length, it took me 88 hours to get through my first playthrough. Granted, I died a ton and therefore I had to start from the beginning of the level, over and over.<br /><br />Look, this was a very difficult game for me to evaluate. While I liked it, I did not love it. Sure, I'm big enough to look past not being able to pause the game, lack of a map, cheap deaths, difficult learning curve, etc. However, I refuse to overlook being forced to start from the beginning of the level, when you die. For the people saying this is an old school type game; this formula can work well with less intense side-scrolling platformers, but NOT an action RPG! That makes the game more frustrating than hard. When a boss kills me, the first thing I want to do is give it another shot. With Bloodborne, (assuming you unlocked the short-cut) you'll have to wait on slow elevators, climb up ladders, and weave through several enemies, just to make it back to the boss and get your rematch. That's unnecessary and beyond ridiculous. Because of this (in addition to the other things I mentioned earlier in the paragraph), I was never really able to fall in love with Bloodborne.

Worked fine for about 2 months then they would constantly lock up.  You would no longer be able to adjust the volume or turn them off.  The only way it would fix itself was by the battery dying.  They would then work again for a little bit until they locked up again.  I had the latest firm ware and it appears I was far from the only one experiencing this problem.  I have better things to do than sending them back to the company waiting for them to fix them.  The sound itself was good but you would get occasional static from the cord.  So while my tb might not sound as good they don't have static, a cable, they are cheaper and don't lock up.  They need to make a more reliable product for the price.	2015-08-01

I'm not the biggest Zelda fan but I did enjoy this game, lots of enemies to fight and a decent amount of missions to do that through. It lacks a bit in the variety of enemies, especially bosses (I think there's 3 minus the characters that double as playable characters). They have it varied up well enough either way in missions that keeps things interesting, there's plenty of characters to use and they all have their own amusing moves. The art design with the characters is also well done, I like that they changed Link up and his origins, Impa looks awesome and is even more fun to play, etc etc, full marks.<br /><br />The bad side is this game ...pushes the WiiU beyond it's limits. While it does have a lot going on it also suffers with pop-in, especially when playing co-op where it's REALLY bad. I've run up to areas where the map says there's tons of enemies only for them to slowly spawn in right next to me in small groups. That said the game when played in co-op also lowers the resolution and graphical fidelity in an attempt  to keep all this fun action going but the framerate dips pretty hard at times and as stated the pop-in is really, really bad.<br /><br />That is by no means a killer for this game, it's just something that is worth noting. I think they would have been better off pulling the graphics back a bit, if only to make it run better and have less issue with the enemies popping in. The only other complaint is, it can be grindy if you're doing the adventure mode (I think that's what the mode is called), it's fun but they really have an odd way about letting you do quests...<br /><br />DLC NOTE: I'm not knocking the game itself for this, this is strictly about the DLC and does not hamper the game/review in anyway. There's DLC for this game, a lot of it, most of it's characters or skins and honestly the prices they're asking for are far too much. DLC can make a game more fun but when the price encroaches the cost of the game itself and it's not the same amount of content in the game, I get off put personally.<br />I'm sure it's well crafted but 20 bucks for some characters ...is not what I think is a great deal when the game offers far more for a better cost. There's some packs to save you money but honestly I cannot justify spending the money they're asking.<br />----<br /><br />Either way, it's a solid game on the WiiU that suffers from technical issues.	2015-08-01

I enjoy the sailing, but I felt it was a lot more fun in Black Flag than it was in Rogue for some reason, and I didn't waste time sailing as much as I did in the last game. I loved the fact that this game finally has gone back to no multiplayer options. Not having high speed internet or another person to play with I was actually able to complete all challenges and achievements finally. The challenges and achievements were fairly easy for the most part in this one. As with Black Flag, I hated the &#34;real world&#34; missions. They were pretty stupid and boring in here compared to the other games where you actually went out on real missions instead of hacking into random computers. My biggest disappointment is with the &#34;real world&#34; part of the story, otherwise I would have given this 5 stars. There really isn't much of a story there and you don't ever even see your guy's face or have a name. I sure miss Desmond's character!	2015-08-01

Alright I'll start by saying I'm new to the series with Rebirth 1 & 2 being games I found fun on PC, this game ...mixed bag for me personally.  I have no problem with hack and slash games, they can be some good fun but the problem is this game offers no variety in it's enemies, nor any form of challenge. I'm not asking for a game to be crushing, I'm asking this game to offer something other than punching bags that will rarely consider attacking. Unless you're under-leveled I don't think it's possible to lose a match in this, some will note a 1-3 hits can knock you out, I find it difficult to see enemies even attempt to strike.  The action itself is flashy and interesting to look at, each character has a neat variety of moves and skills you can throw in to change up the pace. You're expected to bring in 2 characters to each mission, this allows you to build a special gauge up faster and raise survivability- as well as raise your &#34;lily rank&#34; which helps characters fight together better.  The levels are very small for the most part, basically arenas that just cram in the enemies that spawn in in waves till you clear it. The only variety you'll find in the quests are the 'irregular quests' which are dumb, incredibly dumb. They do not tell you the objective, they just want you to either figure it out or exit the quest where they'll talk about it and give a very vague hint or two at what to do and that's it. These missions are also important since they give good equipment- the REAL kicker is if you do a quest that progresses the story you may entirely lose access to these missions even if you do a New Game+.  Here's my biggest gripe, I'm sure fans are okay with it but I just found it stupid. The fanservice, the clothes in this game get destroyed as you take hits, when it finally does you're 'treated' to a cutscene where you see the clothes get tattered. This would be worth a chuckle, I guess if half of them looked over 15 (yes, I know, they're Goddesses that are thousands of years old but they just LOOK like kids) two of them look like they're 8 or something and I personally have no interest in that kind of fanservice in general and have even less in seeing it happen to the younger ones. There an optional equipment bit to stop this from happening but you have to earn it with EVERY character and they punish you for using it since clothing-break is a game mechanic that when it happens it buffs your special gauge. It didn't stop me from equipping unbreakable clothes on everyone and still breezing through the game. ^ I don't care if fanservice is a theme of the series, I don't care that the dev made a similar game like this. It's something I'm not a fan of. I didn't know what to expect going in and while I'm not offended by this nor am I asking for censorship- I just didn't like the aspect of it. I'm anti-censorship so, don't assume I'm asking for anything.  The other issue is the game's assets are reused from the previous 2 games on the vita, the stages, character avatars, & enemies are ripped right out of the games entirely with no effort. As are many of the songs, maybe all of them.  It's flashy, it's mind-numbingly easy, I personally didn't care for the fan service. The game is mediocre, with the incredible amount of reused content & braindead AI the game feels weak. It isn't BAD, it's serviceable and I'm sure fans of the series will get a kick out of it.  The characters are amusing as they ever were (though it lacks IF, so I'm sad) but the story sadly doesn't carry the game well, the series always had a simple plot which is fine but this one is ...lacking. Either way I'm rambling again.   I would honestly look up a youtube video or two to get an idea of the game. I thought the game would get more challenging but it didn't, just very repetitive even for a hack and slash game like this, while mildly entertaining I don't know if even die-hard fans would get a kick out of it. It's not awful, there's nothing technically wrong with it gameplay wise, it's just very ...lazy I guess is the word for it.	2015-08-01

Gaming and 4k streams are superb. Although this is more expensive then most of the others out there, I've tried first, nexus player and I have the matricom G Q on the way.

This was genuinely a fun game that sits solidly within the survival horror genre so if you’re not prepared to die hundreds of times you might want to avoid this. (I died 169 times during my first play through) If you’re a fan of Shinji Mikami other games like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 4 there is a lot here that will feel familiar without feeling clich&eacute;d. The story is a bit convoluted and because I had to play it over several months I lost the plot line and had to double check online to remind myself what was happening.  The boss fights can be intense, but you’re never really without the supplies needed to defeat them. This fact can be both a good quality and a bit underwhelming as by the end you begin to feel increasingly like victory is certain and the game’s overall difficulty seems to diminish. All that being said, The Evil Within is actually very tense with some nice scares, a short learning curve, some very bizarre scenery, and a nice balance between difficulty and playability.<br /><br />PS. The Keeper was a thoroughly original monster. You’ll see what I mean.	2015-08-01

With games like Super Smash Bros., Splatoon, and Bayonetta 2, along with the whole Wii library, there's a good amount of games on the system.  The biggest part of the system is the controller itself, which is actually pretty light in weight and pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen on the controller is also not that bad, though most of the time, it's used as either an extension of the HUD (I guess you can say) or a second screen for if someone wants to watch a show on TV.  You want to be careful with this controller, though, as you can't just buy another tablet controller off the shelf, and there's probably no telling what a replacement one costs.  The console is also compatible with the original Wii accessories, with those accessories being used in Wii U games also, and games, making it the only console in the market available, at least before Microsoft brings the feature to the Xbox One via an update, to be backwards compatible.  I highly recommend this console for someone who is a fan of Nintendo games, though it is available for at least $200 on Nintendo's online store, which is where I got mine.  It also makes a great secondary console alongside the PS4, Xbox One, or PC.	2015-08-01

The reason for this is because of the technology used in the charger is designed for and compatible only with the Sony batteries in the ps4 controllers and the not the batteries in the apple products. So the charger can tell when the Sony battery is fully charged and turn to green but when another type of battery is being charged it can not tell so it may remain red.<br /><br />Personally:<br /> I had such a problem with leaving my $60 &#34;Sony DualShock 4 Wireless Controller for PlayStation 4&#34; anywhere, losing it quickly, requiring me to purchase another controller (in a different colour so I'd know which one was lost) for back up to have charged and potentially not misplaced. That didn't help my disorganized habit. I had the opportunity to request this for evaluation and review and I'm so happy that it was provided to me by TNT Interactive because now the controllers are always in the cradle if not in use. It wasnt a hard habit to break because the ease of knowing where my controller was and knowing that it was charged made my PS4 experience a lot smoother when dealing with Netflix asking if I'm still watching something, So much so that I wish I had two. One for my bedside and one next to my console.	2015-08-01

This game is awesome and there is just no other way to put it. The only thing bad about the game would probably be how annoying blobs are. But that just makes it much more challenging. Gas Meaver is my personal favorite monster in the game. It can both paralyze and poison enemy monsters, and with it's high stats, it is nearly impossible to get rid of. If you want to get a new game, get this one. You will not regret it.	2015-08-01

[UPDATE] I ended up turning my warranty repair into my credit card company.  They paid for the repair.  I would never purchase another console without an extended warranty on top of paying with a credit card with an additional buyer protection plan. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If it works then it's a good console experience, not great, but good.  The problem is the build quality is really poor. When you contact support they will dismiss your issues or tell you they will push a software update to fix it. But when they don't they will continue to deny the issue or keep promising future software fixes. Then after your hardware warranty expires they immediately give you the &#34;option&#34; to send it in for repair at a cost of about $125. But if you go online to process you'll save $10.  It's very clear MS has no intentions on honoring their warranty or dealing with legitimate returns.  When you are able to play games it's a good console. Interface is improving and game selection is the best imo.  It's just a roll of the dice if you're getting good hardware or not. If you don't...it's a nightmare.	2015-08-01

Graphics are great and definitely seem to take advantage of the next-gen AMD hardware that modern consoles come with.  It rivals PC graphics on several games in my opinion, and I come from a long life of gaming across almost every platform imaginable.<br /><br />Attention, Parents!<br />It is rated M.  Don't take that lightly.  Games like Call of Duty are, but they are nothing in comparison.  This game uses the &#34;f- bomb&#34; almost constantly.  The violence is very graphic.  I love the game but do not advise it for anyone younger.	2015-08-01

They act like it's not in ANY other telltale game. The truth telltale is horrible with patching the glitches an lags, but all in all, there were not as many lags as everyone says. The game story is really good, along with a ending that really kinda ruined for me, hinting to a second season, which it really didn't need. It made no sense, like a twist ending they were going for, but when you look deep down, there's no logical reasons for it. The game just put it in to be true. Besides that, great story, fun fight sequences (my favorite fight sequences are in telltales games) actually really good story few the first couple episodes until ep 5. (Btw, it's not even confirmed that there will be a sequel, so If there isn't one, it would really destroy there ending. Trust me, when you get to it and see it, you'll see that it made no sense) other than that, great game. I have all the episodes downloaded on my Xbox, if the disc gives you too much trouble, get it off your own device and dowlonaed the season pass for 15 dollars. You save the price of a whole episode. Hope this review was hepul.	2015-08-01

[[VIDEOID:9426bb6c9792eb00b2e2c4e77b8ad07b]] Hello Amazon!<br /><br />Just want it to be noted that I received a free sample for this review, and it has not affected the review, and the video is actually just a microphone test with some stock photography over it.<br /><br />STEP 1. AUDIO QUALITY<br />The audio quality sounds great on this headset. I could real feel a thud when the bass struck, and the highs and lows sounds great too. The volume can go high enough to almost hurt your ears, and at max when you take the headset off, you can hear it from up to 5 feet away. I'm no audiophile, but I have listened to and owned some high quality headphones, and the sound ranks right up there near them. (Test Music - Turn Down For What - DJ Snake)<br /><br />STEP 2. BUILD QUALITY<br />Right out of the box, these headphones look great. The build is a shiny plastic, with leather pads on the headband and ears. The padding on the ears is big enough to go all the way over my ears, so I can wear them for a long time, but not too big to be uncomfortable. The USB is the only thing off about this, as it is only used for the LED on the sides of the ears. The LED is not too bright, and is mainly used for the effect.This headset is big, no doubt about it. My estimate for fitting age is possible 12 - adult, so they are great for everyone.<br /><br />STEP 3. MICROPHONE QUALITY<br />The microphone quality review is listed in the video, so the only thing I want to point out here is that there is a faint buzzing / feedback in the audio. Other than that, it is good.<br /><br />Thank you for listening, and reading my review! If this was helpful to you, hit that little thumbs up button below.	2015-08-01

Play, Pause, Skip - all missing.<br /><br />I have heard that the Amazon Fire TV Stick remote works - I have one of those as well as the regular Fire TV remote. I have yet to give them a try, but if either of them do in fact work I would go that route. You'd be losing the voice search, but you don't use that while you watch media.	2015-08-01

The case snapped nicely into place and keeps my 3DS from getting scratched or covered with fingerprints. The case is made of clear plastic and is thin enough where it won't add too much bulk to the 3DS itself, but can still protect it from minor bumps and drops. The cutouts on the case are well made and don't interfere with any of the ports or cameras. It is slightly difficult to attach and remove the back half of the case, but I have no problem with this, since it means it won't be coming off accidentally. This case does a great job of keeping my 3DS nice and clean and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a case to showcase their 3DS without breaking the bank. Its true that this case probably wouldn't stand up to being tossed around, but if you plan to handle your game that way, you might as well get a nerf case.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a great case at an unbeatable price and will keep your 3DS protected under regular use.	2015-08-01

But the biggest flaw is inability to use TWO Move sticks :( Honestly, I felt so out of balance and whatever, that I just held both sticks while cycling or rowing, even if the second one did not actually interact with the Move's Eye. If you guys are going to make Motionsports 2, PLEASE at least include an option to use not just one, but two sticks. You know, for us - the ignorant majority with two hands...	2015-08-01
