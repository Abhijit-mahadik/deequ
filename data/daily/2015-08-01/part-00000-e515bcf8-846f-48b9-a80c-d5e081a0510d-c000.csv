I have very oily skin. Mostly in my t-zone area. But since I've popped open my Aztec Clay, no more oily skin and no more enlarged pores!!! It is hands down the best product I've EVER purchased for my face. And it is soooo much product as well. It will last me forever. If you use it with apple cider vinegar, it kicks it up a notch (doesn't smell great) but gets the job done! I also heard this does wonders on your natural hair, but I haven't tried it yet!	2015-08-01

I gave it four stars because it does tend to fade at the roots but as they grow and get more applications they take the color better.  That was a bit confusing but you will still get fade-out at the new roots and just above.  It does not get brassy like most browns and the color is subtle enough to look natural.  It is ammonia free and does not damage my hair as much as permanent colors.  And it is predictable, which frankly, my hairdressers were not which is why I switched to home coloring.	2015-08-01

I purchase the Styleaway in white to try to become more organized and less strung out with my hair devices and products.  The neat thing about this organizer is that it has a bar on the back so you can hang it allowing for easy access.  This organizer measures about 10&#34;L x 9&#34;W x 8&#34;H (to the bar).  I have mine filled with a hair dryer, a Chi flat iron, a Beachwaver, a couple of brushes and combs, and some hair products.  It does make it quite heavy though so take that into consideration while hanging.  Overall the Styleaway has helped me become more organized and my husband really appreciates it.  :)	2015-08-01

Very disappointed.  Have tried the product on myself and my three year old daughter.  Most importantly, not effective at preventing sunburn, which both my daughter and I experienced after just a short time in the sun.  Tried the product on three separate occasions not thinking that the product could be the issue, but each time experienced far more sun damage than should have occurred considering the time of exposure.  On another note, the product is indeed very greasy.  Simply covering my daughters neck, forehead and ears with the sunscreen resulted in incredibly greasy hair.  Love the idea of the Honest Company, and bought the product based on name brand alone, but product really failed to meet my basic expectations of what a sunscreen should do.	2015-08-01

I love everything about the Brow Wiz from the color (soft brown is great for dark blonde, light-med brown or highlighted hair) to the ease at which it rolls on.....it's not a pen, but not a pencil consistency.  It's a perfect, in the middle tool, that gives you the ease and glide of a pen, but not the harshness.

Simply wet the crystal under running water for just a tad and roll it under armpit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No fragrance.<br />Goes on clear.<br />Really does control odor.<br />Does not contain parabens or aluminum.<br />Does not stain clothes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you have a tendency to perspire heavily, this product won't work for you.<br />If you have a tendency towards developing strong body odors this product may not work for you.<br />If you drop the crystal it will separate from the base and you will struggle to use it.<br />This particular size stick doesn't travel well. I need to find a smaller one for my travels.<br /><br />Will I use this product again? Yes this will continue to be my product of choice.<br /><br />Who should use this product? This product works for people who do not perspire heavily and who are seeking alternatives to deodorant.	2015-08-01

This one here, though, is legitimate, and I'm in love with it. I have fine, wavy, below shoulder length hair that I blow dry straight. One pump of this fabulous product and my hair is left soft, smooth, conditioned, and full of body, with a glorious scent. I have hair that curls and frizzes at the slightest humidity, and this cream helps resist that annoying tendency. Use sparingly -- more than a pump or two will give you a greasy result. Work from the ends up - you don't need to saturate your roots. A truly wonderful hair product!	2015-08-01

I have used it every morning and every night since I got it. After seven uses, I am noticing a difference in the texture of my skin on my neck. I lost a lot of weight recently and I was getting a case of crinkle neck, if you will. However, this product seems to be helping my skin bounce back, so to speak. I got this product at a discount for my honest review. Honestly, this is working for me. I cannot guarantee it will work for everyone, nor can I guarantee others will see results in three or four days like I did. As far as I'm concerned, this is a great product.  It doesn't take much to work and it doesn't have an unpleasant scent. It's not really scented as far as I can tell, so it doesn't interfere with my cologne.	2015-08-01

My husband and I have been using this product for years when we color our hair at home.  It helps hold the semi-permanent color longer and keeps it from fading before the next coloring.  Somehow this product allows the dye to penetrate the gray hair better and it really retains the color.  The drops are a dark brown color tending toward a red hue but it doesn't make your hair red or even have a reddish tint when finished.  I use an auburn dye and my husband a medium brown dye and the color is not altered by these drops.  I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for something to keep your color from fading so quickly.	2015-08-01

Thinking of buying 2 more as gifts.<br /><br />I'm a guy so my only complaint is my only color choice was pink.  I'm gay so pink is fine, but suppose it depends on the buyer😃.

I don't know if it keeps me protected more than other products because I have used only Clinique products for years.  My dermatologist said Clinique is one of the good ones.

Never apply to eye or above cheeks or forehead.	Been using this and the 70 strength both for 3 or more years now. Bought this double set to give a friend who's shy about using any sun screen (she thinks they all make her HOT and STICKY) Anyway the sun screen is good if not pretty good. Not great. I like it comes in two strengths. I do not see much difference between this one and the 100 strength for the face but that does not mention it is COOL Misting. I use all three pretty much the same. To put any on my face I spray into my hand and then pat onto my face. I never use any sun screen these included direction on my face or around my eyes or on my forehead. Almost always this causes extreme eye issues if you sweat at all or it gets into the eyes during putting it on. (Try almost any good lip balm with sunscreen at 30-50 and apply to the eye area including yes...right on over the eye lids and all around and OMG you can protect your eyes/skin that is...without pain. I've been applying sunscreen to my eyes for over 30 years now this way when a lip balm came out by Aloe years ago. This is no longer made for about a decade I believe. But I tracked them down even when they moved from Florida up the coast but no longer need to....I do advise finding lip balms unscented no fruity smells etc let alone no taste. It's for your eyes.) Back to these...over all I find this one lasts over a decent amount of time...biking/hiking/even winter sports and apply 2 rarely more than 4 times for a full day in the sun. However..if in and out of water or rain even you may find you need to apply a lot more. It seems to last pretty good..it is not hot...cooling however is subjective to user. I do not find it is a cooling mist. Thus one star down. But it is a good adequate sun screen and also easy to share a spray can with others...like it much better than any lotion out there. PS if you do not have help to put on back or hard to reach areas....the spray can....does allow you to spritz those areas though not as nicely done as if you could spread it on with hands...which I still prefer to do..spray into palm and then spread onto skin to protect. Which reminds me...love to put this on tops of my hands which are often exposed no matter what I'm up to for the day in the sun. (Would be nice to see a couple dollars lowered price...bet they would sell twice as much if they did too.)read it on with hands...which I still prefer to do..spray into palm and then spread onto skin to protect.

By far one of the worst products I've ever reviewed. Made in China, the manufacturer has achieved a new low in cheap products. The cotton tips have barely any cotton on them, way less than you find on American Q Tips. Some sticks even have ZERO cotton on an end, only a few strands. The low cotton volume means harsh swabbing when using to clean the ear canal. The wooden sticks themselves are thinner than a tooth pick and completely irregular, some breaking off when using, others coming out of the box already broken. Absolutely NOT worth buying, NO MATTER HOW CHEAP THEY ARE ADVERTISED.	2015-08-01

I have been getting a lot of whiteheads lately under my chin so I bought this type that also contained the face strips. The face strips did not do a great job at removing my white heads under my chin. As far as the nose strips, when I first used these the nose strips from my first box, they were able to pull out a whole lot of whiteheads from my nose. However now that I use it, it does not do a great job. Probably you will need to have a whole lot of blackheads and whiteheads on your nose for the nose strip to actually pull anything  out.

I mainly use it to fight acne in 2 different ways.<br /><br />1. I create a face mask that I rinse off later on while bathing in the tub. I use a small ceramic bowl, add about a tablespoon of the powder and slowly add small amounts of water while stirring. This will prevent the clay from clunking up. I prefer a thicker mask so I add just enough water to create the mask. Then I place it all over my face and neck. If I have extra I place it on my upper chest. You will immediately begin to feel tingling. Your face will then begin to tighten as the clay mask begins to dry. You may even feel your face pulsating. I draw a bath in the meantime. Once I am done with my bath or when the tightness is too much for me, I remove the mask with a washcloth. Simply wet the washcloth with water and pat on the mask to moisten. Then go over again in circular motions until mask is removed. You will have to give your bath an extra rinse since the clay may stick to the tub.<br /><br />2. I also use the clay for problem areas. Since I too tend to have cystic acne, I immediately mix a small amount of the clay/water and place on the problem area. The clay will reduce the inflammation caused by acne. Sometimes I leave on overnight. I have seen other people suggest mixing the clay with apple cider vinegar so as to prevent harming the skin. So far I have not had any problems. Will try the ACV.<br /><br />This product is affordable and less expensive than all the other acne treatment products I've purchased in the past.	2015-08-01

Good close shave and great battery life. Unfortunately, the foil is very thin when compared to higher end shavers and damages very easily.

In the long run, you may end up paying the price of a higher end shaver to keep this one running.	2015-08-01

As a regular tester, I've arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!<br />~ Fragrance: Lotiony. None added.<br />~ Feel during application: Smooth, like a light moisture lotion. Cream is light yellow.<br />~ Feel after absorption: Smooth, almost powdery, moisturized, no unpleasant film.<br />~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Probably okay for all.<br />~ Is it tested on animals?: No.<br />~ Packaging: 4oz plastic wide mouth jar with screw on lid.<br />~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* It leaves skin nice and soft.<br />~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* I’m not sold on the idea that a skin cream can treat subdermal fat. But you can make skin tighter and firmer and better conditioned so as to hide the cellulite. This cream might help do that with its retinol and caffeine, and it’s got enough stuff that’s nice for the skin like shea butter, allantoin, aloe and oils that it’d be worth using even if it didn’t help your cellulite.<br /><br />*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don't when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it's more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.	2015-08-01

Beauty	4	0	0	N	N	Can be used by men and women, adults or teens	I have had the pleasure of reviewing several items in the Oz Naturals skin care line and found them all pleasant to use, non-irritating, and they seem to deliver on natural methods of caring for one's skin.<br /><br />The Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer is a different looking and feeling moisturizer. First of all it is a tan color which differs from usual moisturizers. It has a scent that seems out-doorsy, natural, and different. It has taken a bit of adjustment to me, personally, since this is so different. The moisturizer is a liquid/cream (meaning not quite as stiff as many moisturizers). I can easily over-dispense the product onto my hand, so I am careful. It doesn't take much to cover my face, neck, and chest area.<br /><br />I cleanse my face, apply serum, and then apply the Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer. It is important to wait for each product you apply to dry before applying the next. This is true, too, if you wish to apply makeup after your skin care routine. Makeup goes on very well and lasts well during the day when using the Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer.<br /><br />I can see this product being used by men and women, adults or teens.<br /><br />The price is certainly affordable at roughly $25 per tube and will last quite awhile. I can recommend this for those who wish to have a natural moisturizer.<br /><br /> OZ NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE CRUELTY FREE & FIGHT ANIMAL CRUELTY<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.

Anyway, after a long strew of buying incorrect colors, but trying to make it work anyway, I came across this on their site. It had a test to see what is best for you. It was so dead on, I was so surprised.  Others had tests, but didn't work. This feels like you have no makeup on, and doesn't look cakey or anything - just that you have smooth, unblemished skin!

I had never used a primer before, so I didn't really understand the difference it makes, but after reading about them I figured I'd try it. It was love at first application. First of all, all you need is a *tiny* dab (a little goes a LONG way!), and a small amount easily spreads over your whole face. It's white in the tub but comes out completely transparent on my face. The consistency of this is the best part; it feels like rubbing pure silky goodness into your face. And it makes my makeup last all day long without having to reapply. I'll never be without this stuff. The only complaint I have is the price for such a teeny little container. But since you don't need much in a single application, one of these has lasted me a long time.	2015-08-01

The Arcitec shaver still works, still takes a charge and still provides a pretty good shave. However, the blades are getting a bit dull and the Arcitec itself was getting close to 8 years old.<br /><br />While looking for a new shaving head, I found that the design had been changed and that many people were not happy with the change. Shave heads with the original design were selling for almost $200.<br /><br />I decided rather than to buy a new and maybe not so good replacement head for the 8 year old Arcitec that I would look for a different shaver.<br /><br />I found the Panasonic ES-LF51-A Arc 4 wet or dry electric shaver. The reviews were mostly good and the total cost was about twice that of new design replacement heads for my Phillips Arcitec shaver. So, new shaver, new shaving head at a relatively low cost – did not seem too bad so I ordered one from Amazon.<br /><br />First impressions were that it had a good solid feel and finish. The rubberized portions of the shaver body provide for a solid grip and were a nice addition.<br /><br />The shaving head can be locked into  position or can be set to articulate as you shave.<br /><br />I plugged it in to charge the battery before I started it. Charging took about an hour. The shaver has LED’s that indicate the level of charge.<br /><br />On starting the shaver, I noticed that it operated with a high frequency buzz. This was not a surprise since the description from the manufacturer says that it operates at 14,000 RPM.<br /><br />The high frequency buzz is especially noticeable when the shaver is close to the ear. Fortunately, time spent with the shaver close to the ear is minimal in most cases so the noise is not a big problem.<br /><br />I tried it on my beard but could not do a good test since I had shaved that morning with a blade. I decided to allow my beard to grow for a couple of days so that I could do a fair test.<br /><br />A couple dayslater, I tried the shaver again. The first thing I noticed was that the Panasonic seems to be a “linear” shaver. By “linear” I mean that I found that I was more or less required to shave using parallel strokes. I had been shaving with a rotary shaver for the past eight years so became accustomed to using a circular shaving pattern. When I tried using a circular shaving pattern with the Panasonic, it just did not feel right.<br /><br />I know that Panasonic says that one should use the shaver for 30 days before making a judgment but it seemed that the parallel shaving pattern caused me to miss places. I changed the direction of the parallel strokes to be sure to catch all of my beard. I used the shaver for two weeks before making the decision to return it<br /><br />The quality of the shave is good. There were only a few places (as with the Arcitec) where I had to repeatedly make passes to remove the stubble.<br /><br />Instructions say to apply liquid soap to the shaver head and enter cleaning mode on the shaver to clean it. To enter cleaning mode, hold the power button in for a couple of seconds. The shaver goes into really high frequency operation on a timer. Once cleaning mode has finished, the shaver turns off. The heads can then be rinsed with cold water and you are ready to go again.<br /><br />The Panasonic is a wet or dry shaver but I never used it as a wet shaver. I think that as long as I am going to put shaving cream on my face, I might as well use a blade. A fresh blade provides a better shave than any electric shaver I have ever used.<br /><br />I guess that I could have tried the Panasonic while in the shower but then I would need a mirror.<br /><br />Shaving without a mirror is OK for a “rough in” shave that might be adequate for weekends but if one is going to work or on a date then a mirror is required to be sure that sideburns are trimmed neatly and that no paces have been missed.<br /><br />Having a mirror in the shower is problematicbecause it gets steamed up or wet so that details are hard to see. Besides, how much time can one afford to spend in the shower?<br /><br />I did not use the trimmer on the Panasonic and I do not use the trimmer on my Arcitec.<br /><br />I figure that I have to go into the bathroom eventually so while there, I trim sideburns with a blade – much more accurate. Using a blade allows for a “surgical” trim because the blade does not obstruct my view of where I want to trim and it is light in weight and easier – in my opinion – to manipulate than a shaver.<br /><br />If you ever go to a “real” old time barber, they will trim your sideburns, neck and hairline with a straight razor and not clippers. Having a razor sharp blade in the hands of a relative stranger so close to your carotid artery provides for a bit of apprehension but it adds to the over all barber experience.<br /><br />I am retired now but when I worked each day, I used the electric shaver as part of morning preparation multitasking. With an electric shaver, I could shave while checking the news, weather or traffic on TV and while having morning coffee.<br /><br />Additionally, with a shaver that allows a circular shaving pattern, shaving can be a more or less absent minded procedure that is not available if I need to pay attention to the direction of parallel shaving strokes and checking for missed spots.<br /><br />As a final test before I decided to return the Panasonic, I shaved and then took notice of the quality of the shave with the Panasonic. I waited a couple of days for my beard to grow again and then shaved with the 8 year old Arcitec with the year old shaving head and again took notice of the quality of the shave.<br /><br />The comparison of shave quality between the Panasonic and Arcitec did not show enough difference in to warrant keeping the Panasonic shaver with its parallel shaving requirement.<br /><br />Bottom line: The Panasonic shaver provides a very close shave. However,the fact that it is in my opinion a parallel device causes it not to be acceptable for my purposes.	2015-08-01

It takes a lot of work to plump and lengthen my lashes. No matter what mascara or expensive eyelash curler I bought--the results were so-so. I have pulled my lashes out accidentally on a few occasions, leaving sparse patches on my lid. Instead of going for eyelashes extension, I decided to invest and experiment with a treatment, and debated between Revitalash and Latisse. Both had great reviews, and although Latisse seems to have a stronger formula--the perk of not needing a prescription led me to try Revitalash first. Most reviews said they saw results in 3 months. I have to say: I noticed big results in just two! My sparse spots filled in and my lashes are longer and stronger. It's nothing I so much noticed with bare lashes, but once I put mascara on--there was a world of difference from before. Can't wait to see the full results in another 4 months. Highly recommend. Word of advice: be patient, use every night, and be realistic with your expectations.	2015-08-01

I understood that there might be more than one color when I ordered this from Amazon but the finish was not as noted on the site nor on the box it arrived in. It is shiny, slippery, hard metallic-colored plastic, not rubberized like the box notes and like the first one I ordered through Amazon. Hopefully it will perform the same, but the finish was disappointing and isn't comfortable. Check your local Bed, Bath & Beyond to get the brush you want and use a coupon. That's what I'll do if I want another.	2015-08-01

I'm posting this review on the day I received the product which was the 1st day of the estimated delivery time period. I attached this product to an order with other products so that i can use the free shipping service from amazon (for elligible orders above 35$) and it actually arrived first before anything else.<br />1. This little product is like a silicon washboard for make-up brushes and sponges. I generally use warm to hot water and soft soap to clean off my brushes so as to kill germs and remove leftovers from makeup products. The material of the silicon finger glove is thick enough yet still flexible so that it wasn't affected at all after I tested for the first time by letting hot water run over it for several minutes. Major plus, since i didn't want to end up with a product going gummy soft under high temperature due to thin structure.<br />2. The size of this product allowed me to hold it by one finger (there's not much room for two unless you have really small fingers) when cleaning my brushes, while supporting it with the rest of my fingers. But I could also skip that and just hold it in my palm. Overall, it's medium size, easy, has the shape of half an egg and quite comfortable to use.<br />3. I used the ridges of the product for cleaning make-up brushes and sponges while running them softly perpendicular to the ridges, and the little dots at the end for eye-shadow brushes. Honestly, the shape offers quite some flexibility with what you want to clean depending on the size of the brush. I liked though that it has those little dots at the end, since they helped me clean thoroughly smaller brushes and make sure that the hairs were free of product. Also, the dots/ridges of the silicon glove helps building a lather with soap a lot easier, and like any washboard don't expect it to clean your brushes for you, it only serves as a very nifty surface while you do the work.<br />4. Most importantly, at least for me, I noticed the price. I compared it to other similar products of the same material, shape and function and the one by Hotrose pulls ahead. It's only 4.99 $ (currently, at the time of the review) compared to more expensive ones, and as I mentioned in the beginning I ordered it among other products and chose the free shipping service from amazon.com, since this little product is actually elligible for the free shipping service from amazon.com when other similar ones are not, adding quite the cost on such a small simple cleaning product. It arrived fast, in perfect condition and didn't have to pay shipping fees. Overall, very satisfied with seller, price and quality.ce.

It’s easy to sit and say we shouldn’t place so much importance on certain aspects of looking pretty or handsome.<br /><br /> I started to lose my hair and I always said I wouldn’t care, but the little digs and loss of respect from people really affected me.<br /><br /> I was at a cliff—should I just shave it all off or I could try to go in for treatments to regrow my hair?<br /><br /> Well I know if I shave it all off I’ll look like a cue ball so I go for the other option.<br /><br />NuNutrients luckily works after a few weeks (what a few weeks though!<br /><br />Whew!) and I am glad I don’t have to shave my head and endure ridicule from my friends and family.<br /><br /> I still don’t agree that we should place that much importance on hair but words hurt and for now I am happy.	2015-08-01

I could really like this product, except I should probably have gotten a darker shade. I bought this for the first time a couple of weeks ago (at a local drug store) because I'm having trouble with dark circles under my eyes and haven't really found anything that solves that problem in a way that I'm totally satisfied with yet. This is the best thing I've tried so far. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I found that the different colors were not at all just on the surface but (so far) seem to completely permeate the compact. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of pigment to the green & pink, but I am tempted to chalk that up to the fact that this one is simply too light for me, and if I don't find that this issue as well as the one of generally too-faint coverage (which makes occasional touch-ups an absolute necessity) are resolved by buying a deeper shade of this product, I will include that & any other pertinent info in an update.<br /><br />I am using this product even though it is much too light for me, it does seem to blend pretty well with another powder I have that is somewhat too dark and has a tendency to look too &#34;heavy.&#34; So, in my case, two of my makeup purchasing mistakes seem to be cancelling each other out with pretty good results LOL ;)<br /><br />I absolutely do plan on purchasing this product again, only in the next darker shade.I am very fair and I normally purchase either the very lightest, or next to the very lightest shade of powders and concealers. However, from what I can see, this product is probably going to be pretty much useless for anyone but those ladies who are very, very advanced in beauty (as only ladies over about 70 or so years old have been able to achieve.) I tried it on a friend of mine who, if nekkid, could lean up against a freshly painted eggshell whilte wall and blend right in if she wasn't also a flaming ginger. Amazinly, this stuff was a bit too light for her as well.<br />Then, I tried it on my gorgeous 83 year old neighbor and viola! Perfection! It looked so good on her I thought I might not get it back from her, good thing she is a drinker and somewhat forgetful hahaha!<br /><br />No one who has not had at least 70 years on this earth in which to become an expert level genius in beauty is lovely and fair enough to wear the lightest shade of this product, so even if you are Irish or just extremely pasty for some other reason, you still really need to get a darker shade if you don't want to appear even more ghoulish than you already do all by yourself. Also, I have noticed that this product seems to look and cover best when applied with a large powder or &#34;kabuki&#34; brush (how appropriate, amirite?) than it does when applied with the dumb little flat brush that comes with it or a powder puff. For precision appplication and coverage, such as under the eyes, use a medium-soft or a medium bristle eyeshadow brush (a really soft brush just gets it everywhere but where you want it and is an exercise in frustration more than anything else.)ear old neighbor and viola!

Beauty	5	1	2	N	N	Another awesome carrier oil for your essential oil collection!	As an avid user of essential oils, I'm always on the lookout for new oils/carrier oils so I can mix up new concoctions. I don't ever use carrier oils in the diffuser, but I do use them to mix up face washes, hair conditioners, moisturizers, etc.<br /><br />I've been using this oil mixed with jojoba for hair conditioner and I gotta say it has made my hair look super healthy and has made it very soft. I've also heard its very good for skin aliments so the next time I get an acne breakout I will definitely be giving it a try.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a really great carrier oil. My go to is usually coconut oil but I actually like this better because it has almost no scent and I believe it feels a little less greasy but that might just be me.<br /><br />Plant Therapy had some overstock of this Evening Primrose oil and agreed to give me a discount if I would test it out and leave a review. Having said that, I take reviews seriously and I'm under no obligation to leave a good review. The opinions above are my own and my honest opinion is that this is a fantastic carrier oil for anyones essential oil collection!	2015-08-01

So I've been in the market for cheap replacement brushes for over a year. I've been trying to find an affordable replacement for sonicare  brush heads, which seem to be quite expensive. Most of the reviews of other products I've seen are usually stating how low quality those brush heads are!<br /><br />These brush heads, on the contrary, are fantastic! First and foremost, they are much cheaper than the official sonicare, at about half the cost (if not a little less). They also seem to work as well as the real product, if not a little better. In fact, after putting this brush head on, it made a weird sound coming from my tooth brush (with the old head) stop. It also seems to use high quality materials, as the brush heads feel nice and there is a metal ring where the brush head contacts the handle. I honestly can't tell the difference from the officially branded brush heads!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-much cheaper<br />-works well<br />-high quality materials<br /><br />Cons:<br />-not the official product	2015-08-01

I thought it would be a good choice for the family, as we were going to the beach for a few hours. Prior to this experience, I've never had sunburn, I'm fairly dark olive complected, but still take the proper precautions when out in the sun. The three of us re-applied each hour on the hour. Everyone was horribly burned, including myself. My sunburn was bad enough that it actually swelled, and I went to the doctor for treatment. My spouse had sunburn all over his face, arms and sides, and his father did as well. I will surely never purchase this product again, and never recommend it. I'm steering clear of this brand's sun care entirely.	2015-08-01

My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong fragrances.<br /><br />I replaced deodorant with a crystal body deodorant stick which works for me. This summer I decided to use this Tom's of Maine Deodorant because it is also an antiperspirant. This is something my crystal stick doesn't offer. I solely intend to use it for hot days when I may perspire the most.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It does control my perspiration which is what I wanted.<br />The natural powder fragrance is nice since more fragrances annoy me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Will stain dark clothes with a white residue like most deodorants.<br />One has to scrub harder to remove the deodorant from the armpit.<br /><br />Will I use this product again? Yes but only during the hottest months of the year. I plan on returning to my crystal deodorant that still keeps odors away. I don't mind light perspiration since I think it's healthy for the body. I'm glad I tried this product. It's an option.<br /><br />Who should use this product? Well it depends on your needs and issues with deodorants.	2015-08-01

All my other wrinkles	I just received my peel last night and used it straight away. I was a tiny bit nervous since this is my first peel ever. I followed the directions with cleansing and using the alcohol to prep. And then I applied the glycolic with a cotton ball. It stung but really hardly at all. I was able to leave it on for a full 3 minutes and could have gone longer but didn't want to push it for my first time. I rinsed with the baking soda/water solution and then warm water. My skin only got a little red and that quickly dissipated. Right away it felt extra smooth and soft. I slathered my face with coconut oil after. This morning I already noticed that the crepiness under my eyes has slightly improved which is WONDERFUL. All my other wrinkles look the same so far - I'm 51 so there's a lot. But I think if I continue this every week I will see other improvements.	2015-08-01

The recommendation on the package is to wear these only for 4-6 hours or less. I wore once for 5 hours and had no issue taking off; wore another time over night (probably a total 13-14 hours) and it was a little more adhered to me, but not hard to take off. Of course every body is different, and would follow the company's recommendation first.<br />I also felt no residue left on me.<br />I do have sensitive skin, even around my areola I get zits and have dry skin - and this product did not cause me to have any reaction.<br />I am a C cup - never pregnant - and almost 30 (breast still perky). I don't mind my ladies being free, but my nipples are almost always hard, so going bra-less in sheer tops feel uncomfortable. Though this product did not conceal my h.n. 100%, it was 75% better than being fully free.<br />To me, the product is too pricey for 5 pairs; so I won't be buying these often and only use when I really need to be conservative for outfits that don't look right with bras.	2015-08-01

I've used this for several years and like that it applies on my skin without leaving any sticky residue, shine, or smell. My qualm with it is that the product flakes or precipitates out as a solid if I'm sweating a lot (e.g. on long hikes). Or maybe it's the humidity. I'm not 100% sure what the cause is.

I have thick (very thick) hair, and so I probably used a bit more at a time than what most other people would need. For its stated purpose of mending split ends, I can't say that I've gotten any good results (at least not noticeably so).

While those do work, I really enjoyed this new product. It includes a toothpaste and a whitening gel and it only  takes a total of two minutes to apply! One minute to brush your teeth with the toothpaste and one minute to brush on the whitening gel, rinse and you're done! As a coffee fanatic and a Mother of three kids, getting to the dentist for a cleaning would be a vacation, I need to keep teeth whitening a priority. This quick and easy method of the Crest 3D white power duo works very well for me! #Crest #Gotitfree	2015-08-01

I was going on a summer vacation and I wanted some quick and inexpensive highlights. I'd just had grow my hair out to the length that I wanted so I didn't want to go get another color and cut just to cover up my gray roots.  I used a box of this on my normally dark brown hair and was very impressed with the reddish brown highlights and the gray coverage. I'll probably do it again one more time before the summer ends and they go back to my darker fall and winter haircolor.  Great value! This saved me at least $100 at the hair salon!	2015-08-01

And the plus side to it being thin is I can wear it out and about in hot days and not feel like I'm going to croak from heat exhaustion. If this is your first time wig, I suggest wearing a little cap with it, and carry a brush with you because this is a very brushable wig. Thanks for a great product!	2015-08-01

It does remind me of a rainy afternoon although I don't know why...rain never smells like this.  So, I'm not sure how the manufacturer was able to accomplish such an olfactory sense of a rainy day.  Regardless, it is a very light scent and perfect for a night on the boardwalk at the beach...or a day at the office as it shouldn't be very noticeable to coworkers with a scent-sensitivity.	2015-08-01

I received the free sample from the main website, and I thought... heck it was free so I would give it a try.  I've tried everything, and nothing worked.  This doesn't grow your hair but it makes it appears darker and thicker.  I've been told by many people that it doesn't look like I'm balding at all.  Keep in mind I have a VERY noticeable bald spot on the back of my head with a FEW strands of hair.  It's about 2 1/2 inches around.  Also i use it in the front of my hair, as there is an almost semi circle that I cover up with this as well.  The only thing I have to do is after I put it on, I spray everything with hair spray and it stays all day long.  You can even touch it with your hands and nothing comes off.  I don't use it everyday, I usually wear a hat, but sometimes when I can't and have to wear a suit that is when I use it.  This way it lasts longer.	2015-08-01

It does a great job at moisturizing especially during the winter months. However it has a very strong sickening sweet scent to it. So if you're the type of person who's sensitive to those types of scents you might not want to buy it. I myself will continue to purchase this despite the scent because it is one of the best moisturizers I've ever tried.  I use it on my entire body except my face. It doesn't cause any irritations whatsoever. Overall I would definitely recommend this to someone who's looking for a great moisturizer and isn't sensitive to sweet scents.	2015-08-01

Very happy with this product, it's a very high quality product.  Well balanced and it gives a very nice shave.  I've tried feather blades in other razors and really couldn't use them without discomfort and nicks, however in this razor it's a perfect match.  Like all double edge razors, you need to use good technique to get the closest shave but on a day to day basis, it's easy to use, produces a comfortable shave, and the blades are a very reasonable price (I purchased 50 for $25).

I am now paying way too much money to buy up whatever is left in people's inventories, knowing time is short. I wish cosmetics, hand lotions, hair products, etc. etc. would STOP changing and/or deleting great products that are working!! Lip Smackers are the only lip balm I can tolerate. I have tried and tried to find a replacement,paying way too much money for products that end up in the garbage. I wish Bonne Belle would bring them back. They also work wonderfully over lips I cover with a nice lip liner pencil. The shine and color stays on for many hours, including eating - just use the Lip Smackers again and the color comes right up fresh! Great product - bad company!

The two sets of tweezers are a very pale pink (rather than the bubble-gum pink in the photo.). They seem very well made. They feel substantial in my hand, not flimsy like cheap tweezers do.<br /><br />I tweeze daily and have bought many, many tweezers -- often very cheap ones -- over the years. The cheap tweezers usually don't last long and are pretty flimsy. But, in contrast, these seem very well made. The metal is pretty thick, and they feel substantial and comfortable in my hand. I have only had them for a short time but due to their heavier construction and materials, I expect that they'll last a long time.<br /><br />The slanted-tip tweezer, which I most often use, has tips that are perfectly aligned; they grip the hair well and remove it easily. I was able to finish tweezing very quickly with these.<br /><br />I don't use the pointed-tip tweezers as much but have tried them a couple tmes and they also grip stray and ingrown hairs well. The small scissors  (for trimming brows, etc.) are comfortable enough to use and quite sharp.<br /><br />After having gone through so many cheap tweezers, these are a breath of fresh air. I'm happy to have these and will continue to get a lot of use out of them.	2015-08-01

Having to reach the faucet handle while trying to aim the water jet is problematic for me, and the water can spray everywhere.	2015-08-01

Very gentle yet effective. If I'd had these all along, I probably would not have needed oral surgery (gum grafting). I was so pleased I went looking for them online. No luck then. The surgeon gave me another, and since I could not find them anywhere, he agreed to sell me a bunch. They do wear out faster than sual brushes. But then I believe the point is that they wear out cleaning your teeth and gums rather than wearing out your gums. It's a lot easier, more comfortable, and WAY less expensive to replace toothbrushes than gums. So glad to find these online,. Thank you, Amazon!	2015-08-01

I have naturally curly hair, and the shampoo I use is probably the most important thing, just before the leave-in conditioners and Moroccan Argan Oil. This stuff is OUTSTANDING. My curls are shiny, SOFT, very complimentary to my facial structure (a structure in its late forties, LOL), the curls never fade, and my hair looks healthier than it has in years. This was just a whim; something to try that didn't cost $35 - $40 a bottle and did PRETTY MUCH NOTHING. So glad I tried this. Will buy it as long as it is available to me. Highly recommended.	2015-08-01

I am completely satisfied with this stuff. I recently dyed my light brown hair a darkish platinum blonde, and I just did not want to spend so much money at the salon to touch up my roots. I liked the concept of this product, so I purchased it on a whim. I got a little worried when I read all the awful reviews about it, but I had a very satisfying experience. This was my first time ever using a home hair dye, and I was delightfully surprised.<br />While my roots are still visible, the dye DEFINITELY made them lighter and they blend better with the rest of my hair. I think the key to this stuff is really massaging it into your head. The pictures in the directions don't really show that, but it does say it in the directions. Not only did it lighten up my roots, it also helped to tone down the yellowness that comes with bleached hair. I also added some toning conditioner (the John Frieda purple one) to it, and that made it look really shiny and platinum. A lot of reviews were complaining about the smell, but if you've ever had your hair dyed or bleached, you should be fine. Finally, I had my mom actually apply it (her first time with a home hair dye too!) and I honestly think it would be so hard to do it by yourself. So, my advice would be to ask someone to help. Overall, great product!	2015-08-01

Beauty	5	0	0	N	Y	SPF, Coverage, and Bliss	Want the coverage of a light foundation with the benefits of a moisturizer? Want the spf coverage without the heavy feel and strong sunscreen smell? Missha BB cream is the answer! I was skeptical as to if this would live up to the hype and claims made by the company, and for me it has. Now, this isn't a miracle product, but it has fulfilled the needs I have. Maintaining my skin is extremely important to me so spf is something I try to incorporate into my skin care regimen. However, having sensitive skin, finding a face sunscreen that doesn't break me out is hard to find. This product works like a charm. It not only gives me the spf I crave but a lovely amount of coverage which is a fantastic base for my makeup. Some days I simply wear this and forgo foundation all together. A little bit goes a long way with this product so I believe it is definitely worth the money	2015-08-01

Within recent months, I changed my unnecessary habit of buying &#34;top shelf&#34; skincare products.

What makes designer products allude to being the &#34;must have&#34; is merely a marketing scheme.  One that I refuse to participate in anymore!<br />Except cosmetics like mascara:)<br />The Rosehip Oil has a mild scent which is nice, I detest overbearing aromas for skincare products. It is lightweight and has just the right consistency you would be looking for in an oil.  I used a little on my face and put a couple drops on my unruly hair.  So far my hair feels wonderfully soft and I am impressed by how the oil absorbed into my skin.<br />I actually received this product for a discount and I will BUY this full price when I run out!<br />Helping smaller businesses who make quality products is a rewarding thing to do...	2015-08-01

I am an adult with braces, 35yr, just had them 'installed' a few months ago. I do not know why in the world orthodontists don't automatically send you home with one of these after your new 'hardware' has been mounted in place! I now realize that my teeth have never actually been clean this whole time and that includes 15-20 minutes a night with special brushes, impossible floss and other 'tools' for these braces.<br /><br />  My parents had an old Waterpik (same model, old packaging) that kept on working, so I borrowed it for a few nights and didn't want to part. It was beautifully gross to see all the 'extra' food flush out of my mouth with the waterpik and that was AFTER brushing and brushing and re-brushing to get them clean. I never realized how much was actually left in there, hidden from the brush, stuck under the metal, bacteria waiting to feed off it.<br /><br />  Please, for the love of your teeth, if you have braces, order a waterpik! You are already purchasing a 'major appliance' for your mouth anyway, just think of this as insurance for it. A small investment to pay for a happier smile. And toss the nasty and pointless toothpaste... just use baking soda on your brush and/or dissolve some in the water to use in the waterpik. Baking soda helps to balance the pH levels in your mouth so bad bacteria can't grow... Like you can even pronounce the ingredients in your tube of paste, let alone know what its really doing to your mouth!<br /><br />  By the way, my three children, 5, 8, 12, love it also! I wouldn't get the 'Kid' version if your little ones are 6-7 or older as my 8yr is already at level 6 in the intensity and the kid version only goes up to 3. I guess level 3 is fine for some people, but I am using this in place of floss because of braces and you need more intensity then 3 to get the job done. And since these last a long time, your kids will probably grow out of the level 3 quickly. Just a thought.<br /><br />  So, if you want a clean mouth, braces or not, toss some baking soda in the water tub with warm water, stir and cut on the dentist in a tube. Slowly work your way up to 9 or 10 (over a few weeks) and get ready to feel satisfied! ☺r not, toss some baking soda in the water tub with warm water, stir and cut on the dentist in a tube. Slowly work your way up to 9 or 10 (over a few weeks) and get ready to feel satisfied! ☺	2015-08-01

Open box item and it was a bargain it was 40-50% off. I was honestly bored of buying gillette razors as it was to expensive as i have to shave daily. At the end of the day I have owned an old phillips shaver that still works great and it was not maintained at all. So I invested in this shaver. I love the wet shave as it is not irritating to my skin. I love the cleaning mechanism as it is hassle free.	2015-08-01

I play golf and garden in the Texas heat/sun, and the back of my neck was rather leathery looking.  I usually spray my toner on my face, then while it is barely damp, add the hyaluronic acid, just patting it on...including the back of my neck.  It's made a very noticeable difference not only on my face, but also in reducing the leather-look on my neck and chest!  I even had a friend ask if I had had an eye lift!  That's proof enough for me that this is making a difference!	2015-08-01

These just came in and I'm already in love.  I had issues with my glasses sitting right on my cheeks, or if I tried to push them up higher, with my eyelashes hitting the lenses.  These give a nice height to raise my glasses away from my face and keep them from slipping.  The wrap-around design makes them way more secure on the nose pad, and I just trimmed them down a little with scissors since the wrap-around part was a little bigger than needed.  My glasses are acrylic with no separate nose pads of its own, and these aren't visible at all, which is a problem I had with locally bought pads.  Since I just got them I'm not sure how long they last, but the material seems easy to clean with regular lens spray and wipes, so I doubt make-up build-up will be a problem. These take a while to get you from China, but I can already tell it was worth the wait.	2015-08-01

I'm relatively new to moisturizer in general, so the only comparison I have is to the Kiehl's Facial fuel. I loved the Kiehl's product, but thought I may be able to find something else at a lower price worth trying out. When compared, the Bull Dog left my face feeling stickier, and did not seem to soak in to the skin as quickly, or as well. The big issue here, however - and the reason I'm writing this review - is the scent. It smells very &#34;hippie&#34; - think heavy amounts of Jasmine and &#34;natural&#34; oils - and VERY strong. I only wore it for one day before just biting the bullet and picking up another bottle of the Kiehls because the scent of the Bull Dog became overwhelming.

That day came yesterday.  Broke through the manufacturer's seal and pulled out the contents only to discovery that no nozzles were included.  Because I bought it a year ago, it's too late to return to Amazon.  Tried to use the nozzles from my other waterpiks, but none of them work.  Need the ones especially made for this model.  So now I have to buy these hard-to-find replacement nozzles that aren't sold by Waterpik, and also, aren't cheap. Even if they are the right ones for this model, not sure they would work well.  Without the nozzles in place, the water pressure seems to be weak.  The unit also has a clumsier setup than the newer models. A much larger water tank rests on top of the entire unit.  When it's in pace and full of water, I'm thinking about whether it's stable.  Stable or not, it's harder to get to the buttons and nozzle thing.  All things considered, wish I had never bought this. Going to cut my losses, throw it away, and get a newer model. Hard to understand why another company isn't making a good-quality alternative and giving Waterpik some competition.	2015-08-01

Unfortunately for me, it's not a product I will plan to purchase.  After using the product, my teeth definitely feel fresh and clean.  When I first used it, I was a little surprised by the taste of step #2 - you can definitely taste the peroxide. But I quickly got used to that and didn't find it bothersome.  The end result is a minty taste.  The first time using a whitening product and did not find any improvement in the color of my teeth.  In addition, the two steps became a bit cumbersome . . . had to track time used, don't ingest, don't rinse/do rinse, etc.  This isn't really a product for me.	2015-08-01

I really liked the fragrance and it would last all day long, so I was happy to see the larger bottle for less on Amazon and ordered it.  However, this scent, while similar, is not very strong and I find I need two sprays to get the same effect of one spray on the previous bottle from Sephora.  It's almost like this larger bottle was diluted.  I echo other people's comments that the packaging is not quite the same either, so I feel like I got cheated with some generic version.  I guess you truly get what you pay for.	2015-08-01

I used a different brand for a plain konjac sponge around a year ago and it was okay, nothing to write home about, I even forgot about it and stopped using it. Not so with these; I look forward to washing my face in the morning with them. The texture is soothing, there arent any odd smells, and having a rounded and a flat side make it super easy to adjust to the contours of your face. I havent used them with soap, just warm water, but my facial skin looks good. I am pregnant, and not the pretty glowy skin kind either. My face has been dull and uneven no matter what I do. Within 2 or 3 days of using the La Lune charcoal sponge I noticed I was less dull and more even. To be fair, I am also approaching the third trimester, so hormones could be playing their role, but I credit the sponge. I buff my face in circular motions with it for about 2 or so minutes. (So long largely just because it feels so nice!) I do have pretty sensitive skin, but I have not reacted poorly at all and I have been using it for roughly 2 weeks. So see, it doesnt take long to fall in love with them! I am giving these to all the women on my holiday gift list this year, that is how strongly I endorse this product. I look forward to trying other La Lune products since this one is so wonderful.	2015-08-01

Once the stores stopped carrying it	i have used this product for a couple years and would get great results. Once the stores stopped carrying it, I bought this in bulk off of amazon in order to stock up on my favorite product. Shortly after, my hair started to get really damaged(dry, unruly hairs on scalp, ) and was not looking as good. I wonder if what I ordered was legit? Or, did my hair just have enough of the alcohol content  in this product? I could definitley smell more alcohol in the bulk products  I ordered. Needless to say, I have to switch products to save my hair. I am now trying the sister product to this, the gel one.. I used it once so far at night on wet hair and seemed to get good results. The gel does not have alcohol in it. I hope this will work for me for a while.	2015-08-01

They come in a box of singles and as described have different designs on them. Description wise, it has medium-soft bristles, a small head that fits well for 5yr old, and its  about the size of a standard pen.<br /><br />The only defect that the brush has, in my case, is the grip is fairly large. When it's time for my 6yr old to brush her tongue she gags a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a good manual toothbrush.	2015-08-01

I received this product at a discounted price for my unbiased opinion. I was very impressed when I opened this package and saw the carrying case, it is very pretty and looks to be made of high quality materials. My initial plan was to give this to my daughter when I finished reviewing them...she is out of luck. I have used them every day and continue to love the brushes. They are well formed and give me all the variety I need for makeup applications that I do for myself. The case keeps them stored neatly and will travel well. I did not know how bad my other brushes were until I got these. I plan on throwing all my others out and keeping just this set. I also plan on buying a few more sets of these, at full price, for Christmas gifts. Yes I know it's August, but when I find something that can be given to any woman and be appreciated I try to stock up for those unusual times you need to give a gift to someone that you barely know. This is perfect for that, it will also fit into my daughter's stocking really well.	2015-08-01

This Konjac sponge is a shriveled hard rock when it arrives, but don't let that fool you because if you'll soak it in a bowl of lukewarm water for a few minutes the sponge nearly doubles in size and becomes soft and cushiony.  You can then use the sponge as it is or in conjunction with your regular facial cleanser remove makeup, dirt, and oil. I like to use mine along with my Vitamin C facial cleanser when I shower, and I use the Konjac to gently massage my face  in circular motions for about 30 seconds.<br /><br />These sponges let you get right up into your pores for a deep clean that clears away dead skin cells, clogged pores, and oils. The unique net-like structure of the sponge gently massages and revitalizes my complexion leaving my face feeling soft and renewed. Squeeze the Konjac sponge between your palms to wring out the water when you're finished using it, then let it air dry in a well ventilated place using the attached cotton string. Get your sponge wet and soft again before each use and it should last for several months. I didn't particularly care for the scent of this sponge, but I love how soothing and gentle it feels when I use it.  Retail sample provided at no cost for evaluation and review purposes. My review is based entirely on my own opinions formed by using the Lavender Konjac Sponge in order to evaluate and test it.	2015-08-01

I am reviewing based on my initial reactions and will update my review after continued use. The system is comprised of two products. Step 1 is for for deep cleaning and Step 2 is a polishing/whitening agent. You use each step for one minute; spit after Step 1 but do not rinse. Step 1 seemed like regular toothpaste and had a similar &#34;taste.&#34; It did not seem to get very bubbly. I prefer a toothpaste with more &#34;suds&#34; because I feel like I get a better clean. With that said, however, I do feel like my teeth are cleaner than with my previous toothpaste. I also was not a fan of the &#34;not rinsing&#34; aspect before brushing with step 2. Gross. Step 2 didn't taste great but was much better than the traditional strips. You could faintly smell/taste the hydrogen peroxide but it was ok. The second time I used the product I could feel a slight tingling but no sensitivity which was nice. I did &#34;feel&#34; like it was working. Pros so far: motivates me to brush for a full 2 minutes and twice a day, not bad tasting, gentle whitening, not messy, not an extra product or time spent (just usual teeth brushing which you should be doing anyway. Cons: toothpaste doesn't get bubbly, whitening effects are gradual and not immediate, not supposed to rinse in between steps.	2015-08-01

It really works, it helped subside the eczema and clears my son's skin. We usually mix it with water in the bath tub when my son is going to take a bath. We let him sit there and play in the bath tub for several minutes and soak himself. The only down side of this item is, since its an oil based product its hard to clean the tub and you must be careful while putting your child in the tub because it can get very slippery when you mix it with water. Otherwise its a very good product.	2015-08-01

I was in a bind, without my personal set up, and needed a lot of gear very quickly. The liner machine in the set was okay-ish, but the way the shader was designed makes it impossible to wrap any rubber bands around the needle for tension because they just slip off. Keep the machines, the clip cord, and the foot pedal, but throw everything else out. The ink is garbage, don't even bother with it, many of the needle packs were either punctured or opened, and the power supply died in a matter of days. The lockable case is nice, though, and it's probably worth more than everything in it.	2015-08-01

It doesn't harden your nails and glossy nail polish is probably cheaper.  If you are bothered by splitting nails, the ONLY product I've found that really works is Gorilla Glue.  Here's how you should apply it:<br /><br />Squirt a drop of Gorilla Glue onto a piece of wax paper--don't squirt it directly onto your split nail, or you will end up gluing your nail to your finger.<br /><br />Take a toothpick and apply the gorilla glue to the split in your nail.<br /><br />After the glue has dried, cut your nail short, leaving as little of the split as you possibly can.  The remaining split with its spot of glue will grow out in due time and you can trim it off.	2015-08-01

I not only use this as deep conditioner when I wash my hair but as well as a leave-in conditioner on the go.	2015-08-01

I used this for experimentation. I wanted a safe way to stain my fingertips black, not sure why but when I saw it on someone else I needed it to happen. I obviously got more than my finger tips, this happened because I applied to my finger tips and decided to put on gloves which smeared it up my hand leaving it in a patchy application above the knuckle. The color fade to blue, and doesn't exactly last as long as I was wanting, but it worked. I might purchase again after experimenting with a few other ways of staining.	2015-08-01

Even throughout puberty my skin was pretty decent. No acne, just occasional breakouts. But a few months ago I got these awful little bumps on my temples. They weren't zits and had nothing in them. They were skin colored and just felt like sandpaper. And you could only see them if the light hit my face right. So I didn't think too much about it and figured they'd go away on their own eventually if I left them alone. But nope. They spread down my jawline and onto my cheeks. So the entire lower portion of my face was like a giant swath of sandpaper. Ugh! Then in a matter of days it turned into deep cystic acne. I had a friend look at me one day and think I had fallen off a bike or something because it looked like my cheek was gouged because it was so red and swollen. I have been trying EVERYTHING to get rid of it. First I went makeup free, took recommended supplements, exercised, drank lots of water, ate healthier than I already do. And definitely didn't touch it. But none of that helped so I started looking into different products. I've been using this sulfur soap for a few months now. And, I don't think my acne is the kind that is responding to it very much. I did notice that it has helped keep it in check because I forgot it on vacation for a few days and my skin did not like that. But it also hasn't healed it. Still searching for the holy grail that will solve whatever it is that's molesting my face. But until then this is helping me at least keep it from getting worse.<br /><br />UPDATE: After trying this for a while I had to give it up and went a dermatologist. Now, finally, my acne is cleared up. I began using benzoyl peroxide wash during the time I was still recovering from it. But after it was cleared I tried using this again. I figured sulfur soap would be much less harsh. Nope. My skin broke out immediately. I figured maybe it was just a coincidence and tried it again at a later time. Same thing. I wanted it to work so I tried it again later on. Still a no go. Each time I used this my skin broke out. I gave it a few more goes. But after trying it multiple times I finally had to admit it couldn't be caused by anything else. It was the soap. I'm pretty sad because I much prefer the idea of using sulfur on my skin to other harsher alternatives. However, I did find a sulfur scrub that my skin loves ([...]). So that isn't to say you should rule out sulfur. You just have to find the product that fits you just right. And for me this wasn't it.ried it again later on. Still a no go.

First things first, this is vegan and cruelty free which is awesome. My favorite thing about this product is its actives. Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide are physical blockers which means they are not absorbed into the blood stream but also means the product will protect you longer. These sit on the surface of skin reflecting light rather than chemical sunscreens that work through the layers of skin. Chemical sunscreens absorb sun light.<br /><br />This sunscreen is white cast and of a heavier weight you'd expect with sunscreen. The photos are of my legs. It does have a white cast as you can see but that's almost guaranteed with 6% zinc oxide. My biggest qualm with this sunscreen, and why I removed a star, is that it piles. I tried patting it on, rubbing, and nothing stopped it from clotting up. On my legs though, it's hardly noticeable.<br /><br />That said, you could try putting on a moisturizer before hand to create a less dry environment than my legs appear to be?<br /><br />HINT: If you look closely, my knees look like Ninja Turtles	2015-08-01

As with all of this series of Kerastase, including the shampoo, leave-in conditioner, etc., this smells simply great, and quite unlike the cheaper brands from bix box stores.  I usually use it only as a quick rinse-out conditioner;  however, if you leave it in for a while, read the paper, etc., and then rinse out, apparently it works even better.<br /><br />This particular product is a bit pricey -- even from amazon -- but well worth it.

This toner feels fresh and light on my skin.  I love that the ingredients have no weird junk in them and nothing that can damage my skin rather than helping it.  The packaging is so beautiful too.

It's a little bigger and stiffer than what I would typically use for an eye shadow brush but it's perfect for doing an all over color before coming in with a smaller brush to define. I think it would make an awesome concealer brush.<br /><br />The brush is well constructed, no loose bristles and no toxic stink out of the package like some other brushes I've tried. I have several other older bare minerals brushes and this one is softer than those. Nice short handle for easy maneuvering and perfect for a travel bag.<br /><br />I received a discount on this item for my honest review.	2015-08-01

PROS:<br />* It stops the sweat<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Irritates my skin.<br /><br />As a kid, I had to be careful of what soaps I used, or I would break out.  From adolescence on (I'm almost 40 now), I've not had any problems with skin irritation from anything, whether it's deodorants, laundry soap, garage chemicals, whatever.<br /><br />Except this.  I bought 5 different deodorants to try out, and this is the only one that makes my pits itchy.  I'm fine for most of the day, but then in the afternoon, and for several days after, I'm itchy.<br /><br />I would call this 1 star, but this stops the sweat.  Many deodorants/antiperspirants just don't work very well, but this one does.<br /><br />The problem chemical is C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.  That's the one missing from Degree Adrenaline, which works just as well, but without skin itchies.  The strong, active ingredient is Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex.  Anything 15-20% of AZT works well for me.	2015-08-01

I also use it on bug bites and rashes as I cannot tolerate itching and end up damaging my skin drim scratching. I gave it 4 stars because it's kind of puffy so I end up wasting it when trying to apply to my ears, and also because it comes in a metal tube, which I usually like but in this case, the cream constantly oozes out if you don't replace the top immediately.

It's completely out of character, but I trend toward super chapped lips, and lipgloss is as easy to put on as chapstick.  Some lipglosses, like this one, outlast chapstick by a LOT.  Ok, here's the rundown.<br /><br />Color:  Sheer, shiny, and subtle.  I like that!  Some people don't, and prefer more pigment.<br />SPF:  20.  And it works.  My lips burn, so I feel like a good judge of these things.<br />Feel:  Wet & smooth.  I really like the feel, and would compare it to Buxom, though of course it doesn't tingle and it fortunately it isn't nearly as sticky.  In fact, I'd call it slippery.  My SO still dubs me &#34;Princess Sticky-Lips&#34; when it's on, though, so apparently it doesn't feel as nice to smooch.<br />Durability:  Magic. :)  I really like that part!  It easily lasts as long as Buxom, if not longer, and it outlasts Soft Lips and the fruity Blistex chapsticks, my other two go-to SPF lip products, by leaps and bounds.<br />Flavor & Smell:  pleasant and fruity.  Slightly more sophisticated than fruit punch, but that's the closest smell I can think of.<br /><br />So, I'm a fan.  I hope this review helps you determine whether you would be, too!	2015-08-01

I have been trying to slowly use only safe beauty products and had read that this top-coat was a healthier/safer option than those major nail polish companies. Unfortunately I am unimpressed. I painted my nails midday yesterday and already this morning most nails are chipped! I used it on a SpaRitual polish I've used before (which lasts about a week without chilling with a Sally Hansen top coat I used to use). Also, unfortunately the top coat also doesn't go on as smoothly as most - I had to glob it on for it to not have streaks. It's also a bit dull and not very shiny. Bummer.	2015-08-01

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Helps keep my skin clear and glowing	I have oily, acne-prone skin. I have dealt with acne for almost 30 years so I have to be very cautious about what skincare products I use. I was successfully using a prescription topical medication with a retinoid that is no longer covered by my insurance. It is expensive to buy on its own. Therefore I needed to revamp my skin care routine to stay blemish free without it. I needed affordable products that work. I also purchased a sonic face brush to help with exfoliation. Currently I use a cleanser, two serums, a product with benozoyl peroxide and then a moisturizer each evening (all products but the one with benzoyl peroxide are from InstaNatural).<br /><br />I prefer skincare products that are vegan and not tested on animals because I have been a vegetarian for 22 years. I have been using InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer once a day in the pm for about 3 weeks.You just need a pump for the face and neck. It absorbs quickly. In conjunction with the InstaNatural serums and other products, it helps keep my skin clear and glowing. I would recommend this product. Please wear sunscreen every day because retinol and retinoid products make your skin more prone to sun damage.	2015-08-01

I was introduced to the brand through a friend and have been pleased with everything I've purchased or received from them. The Argan oil was no exception to this. It blended well with the carrier oil I use and didn't separate as the carrier oil hardened.<br /><br />I did use the oil as a hot oil treatment on my hair and it seemed to work great. I have only been using this for a few days so far, but it seems to be working well.<br /><br />I gave this a four star because I did expect their to be a scent to it. There was no scent, not even the slightest. I've used other Argan oils in the past and they did have some form of scent to them, so I was a little disappointed in that.	2015-08-01

I used to use the Nexxus Heat Protexx spray, but since the stores stopped carrying them I was in need of finding something similar. I found this and I'm happy I did! I sprayed it on my hair after the next shower and blow dried my hair (which I rarely do) not all the way dry but 90%, and I was planning on straightening my hair after. There was no need to straighten my hair though! It might be the flax seed oil or something else in the new formula, but it left my hair gorgeous and wavy but way more &#34;put-together&#34; than my hair used to look. It leaves your hair sleek and shiny and healthy-looking while protecting it from heat. Highly worth the purchase! Definitely buying this all the time!<br /><br />The only con I have is that it kind of smells like barbie doll plastic.

Darn this was to replace the pro curl Pantene they stopped making which helped stop frizz and tame the humidity anyway no where as good.

I have fine hair for curly hair with lots of frizzes if it's humid. I like the natural curls..but this does not perform. I do wish these companies would stop trying to improve when they got the right product the first time..or at least continue to support the first one while messing around with the formula for others.	2015-08-01

It took me 2+ hours to do my hair (longish) as opposed to 45-60 mins with the Original - I do have thick, wavy/unmanageable hair, but that's not an excuse for why it took so long. Its highest heat setting definitely does not get as hot as the Original - strange, because it's supposed to go up to 425 F vs 410 F on the Original. And don't get me started on the 2-way feature - it was supposed to make my life easier, but I think the reason it took me so long to do my hair was because the barrel changed directions on me so many times, and this, without my consciously double-tapping it. I admit it's a bit of a learning curve, but my hair also did get caught on the edge of the barrel several times, and I lost more than a few strips of hair to entanglement - even had to snip off some hair with a pair of scissors :-( This NEVER happened to me with the Original. The bristles on this are flimsier too than on the Original... Overall, I wanted to love it, and give it a chance, but it's back to the Original for me. It really worked wonders on my thick, unmanageable long hair.	2015-08-01

Not greasy or sticky.	I use body moisturizer just about every day so I was interested in trying one of these spray on products. Please be sure to shake up the can before using, as the directions state. I didn't read the directions first so when I tried to use the product the first time nothing came out. Shake and then no problem. I do not like heavily fragranced lotions so was a little leary my first time but no worries. This scent is very light but heavenly. It really does smells amazing. I was sniffing my arm hours after I put it on. I was also worried it would get on everything like hair spray but that wasn't a problem either. It sprays out in about a 1&#34; radius so it's easy to keep it all on your skin and all off your floor. It does not apply like an oil which was a good surprise. It is truly a thin lotion and with one or two quick swipes it spreads and soaks in to your skin. It dries within seconds so you can dress immediately and not worry about sticking to or staining your clothes. I really liked this product and would purchase it again. I feel the original retail price was a bit high but it appears to be available for purchase at a much more reasonable rate. I received a discount towards the purchase of this product.	2015-08-01

Quick delivery! and product arrived in excellent condition. I love this hair piece. I read some other reviews which said that it gets tangled after a few wears. Yes honestly it gets tangled very easily, what did you expect? It's synthetic hair. It can last very long once you take good care of it. This is my third Vivica A Fox half wig I have owned and they all lasted very long. The last one I owned lasted for a year and yes honestly it does begin to shed after a while but overall its  good. Some quick tips: Comb with a wide tooth comb after every wear, when washing do not comb just soak in some shampoo rinse then soak it in conditioner with warm water.	2015-08-01

Stings my face and makes my eyes water. Too drying for my face and I have oily to combination skin.  Leaves my skin feeling tight and drying. The step 1 foaming face wash that complements with this toner is already a little drying on my face. Along with this toner, my face will feel like a raisin. I've used half of the bottle and gave it to my mom who have the oily-est skin ever and she even says that it was too drying and stings her face.	2015-08-01

The Forever Candy 103 is very similar to Continual Crimson 213.  Forever Candy has a subtle sheen while Continual Crimson is flatter and a very slight bit darker.  Forever Candy appears somewhat pinker on the screen than in real life, but I wear Continual Crimson all the time and I love this new shade as well.  I ordered this through Subscribe and Save and got the discount.  I've been using Infallible lip colors for several years and this is a new formulation is a big improvement over the former compacts in the shiny reflective case.  This formulation goes on more translucent and is less clumpy and cakey.  A touch up after lunch will carry you through the day.	2015-08-01

I understand Nioxin is now made in Mexico and have used that with great results. This on the other hand is terrible. My hair feels greasy just hours after using this version of Nioxin system 3 cleanser. The original Nioxin System 3 cleanser and the version made in Mexico both left my hair feeling clean up to the next days shower even if there was more than 24 hours between time.<br /><br />Not sure if it is some kind of scam to get the price so low.  Won't buy this product for H&H Wholesale again.  Will continue to pay more per once for the liter bottle since they have never let me down.	2015-08-01

I have a Remington 1&#34; straightener that I love, but I've let my hair grow longer and the 1&#34; is just too small. I originally purchased the Remington S9620, but was very unimpressed. It made a squeak sounds as it ran down my hair and just felt cheap so I got this one. I have an Infinity hairdryer that I've had for over 5 years that still works great so I expect this straightener to last a while. I like that it only has a few heat setting which is all you need. My hair is thick and fairly tough to straighten (naturally wavy), and the 2nd to hottest does the job perfectly.<br />It smelled horrible the first few times I used it, but has stopped making the smell when turned on. I still don't feel like it's quite the quality of my 1&#34; but overall I'm happy with my purchase.	2015-08-01

It's not tight anymore! It's not dry, and flakey, and sad!! I can't believe a low pH cleanser really mattered that much. I've never had one that didn't make my face feel tight after washing it, I thought that's what clean was supposed to feel like. 100% purchasing again. This bottle will last me a long time, too, since I only need half a pump to a full pump every night. And the clip it comes with to stop it from being pressed down is pretty neat, too!

They are a little slippery and a couple of times I ended up getting the liquid in my eyes so it takes a little bit of practice to get it right.  I wish the eye holes were just a little bit larger but overall I really liked this product.

In a time when tempatures are in the upper 90s. I would recommend having airthight packaging. It just happened to reach 100 on the day this package arrived, 113 heat index.<br /><br />Everything in the box melted. Shea butter, cocoa butter etc. The others were in airtight sealed packaging. This mango butter is the one that leaked in the box and coated everything. It was just enough to cause a great mess.<br /><br />I was amused that everything melted but not so much having to get the grease of each item.	2015-08-01

This is the only makeup I wear.  The only critique that I have is that it seems like I use up a whole stick of this too quickly.  I haven't actually measured how long it takes me to use up a whole one (mostly because I have a couple and they are all 1/2 used).  Still, I love how easy it is to apply and don't feel the need to reapply during the day.

I have tried other minerals and Bella Pierre is way better then anything I have used. Bella feels dry & soft to the touch, it long lasting and I have oily T zone and everything I have used, I mean everything I used breaks up after two hours and Bella doesn't. It has a pretty good coverage. I have melasma and it covering most of it but then again my melasma is light right now because of the product I'm using so I really don't know if it will really cover if it was full blown. I do love the fact that it doesn't rub off on my husband shirts when I rest my face on him. I would highly recommend trying this product and this seller does deliver fast, unlike other that take forever to ship and I that take long to reach their destination.

She is three.  She stayed still for a half an hour so it could dry on her fingers and toes.  I was looking for a non-toxic option for her and saw this brand on EWG.  Anyhow several hours later she took a bath and I noticed pink chips floating in the tub.  Some of them had completely come off.  When she got out, it looked like she had worn the polish for weeks.  Not one nail (Hands and toes) had more than half the paint left.  I don't know if it was old or just poor quality.  I am going to try the piggy paint next.	2015-08-01

[[VIDEOID:90b14872dcbca570bfe2dbe278ee67fa]] I received this product as a gift. I was really impressed with the power of the curling iron. I have thick hair and when I try to curl my hair I normally need to hold the iron on the hair for a long time. With this curling iron it works in just a couple seconds! The fact that it has a straightener as well is a great feature because when I travel I like to do my hair straight and curly. This normally creates a problem where I have to bring two irons. This combination of curling iron and straightener will be great and save some room when I travel on my next vacation. Love it!	2015-08-01

I use it every night before I go to bed. The only down side is that it does make your skin a tad sensitive to the sun. I forgot the sunblock the next day and had a pink face for it. I normally just wear a light moisturizer with an spf and don't have any issues. I have also gotten my mother and a few friends hooked on it. The benefits are worth wearing a little sunscreen or a hat. I have had quite a few compliments about how much younger I look already. I also like the pump top, it makes it a little easier to get out than the dropper kind.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (TO TRY) AND LEAVE AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

I didn't know my beard could feel so smooth and well loved. It's hard to take a day off now. I'm hooked.<br /><br />It takes care of the itching or dry or flaking skin below the facial hair (which was a huge issue for me before) and my beard feels well conditioned and smoother in my manly fingers. I use a boars hair brush every morning after application. And if I'm feeling extra manly, I even twist those mustache hairs to do what I tell them to do. Cuz that's what real men do. Altogether, I am planning to buy more when I run out. Love the bourbon scent too. Not too strong, but just right intensity.	2015-08-01

However when I blow dry it becomes frizzy which drives me nuts.  I had heard about argan oil from a friend so when I was offered the chance to review this Elbahya Argan Oil I jumped on the chance.  I did get this at a reduced price but it worked so well I would pay full price for it.  I decided to try this on my hair first.  I started out with about three drops and worked it into my ends.  I also worked some more towards the top of my hair and scalp, this is where I end up having flyaways.  I blow dried as normal and was so happy to see that the oil not only tamed my frizz, but it also made my hair softer.  I also had good results when using it on my face.  It absorbs quickly and leaves your face feeling soft.  It's a great product for the money and because you use very little each time, it lasts for a while.	2015-08-01

This set was the first set of brushes I've properly used and they were great tools! As a beginner to properly applying my makeup, I heavily recommend these handy brushes (well most of them) to newcomers and even pros. For the price, of course it's a bargain deal and the best part is they're very effective. The only brush I didn't use was the one with the smallest tip (I forget the name), I had no use for it. The buffing brush has become one of my favorite brushes but it is also my least favorite to clean. real Techniques definitely did a great job with this line but the only cons I've recently had with these brushes, is now the bar on the tools are peeling and the brush names are fading so the life expectancy isn't as long as I wanted it to be. I may buy a new set for those reasons.	2015-08-01

Naked 1 is highly pigmented buttery eyeshadows that go on really well but for close to $60! W7's eyeshadows have a  similar colors with good pigment, and for the price you can't go wrong! The lighter colors need a little extra layers and more blending to show the actual color, but the dark colors are really good :). Its more powdery then buttery, like drug store eyeshadow. The dark colors have a good pigment, and do a great smokey eye! The light colors have glitter, and give a nice shimmery eye for night time.. OVERALL: I love the colors, the price, and the application. My package arrived to me 12 days earlier then predicted. :)<br /><br />The only thing is i wish it had more matte shade, there are only 2 matte shades the rest of shimmer/glitter.	2015-08-01

The color chart/advertisement had shown that the balm would have a sweet, baby pink color.

I had a friend with much lighter pink lips try it on and her lips did not change color either, proving that Strawberry Milk is not tinted much/at all.

Then, a slight bow is performed.<br /><br />Of course, you don't need to practice Yoga, or listen to Sitar music, in order to appreciate the beauty of this well designed diffuser, with its relaxing light show, and cool mist diffusing various essential oils. I think the design of this diffuser is well done. Even though its faux wood, you really have to look twice, before you believe its not real. In the base of the diffuser are the function buttons. One button activates the mist function, with two choices for mist intensity, light or heavy. The other button controls the mood lighting, that illuminates the white sleeve that covers the water tank. Every diffuser I've ever seen or reviewed, has something about it that makes it unique. This diffuser has a mood lighting, that differs from all other diffusers. Normally the colors slowly morph into each other. So the Blue turns turquois, then to forest green, then a light spring green, into yellow, orange, etc. Not this diffuser. You turn it on, and you get dark blue. Then, it flashes into light blue. Then its suddenly green, then indigo, then red. Of course, you can just pick a color, and let the diffuser remain lit on that color. The water tank holds 120ml, about half a cup, but I added a bit more water, and didn't notice any problems with the mist quality or quantity. Add a few drops of your essential oil into the water, no more than 5 or 6 drops are needed. Then, relax. When it runs out of water, the STOP light flashes. (Right below the MIST and LIGHT indicator lights, between the buttons.)  Never put &#34;perfume oils&#34;, or other cheap fragrance liquids inside the tank. Don't even use essential oils, that have been diluted with Jojoba oil either. Those oils will create a gunk around the diffuser's ceramic disc, that produces the ultrasonic vibration. The great thing about a diffuser, is that you can stop spraying artificial air fresheners, or scented candles, and other artificial odors into your home. Those chemicals go into the air you breathe.  Then, they go in the body.  Personally, I'm allergic to artificial fragrances.  They smell like chemicals, harsh, and often sharp.  Instead, imagine the soft, relaxing fragrance of the herb fields of France, covered with Lavender. Or the orange groves of Arabia. Perhaps the myrrh trees in Somalia, or cinnamon oil from Madagascar. A personal favorite is a diffuser filled with Patchouli oil from mystical India, perhaps mixed into Sandalwood oil. If I'm suffering from a lung ailment, with a cough, I use some peppermint and a touch of Eucalyptus.  For headaches, the traditional favorite of the Queen of Hungry was Eau de Cologne, which was 2 drops lavender oil, 2 drops orange oil (or bergamot oil is better), and 3 drops of Rosemary oil. Aromatherapy is fine art for the nose. As you practice this art, you'll develop a more keen sense of smell.  Plus, if you want to study the lore and history behind various smells, you could by a book on aromatherapy, or the history of perfumery. This is a fascinating subject, very much tied into herbology. Instead of distilling the herbs and drinking the tea, or swallowing the herbs in capsules, the herbs' most important (essential) oils are extracted and bottled. With essential oils and a diffuser, the healing properties of the seeds, leaves, bark, flowers or fruits are drawn into the cool mist, then diffused into the air.  As the lung and sinuses inhale the aroma, the healing properties of the essential oils start to work. Some oils will stimulate the body, like Peppermint, some relax, like lavender. Some oils have the properties of incense, creating a soft mood in a room, and masking any animal smell, or lack of bathing. (Its true, even the wealthiest people in the middle ages seldom bathed. Instead, they poured perfume on themselves. Deodorants have been around for a long time.) Good deodorant smells include oil of rose, (yin, very spiritual), or Patchouli oil (yang in quality, you will either love or hate the smell. I love it) even Frankincense or Myrrh. Why not put essential oil of Pine into a diffuser during Christmas, especially if you have an artificial tree? You could buy essential oil of citronella, and use your diffuser outside, during a picnic. I have somewhere between 30 to 40 various essential oils, and often mix them into my own, personal creations to compliment or change my mood. Or cover over my cat's smell. However, you dont need to start out with all that. Perhaps buy an essential Oil kit, with 6 different scents, or even just buy two or three essential oils when you purchase this diffuser. I would recommend peppermint (in case you're sick, or want a stimulating smell), then buy Orange oil, Lavender oil, then an essential oil that speaks to you personally, like Cedarwood oil, or Patchouli. Women love Ylang-Ylang oil, which smells very close to Jasmine. Whatever you decide, you know that you are going to help your lungs recover from years of artificial smells from candles, air fresheners and fragrance oils.

I personally loved the smell on me, subtle, not overpowering, fresh, clean. I love that it's oil because it goes on with just a few drops.<br /><br />The real test was to find out what people think. The very first day I received compliments from everybody that got close enough or I walked past. I probably shouldn't rave too much because I see only 11 bottles left in stock, and soon there will only be 10 left.<br /><br />If you have doubts, think about it, a good scent will cost you more than $25! This one is AMAZING, I love it and I have chicks and guys wanting to smell me all day long.<br /><br />If you're looking for a unique scent that is fresh, with a hit of Vetiver, and other great oils, buy this one! I hope the seller won't sell out!	2015-08-01

Um, am I the only one that can't smell anything? I only gave it two stars because the LED light function is cool, but I bought this so my room could smell nice, not because I needed a nightlight. Even if I add 15 drops of essential oil, the scent doesn't fill up the room, or even half the room for that matter. Mind you, my room is not big at all. I think the problem is, the vapor doesn't shoot up very high or far. I can't smell anything unless I put my nose 3 inches away from the diffuser..   UPDATE: after using a different brand of essential oil... I can smell the scent lightly throughout the room. So I guess it depends on which brand or ..which essential oil you use??	2015-08-01

This serum is great! The packaging is great, the pump is nice, and the product comes out nicely. I use this after I wash and tone my skin, and I don't use an additional moisturizer afterwards since my skin is so oily. This gives just the right amount of moisture without making my face oily or greasy.  I feel like my skin is actually starting to GLOW!  It's amazing! I'm so excited for the results already!  What a difference using a good Vitamin C serum can make!!!! I'm SO glad I found this!!! I have included a few photos of my skin after using this for about two weeks.  I have NO makeup on in any of these photos! :)  I'm also 34 years old.<br /><br />Enjoy this serum and have a great day! :)	2015-08-01

THESE	Calling all Tweezerman lovers!<br />I. LOVE. THESE. TWEEZERS. I had recently lost my Tweezerman tweezers and was pretty upset about it. All the other tweezers in my house (Revlon, CVS brand, some other random pair) just didn't get the job done like those dang tweezers. Tweezerman is not a cheap brand, especially when you're paying for something as small as tweezers, but quality really does add up in my book. To purchase the same mini tweezers I had had previously from Tweezerman on Amazon, it was going to cost around $11.50, but what I didn't like about that is that I couldn't choose the color of the tweezers, I was just going to be sent one of three color options and it'd be a surprise when I opened the package. (I know color doesn't really matter, but it does to me!) I stumbled upon these tweezers in my search and they had awesome reviews and were compared to Tweezerman. They seriously are AWESOME. They're just like my old tweezers that I loved so dearly - except these are full-sized, came with a little tweezer holder, and were just short of $12 - so really, a great, great deal. You will not go wrong in purchasing these bad boys.<br /><br />Oh! Also - this company has great customer service. I was sent a thank you and updates on my tweezers by Castle Rock and was urged to contact them if I had any questions, concerns, etc. The emails were personalized and sincere, and that's hard to come by these days!	2015-08-01

If you suffer from dry skin or scalp, listen up. You really want to give Argan Oil a try!<br /><br />I have found the first oil that I can say will always be in my supply rack.<br /><br />Here are the ways we are using it:<br />~ Rubbing just a drop on the ends of our hair stops the frizzy look and feel<br />~ Massaging a couple of drops on any itchy spot – stops the itch immediately<br />~ Rubbing a drop on our cuticles stops the dry splitting areas from catching and pulling<br />~ Adding a couple of drops to bath water helping with overall dry skin flaking<br /><br />The only thing that I didn’t love about the product was the initial scent. Not that it is bad, just different. And it fades quickly so that isn’t really a problem either.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.	2015-08-01

Thanks to Batiste dry shampoo, I'm able to continue perpetuating the lazy millennial lifestyle that every other generation stereotypes me as, by not washing my hair everyday--or even every other day for that matter! It does an acceptable job of keeping the grease at bay from my already dull-looking hair, preventing me from looking like a homeless person trying to pass as a business professional in an attempt to get free coffee from the company's generic Keurig.<br /><br />I've used several dry shampoos from the Batiste line and this is their most pleasing scent by far. To me, their &#34;Fresh&#34; scent smells like straight-up-now-tell-me Lysol, &#34;Cherry&#34; smells like cancer and &#34;Blush&#34; smells like a douche, and I'm not talking about the word douche as a euphemism for Donald Trump, I'm talking about a literal cleansing douche. Unless &#34;Strength & Shine&#34; is an odor now, this particular scent is elusively unnamed. It smells somewhat masculine, which I like, but is also oddly feminine. If Tilda Swinton came out with a fragrance, this would be it. Totes.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's a good dry shampoo, for the price, and doesn't leave behind a lot of white residue. I gave it four stars because they are liar-liars-with-their-pants-on-fire due to fact that it doesn't make/keep my hair shiny. I want my pink shirt back! I also cannot attest to the strength claim; but let's keep it real, what kind of psycho hose beast has the time or resources to test that assertion? Well-executed marketing ploy, Batiste, well-executed.	2015-08-01

The quality is fantastic! I can never wait to open the bottle. My daughter even asks for the bottle lid (we put the dropper in and leave it because we use the oil so often) and keeps the lid in a little box so she can smell it whenever she wants to. I use at least 7 to 8 drops of lavender per day, and 3 or 4 drops on my kids box fan. It really has helped them sleep at night. One of the kiddos used to stay up all night long when she could, which made for a grouch all day. Finally one night when she was still up at 5:30 AM, I came and brought her a few drops of lavender as a &#34;medicine&#34; to put on her pillow and help her sleep. A few sniffs and she settled down to fall asleep. Now she gets the drops on her box fan every night so the whole room smells of lavender. I absolutely cannot do without a big bottle of lavender in the house, and majestic pure never disappoints!<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE (TO TRY) AND LEAVE AN UNBIASED AND HONEST REVIEW.

However, white this toothpaste I get the same results without the sensitivity. Plus it's easy to remember to whiten because you aren't going to forget to brush your teeth.

This is good for blending on into your face as you put on your make up or foundation for hiding blemishes. But didn't work for me. Not for big pimple like I have a very persistent one that like to grow big.<br /> For a background, I always have a one and only zit anywhere on my face almost every month<br />for as long as I can remember. I thought this one would give me a quick heal of the problem (particularly this month!) like I was hoping. I'm a proactive user as of the moment for  say 2-3 yrs now, it doesn't even work for me a hundred percent but I still use it. It does keep my face smoother. But it doesn't get rid of my zit that comes after or before my period. And that is what I'm looking for, something that is not for the entire face but something that would stop or prevent my pimple to become big. I don't have this small<br />stubborn pimples that others like to get rid of, but my problem is this one that would turn into big zit on my face and last like 8--10 days of giving me an embarrassment when I go out but I really need to to pick up my kids or do errands for example that I just suck it up and ignore the looks from people. Though im so tired of it coz it's embarrassing! But what can I do.<br />Sorry that this product is not working for me so I'm going to say I just keep on looking.<br />I don't always give reviews but I want to share my disappointment. Maybe it works for others Quick! But not for all!<br />This picture was taken last Friday and we went out to pizza dinner with my In laws and this review is today is Friday and it is still big. I didn't want to come but then again I just have to. The third picture shown was taken after a week and you can see it is still big.<br />I kept on putting the end-zit several times a day and to no avail, I just wait for it to heal on its own. Oh well.	2015-08-01

First of all, the taste... at first I could not figure out what it was, but the closest thing I could think of was raw daikon radish, with a small lingering minty-ness. Not off putting in any way, but it's certainly an interesting experience compared to the hoards of green and blue colored 'just shoved a bunch of altoids in your mouth' tasting liquids you see when you walk by the oral hygiene section. It seriously helps with bad breath and it doesn't just mask the smell with a peppermint bomb explosion in your mouth like most mouthwashes seem  to do. As far as something you're going to put in your mouth for a minute end up spitting out, this is on the pricier side, which is the only negative thing about it. But I don't know if I could justify the cost, so I would probably alternate between this and some Listerine.	2015-08-01

It left my hair extremely soft and manageable after just simple towel drying and a little bit of hair dryer use. I've been trying to use less styling tools this summer (i.e. flat iron) and this styling gel allows me to get away with not using these tools. I simply run some of the product through my hair after showering and use a little bit of a hair dryer to get rid of soaking wet hair. My hair is ready for a quick pony tail. It looks and remains smooth and soft, without frizziness or lots of flyaway hair. Highly recommend this product. I will be buying it in the future.	2015-08-01

I am usually left disappointed with products like this, not this time!  I have very fine, slightly wavy with a little frizz hair.  It usually has absolutely no body.  I tried this stuff on a whim, and I'm pleasantly surprised.  My hair looks much fuller, and doesn't fall flat.  I spritzed several sprays on freshly washed, damp hair and combed it through.  I then used Sally's generic version of Kenra blowdry spray and Ion dry oil spray.  I blow dried my hair, upside down, and flat ironed the few stray pieces.  I finished it off with Sally's generic version of Kenra hair spray.  My hair looks at least twice as full as usual, and didn't fall flat all day.  I don't know if it's the combination of products, but I'm very happy with the results.	2015-08-01

In fact, I almost gave it one star because I was so disappointed in the product. First of all, it says it's for dry skin. I have combination skin that is occasionally dry. Let me also add that I have nice skin. I just need something when my skin is dry. This product might work well for some. The cleanser dried my skin out. The moisturizing serum did nothing. Not sure if it dried my skin or if it just did not moisturize after the cleanser dried me out. The hydrating sunscreen, which I was really the most interesting in, was just ok. The moisturizer is definitely not for someone with dry skin. Basically, this did not even moisturize the areas of my skin that can be oily. On the plus side, nothing made me break out.	2015-08-01

(Warning--Loreal has a &#34;Frost and Glow&#34; kit, but it's NOT the same, which I learned the hard way.)  This Revlon kit doesn't leave your hair brassy, just nice and golden.  But some tips from someone with dark brown hair who's had happy results with this kit for a couple of years now:<br /><br />--Don't use the pick and cap thing--you can't get close enough to the roots.  Instead, just use an old toothbrush to apply the highlight solution anywhere the sun would normally hit your hair.  Apply the solution first where you want the most highlights because 5 minutes or more could pass before you get all the solution applied, so those areas you work on first will have the solution on longer than the rest of your hair.<br /><br />--Don't forget the back of your hair!  Hold up a hand mirror to a wall mirror to stroke the highlight solution on the back of your hair wherever the sun would normally hit.<br /><br />--This kit makes a LOT of solution--you won't use it all, so don't be tempted to!  Don't apply highlights underneath your hair or wherever the sun wouldn't hit it.  If you do, it won't look natural.<br /><br />--I apply highlights, set a timer for 10 minutes, then wash and blowdry my hair to see how it looks.  If I want more highlights, I apply more solution, let it set for 10 minutes, then wash and dry again..  Just let the solution sit (it will foam up in the tray--that's okay) until you know you don't need it anymore.<br /><br />btw, the shampoo and conditioner included in the kit is fabulous...your hair will feel like silk.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2015-08-01

It is much heavier, and the bristles, combined with the weight of it, are too hard and gouge my tender scalp.  I prefer vented brushes as they are easier to clean; I don't use them in conjunction with a blow-dryer.  I hope Conair decides to make the rounded, vented, lightweight brush I had for years again, but until then, I found a better replacement, rounded vented head that I wanted, lighter weight, made of bamboo, from another vendor, so this will become a dog brush.  I'm sure they will like it.	2015-08-01

Since I'm also very impatient so I cut it very short.  As in shorter than Jamie Lee Curtis hair cut short. That was not quite enough so I added Lipogaine and Hair Covet  also from Hair Skin Professional.<br />I've been using these two products together for a full month and I have to say I am AMAZED at how much growth I can see. I have so much silver showing now I'm amazed!!! My hair is fuller, thicker and growing so fast!!!! Even my hairdresser commented on how fast my hair is growing!!<br />To use just move the dropper around on your scalp, then massage into the scalp. Do this twice a day; once when I wake up and once before bed. It doesn't have a strong scent and by the time it dries it has no scent.<br />This one bottle will last for a full month and two doses a day.<br />This didn't effect the color treated portion of my hair,but if I was still coloring my hair I'd would say I am WELL past the need a touch up phase!<br />I am thrilled with this product and so thankful I was given a bottle to try for the purpose of this review.	2015-08-01

Professional hair cuts at home	I give hair cuts to all of my family members, and this started mostly because I was tired of paying $15 every couple months to keep my husbands hair in check. I watched how they did his hair, and went home with a pair of dollar store hair scissors and tried out a hair cut. It looked pretty good. I kept giving him hair cuts, which now people mistake as him getting a professional cut, but my scissors were wearing out and breaking every few months. That cost adds up. They are also not very sharp and often pull the hair a bit. I tried the equinox scissors out and I am amazed at the difference! These scissors are nicely weighted, not too light like the dollar store ones, and they are professional just like our old stylist used to use on everyone. The only down side is the finger holes are not big enough for my husband to use, but my fingers fit perfectly. So if you are getting a pair, be sure that your fingers are on the smaller side, otherwise equinox has a pair without the black rubber ring that allows bigger fingers to use them (I have a pair of their thinning scissors and his fingers fit just fine)<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

My daughter was playing in her pool the day after I washed her hair in it and I really thought her hair would smell like the chlorine, but when she got out, hair soaked, it still smelled like the shampoo/conditioner. It makes your hair feel so soft as well. I just love it.	2015-08-01

The Pure Vanilla smells good but kind of reminds me of a perfume from the 80's that my aunt wore. Its a little more musky, and musk is not my favorite, but it does have a more expensive perfume smell. The Vanilla Grapefruit has a sweet/citrus scent and I'm looking forward to trying it.	2015-08-01

Please don't confuse &#34;shiny&#34; with &#34;greasy&#34; or &#34;oily&#34; for it is neither greasy or oily. The trick is learn how much you need (which turns-out to be very little) to protect your face and ears. The built-in pump meters-out very small amounts. 4 squirts gives you not quite a quarter-sized glob.. Just enough with a bit left over, which I apply to the back of my neck. I apply it after applying my aftershave lotion and am good for the day. I've slept without washing this off. It does not stain the bed linen.<br /><br />UPDATE+++<br /><br />I am on my second order of two tubes. I've learned that the resultant shininess was due to my simply using too much. With a little experimenting it appears that two squirts (half as much as originally suggested) and applying it more carefully gives me the same protection. Spending a few more minutes rubbing it into the skin also help reduce the shininess I observed when I first began using this product. A case (for me) when more is not better, or even necessary. Now knowing the &#34;disappointment&#34; was my own doing I've changed my overall rating to 5 stars.	2015-08-01

It also is light on the resistance side, but you can put two springs in at a time if you pay attention to what you are doing. This will increase the resistance to a more reasonable level for a man. My wife uses just one spring and that works fine for her. There are no quick fixes; you didn't obtain the loss of muscle tone in a week or a month and you won't correct the problem in a short time frame. This is still like any other workout routine; you must set a schedule and stick to it if you want too achieve any lasting results. You must also continue the routine after you achieve the results or you will regress to where you were. We have been using this device for a little over three weeks and can already see small improvements but we both realize it will take months of use to get the results we seek. I am a former bodybuilder and my wife is just a gorgeous woman who has had to do very little to maintain her looks. We are in our late 50s now and while we both still pass as early 40s we see signs of growing older and this little device is helping us regain the healthy looks to which we are accustomed. Plus we have converted a room of our house into a gym and are both back into body building, albeit at a much lighter level. So buy this gadget if you plan to use it diligently and you will eventually get the results you seek. If you aren't willing to put in the time and effort necessary to achieve the results, save your money and do nothing.	2015-08-01

I had to have it as soon as I saw it. I have an olive skin tone, and these colors make me look sick. While the pigmentation of most of these eyeshadows are good, a few are chalky and have lots of fall out. I do like the shade &#34;blackout&#34; for a smokey liner effect. This product is also very overpriced. If I do use this palette it's only for one shadow or two, if I create a whole eye look just from this palette, my eyes look too pink. I won't repurchase. I would only recommend this product to makeup artists since there are not many rose gold-toned palettes out there.	2015-08-01

You're free to use it pretty much anywhere on your body and you do it on YOUR own time.<br />The only set back in my expectations of it is that due to safety features (needed of course) you're unable to access smaller areas because the laser must make full contact with the skin so it doesn't emit harmful light to parts/or unwanted areas for laser hair removal.<br />OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT! 😊	2015-08-01

The five blade razor shaved the same width as my regular razor, however the blades seemed spaced closer together. The razor rinsed out easily, that along with no need for shaving cream makes for a quick shave for this razor. My favorite application of it is to shave my armpits in the sink when there is just no time to hop in the shower. It's also wonderful for shaving legs what ever the senario. I never had a problem with razor rash using this, which is typically a bit off an issue for me. The shave gel bars were a bit bulky at first, so the first few times I ever used it, I did have trouble with my bikini line, just getting the razor where I needed it was a little awkward so I ended up going back per the same areas with old razor. Still no shaving cream was needed then! The built in shave gel bars come off thick when the razor is fresh. I also noticed that I did not get as close of a shave as I am accostomed to using what I consider regular pressure, because of the way they razor slid atop the thick layer of shave gel. After using it a few different times that was no longer an issue. I had to get used to a different feel of the razor in my hand, change my technique a little, and the shave gel did not come off quite as think after the first few uses. After many uses the shave gel bars are almost gone. Now that they are thin and don't touch as great an are of my skin I think I will continue to use the razor for a bit as a normal razor with my regular shaving cream as the blades are still sharp and not yet needing to he replaced. Other people might not run in to this senario, I feel tht I rinsed off a lot of the gel bars just rinsing my hair out of the razor, however I have very thick hair. Overall this has given me the best shave experience, no razor burn, no need for additional shaving cream, less overall time spent shaving with this! The vanilla creme scent was hardly noticeableto me, so I can definitely say it was not over powering or unpleasant. The razor stick also came with a suction cup shower hook, I loved how petite it was, however I current don't keep my razor in the shower so it is of no use to me.	2015-08-01

Also I've needed to keep using it for about three weeks to see the difference, but it has made a clear difference.  Note that you have to use it regularly if you'd like to keep them enhanced.  This lash enhancer needs to be applied only before you go to bed.  Also next morning you might notice a whitish membrane like substance where you applied it.  It's a residual substance after it dried and when you wash your face, it would disappear as it is water-soluble.  Also it's worked for my eyebrows as well.	2015-08-01

I have one toe with a nail fungus on it. It is embarrassing trying to wear sandals in the summer, and I don't like to paint my toenails. A couple of years ago I had a fungus on my big toe and the doctor prescribed  antifungal tablets to take for six months. I was told it was bad for your liver, so I only took it a couple of months and used some prescription antifungal  cream on my toe at the same time. It finally went away and now I am faced with another toe with the  dreaded toenail fungus.<br /><br />I was very happy to see this over the counter Nail Fungus Treatment, since I don't want to go to the doctor or have my toenail removed. I am very hopeful that this Nail Fungus Treatment will work on my toe. On the package, there are no directions for using the Nail Fungus Treatment other than wash and dry the area before applying. It doesn't tell you how many times a day or how much to apply,  so I have been applying it twice a day. The active ingredient is Undecylenic acid (15%), which is used as a topical antifungal agent. I have not experienced any burning, itching or stinging by using the Nail Fungus Treatment.<br /><br />It is very important that you wash your nails each time very well and dry them before you apply the Nail Fungus Treatment. You need to continue treating your nail and trim off the infected nail until the infection is eliminated. Depending on your nail, you may need to use this topical nail treatment for up to six months, hopefully you will see improvements within one to three months.<br />I will update in a month on my nail progress.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-01

May not be the same for everyone though, due to different situations that may happen during the delivery. But the product is very good (so far to me). It's not a thick material, and the letters and picture look great. There are some creasings in the fabric itself due to the way it was folded to package but those will come out in time with wearing the mask and what not. I really don't have any complaints about this product. After a while I may update this review as its used more and I can really see how good it is, but so far I'm in love. :D	2015-08-01

I've had my for over a year and LOVE it. Being an asthmatic I have to be extremely careful with the scents I have in my environment. Though I love sweetly scented candles, they can sometimes make my asthma flare. This diffuser is a god send. Delivering whatever blends of natural oils I choose into the air it not only doesn't upset my asthma but soothes my body and mind. This tool makes for a great way to explore aromatherapy. Since it is diffused with water you don't have to worry about open flames of the oils being changed by heat.<br />Some of my personal favorite blends are:<br />Lavender + Peppermint (before bend or to relax)<br />Eucalyptus + Peppermint ( to soothe stress)<br />Clove Oil + Eucalyptus +Lemon + Cinnamon + Rosemary ( for when I'm under the weather)<br /><br />Whether you are looking for a natural way to scent your home, or a way to explore the wonderful world of aromatherapy this is a fantastic product.	2015-08-01

The actual bleach worked quickly and efficiently. I picked this product because it has a 40 volume developer and that is what salons have used on me in the past. The parts of my hair that had been bleached previously turned snow white and would have almost looked good without any type of toner. The regrowth in my hair was harder to bleach and did turn brassy. I did have a few problems with this product, however, and that is why I am only giving it three stars. I have thick, coarse hair that is a few inches below my shoulders. I used the highlighting cap and utilized all of the holes in the cap. The main issue I had with this product was that there was not enough bleach! If I had chosen to bleach all of my hair, I would've needed at least four kits to have enough product to do so. I still didn't have enough product to cover all of the hair that I needed done, so I focused the bleach on the top parts. This was extremely frustrating because I wasn't able to do the best job I could have done. If you have even slightly more hair than the average person, I would recommend getting two kits or buying the items separately. This kit ended up disappointing me. I was not expecting salon quality results, but I was expecting to have enough product to cover the 1/5 of my hair that I wanted to bleach.	2015-08-01

Sometimes slips out of my hand when I try to brush my hair after having a few too many french fries, but this brush makes taking out knots in your hair easier than any other hairbrush. It also leaves your hair feeling soft, and not frizzy! I have fine, straight hair and it works for me. Bought one for a friend and she enjoys using it as well.

I love this product and I prefer to buy it in the travel sizes for two reasons.  First, so I can easily carry one in my purse, which doesn't need to be any heavier than it already is.  Second, this polish lasts on my nails where most polishes peel or flake within a few days.  So I have to use less of it, less frequently, which is great until the remaining product starts to gel up in the bottle.  I like the smaller size because I can use it all up before it starts to thicken and become difficult to use.	2015-08-01

I have dry skin and thought this would be a good hydrating toner to prep my skin for vitamin c serum. It stripped my skin of all its natural oils so instead I just got a dried out face.

I like it for removing the last traces of makeup before bed after I've used a makeup wipe. It smells soooo good that my nightly beauty routine has changed from being a dreaded ritual to luxury.

I'm happy to have quality Rosehip Oil back in my beauty regime again. I usually apply it in the evenings after dinner (a few hours before bed), to allow the oil to be fully absorbed before I place my face on a pillow, or one can just lightly dab their face with a tissue to get any excess oil off before bedtime. Even though it comes in a tinted glass bottle, I store this oil in a cool dark cabinet to further preserve it's raw delicate qualities. I purchased this product as a promotional sample in return for an honest and objective review.	2015-08-01

So I tried fixin	I had perioral dermatitis after using a prescription topical steroid (for another health issue). My doctor told me that topical steroids shouldn't cause dermititis, but after Googling it I found out I'm not the only one to have that reaction. Unfortunately the dermatitis didn't go away when I stopped using the steroid. It stopped spreading, but the patches around my mouth and nose stayed. My doctor had no recommendation to fix it besides another topical steroid which I tried and only made it worse. So I tried fixing it on my own which lead me to try sooo many things. I tried supplements, water and exercise and healthy diet, going make up free, professional facials, masks, scrubs, washes, treatments, (DIY and store bought), etc. Some things helped a little, but would stop working after bit (like oatmeal and yogurt masks). I had it for almost a year and was losing my mind. Then, during my hundredth internet search, I found a post buried in some obscure forum that recommended Nixoderm. They said it burned bad, but it got rid of their perioral dermatitis. It was pretty cheap and at this point I had nothing to lose but more money so I gave it a go. And, yes, it does burn. The more you massage it in the more it burns. And if your skin condition is really bad it's only going to burn more. But after a week or so of using this the dermatitis was finally gone! I was happy and grateful! That was years ago but I recently started getting little skin colored bumps on my temples and jawline. This did help keep those weird bumps in line, but didn't get rid of them. Since it wasn't curing it I stopped (because it burns a lot for no result) and the bumps turned into red inflamed acne cyst clusters. So painful and ugly! Now at this point this product hasn't helped with the acne. But I have used it before on random pimples and it does help with that. So, for me, this is great for random pimples and perioral dermatitis but not quite for adult acne.	2015-08-01

I never really had any damage (thankfully) until I got my roots retouched by a sloppy stylist who kinda just slapped the bleach on without being careful. When I washed my hair that night, I noticed my hair was extremely gummy. Combing through my wet hair with my fingers, I noticed large chunks breaking off. I was horrified and extremely upset! So I immediately went to Sally's and picked some of this up. After one use, my hair was no longer snapping off in my fingers, and looked much better. I am very happy that this product has allowed me to avoid cutting my hair very short. The only thing is that my hair is still quite fragile, so I expect that I will have to use this product frequently until I am able to brush my hair again without worry. Overall, I recommend this product. It saved my hair but it definitely still has a way to go before it's back to a normal state.	2015-08-01

It is a 2 step process - you use Step 1 toothpaste for one minute as this is your plaque removal process. You DO NOT rinse after Step 1 - you then use Step 2 for one minute as this is the polishing step (then you rinse). Says it will get your teeth up to 6 x's whiter - I only noticed maybe 1-2 x's whiter - if that. I used this system for exactly one month. I brushed twice a day. My likes? Totally fresh breath, very clean when I run my tongue over my teeth, some improvement on whitening, simple to use. My problems with this system? Gets kind of annoying to have to switch using different tubes of toothpaste, no major whitening noted, Step 2 doesn't taste great and it may irritate your gum line w/ the peroxide, I ran out of Step 1 in exactly 30 days and still had plenty of Step 2 so I couldn't do the whole system anymore, not nearly the whitening I was hoping for, I like to brush my tongue and gum line so I'd have to do this separately or with another toothpaste (not with this whitening product), and it's not sold at all stores. It does a great job of giving you a fresh from the dentist clean feeling, but the whitening? So, So.	2015-08-01

Opinions are my own and this is my honest review.  I am impressed with this product.  The ingredients include collagen - that plumps up skin, licorice root extract - to help with dark circles and Vitamins E and A.  It comes well sealed in a bottle that is protected from sunlight and is dispensed using a pump.  The eye cream is white in color, non-greasy and spreads easily.  What I really like is there is no noticeable scent and the eye cream does not cause any sting or discomfort to my skin.  I only need to use a small amount, it absorbs and dries quickly and is not sticky. I apply this in the morning and let it dry, then apply my regular makeup. My makeup goes on smoothly over the eye cream and doesn't feel heavy. I also use this before bed and I like the results I am seeing.

It has a faint, minty scent - which is supposed to be stress relieving. It sinks in nicely, feels great on my skin and doesn't leave any greasy feeling. It's hard to tell how much it is doing as an anti aging product since who knows what I might look like if I wasn't using it. But I seems to keep my skin smooth and fairly wrinkle free. I can't get rid of all of them and no product would be able to do that anyway. I'm 51 and I like the wear marks I carry around to reflect my wisdom. Ha ha.<br /><br />This is a great moisturizer and worth trying to keep aging at bay. Sample provided for review.	2015-08-01

Going tanning is out of the question (paying my hard earned money for skin cancer? No thanks), and I was intimidated by the various spray tans, spray mousses, and other products out there that deliver some serious darkness (and you need to apply them with a &#34;mitt&#34;...I'm too low maintenance for that). I didn't want to walk into work the day after a self-tanning session with everyone asking me &#34;How did you get so tan?...It's February&#34;, but I wanted a healthy glow, so I figured finding something that would offer a gradual tan would be my best bet. I also have a rather restrictive budget so I figured this was the perfect choice, at around 11 dollars for a decently large bottle. To top it off, I read all of the raving reviews on this product and thought it would be exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I had read enough reviews on tanning products that I knew the basics of how to use it properly: exfoliate thoroughly in the shower (I use Tree Hut Shea Sugar Scrub...love it), make sure you apply evenly and be careful around knees/elbows/ankles so it doesn't come out uneven, wash hands thoroughly afterwards so you don't spread the brown color everywhere, don't put on clothes for a while so it can all absorb, etc. I followed the instructions carefully every time, and used it religiously every other day for about three weeks.<br /><br />At the end of the three weeks, I was rather disappointed. Although this makes for a great moisturizer and smells great (hence the two stars), my &#34;tan&#34; was virtually nonexistent. I was just as pale as I had been three weeks earlier trudging through the four feet of snow in my driveway. So if you're like me and you're looking for a gradual tan that will give you a nice glow, I suggest you keep looking. If you're just looking for a good moisturizer in a lovely pumpbottle, by all means buy this one.	2015-08-01

I was offered the opportunity to purchase this item at a promotional rate for review purposes so I jumped at the chance.  I figured it would be a good way to ease her in to straightening her hair at a great price.  This is a really nice entry level flat iron.  It doesn't have an automatic shut off or temperature settings that you would find on higher end flat irons but it works quite well.  It gets hot enough to straighten her thick hair with ease.  I like that the plates are ceramic as they seem to be less damaging to your hair and I think they last longer.	2015-08-01

I also trie to do my roots with a permanent color, and I got splotches.  I did some internet research and they all recommended demi color for less damage if i wanted to go darker.  This was recommended as it was one stop shop and no mixing required.  I purchased the deep warm brown.  I applied it to individual stands and processed it according to the package time.  I didn't even use foil and it looked nice!  It broke up the blonde so I have streaks in my hair and freshened my highlights!  Love this product.

However a back bar rubs the roller during use = annoying.	Fine as replacement heads. I have hard time tellng if there is any real difference in performance between the so called grit sizes. I clean mine with a SOFT or EXTRA soft tooth brush after every use. I just remove and brush down into the bath sink and then wash any dust on down the drain. I also place a thick bath mat or towel on floor before using these in the machine. This avoids dust getting ground into your carpets or spread about the room as much too. I almost went with a cheaper brand because the rollers are larger and there is no annoying back support or elongated back side that gets in the way of the rollers when you press a bit too much or actually very little at times while in use. But I didn't and went with this and bought the gray so called man's machine. The mini palm sized version...these rollers fit the longer versions too. Anyway I am satisfied with the rollers but see no difference between them in actual use. Maybe some looking at them but they all seem to do the same exact job and results. If you clean them with the tooth brush after every use you should get far more uses out of each roller than if you choose not to. My guess is like 2 maybe 3 times more use per roll. I also use the tooth brush always SOFT to clean the flat pedi file like paddles too and I had one of the better ones last me over 2 years. Sometimes the cheaper ones give up the glue to the board sooner...but look for an extra soft or even ask you dentists office if they have the super soft or soft brushes next time you visit. I'm happy overall with the refills and the machine except that back bar that occasionally rubs the rollers....that is annoying...and because of that the one star off.	2015-08-01

To add to my problem	This is the first time writing a comment, on a product.  I always had thick hair, lots of shedding over the years.  I thought it was due to  the relaxers I used for so many years.  My hair was thining and shedding at an amazing rate. To add to my problem, I began graying which added another chemical to my damage hair.I decided to give  n&eacute;em, shikakai, Aritha and Amla a try.  I began this journey May 30 2015., I trim my hair, off approximately 3 inches.  I had my hair in a proactive style,(braids) for two months.  I noticed my hair grew 1.5 inches in first month.  I removed the braid, my hair grew but The most amazing thing. I noticed the shedding, decreased, vertually stopped, just a few strands of hair in the Comb.  The mixture is messy but it is worth it.  My mixture  consist of Amla powder, neem powder, shikakai powder,  Aretha powder mixed about 1 tsp full of each, in Amal oil and coconut oil.  Combined all together in a paste.  Part your hair into  four sections and apply the mixture to your hair.  Leave on for 45-60 mins; rinse your hair well in the shower work best. Use a shampoos of your choice to remove the excess power and residue.  My hair is soft and managable.  Hope this information helps.  I plan on using weekly, for the next year..	2015-08-01

This works just as good as Neutrogena's Oil Free Acne Stress Control, without all of the chemicals. I'm almost 30 and started to question why I was still washing my face with acid. I figured it was time to get away from the acne washes. My face feels clean and fresh after using this. I use it once a day (in the morning) and use Cetaphil before bed so as not to over-irritate. Good for back, chest, really anywhere that is oily. It's a potent cleanser--a little goes a long way. If I use 2 pumps with a foamer every day, this bottle will probably last me until I'm 60. In my opinion, you have to use this with a simple, cheap foamer. I washed one from my old face washes out and have been re-using it and it works perfectly. If you don't use a foamer, you're just going to be wasting it.<br /><br />Positive: Cheap considering how long it will last. No chemicals, but I'm not an expert on that. I mean, I figure it has to have less than the other crap I've used. It cleans my skin really well without making it chapped, dry, flaky, etc. Actually, I think the Cetaphil for oily skin is more drying than this is.<br /><br />Negative: While it doesn't dry my skin out, it is potent, and you shouldn't over-do it with this. 2 pumps with a foamer.<br /><br />Neutral: It does make my face a little red. It's not a chapped or irritated red, it's literally just like my skin is a little flushed after I use it. Your milage may vary.	2015-08-01

A drop test, which tests the purity of essential oils, proved that the myrrh oil in this package is not pure. In a drop test, a true essential oil will evaporate completely, leaving no trace. The myrrh left an oily stain, meaning it's been mixed with another oil. However the frankincense tested pure. When I contacted the company, they expressed surprise and gratitude for bringing the problem to them, and said they'd look into their supplier, which means at least they're on top of it, as opposed to other companies who just insist their product is pure when it isn't'. That's why I gave them three stars instead of one, on the off chance that the impure oil was not their fault, but the fault of their supplier.	2015-08-01

After a few weeks of using it every night on my finger, the swelling has reduced and I can wear my wedding ring again! I highly recommend, just remember you only need a few drops 😊	2015-08-01

My 1st impression of this razor was favorable, I like the look of it and really like the black satin finish. It has a nice heft to it and is comfortable in my hand compared to a few other DE's I've used. After going through my normal straight razor face prep I lathered up and started my shave. I'll admit my DE technique is lacking especially since it's been awhile since I've used one. It didn't matter, this is a very smooth shaving razor. The weight is distributed right wear it needs to be. The weight of the head is near perfect in my opinion, I didn't need any pressure on my shaving strokes other than just the weight of the head. The handle provides a nice grip even when wet so no issues there either. I had a very nice 2 pass shave without any nicks or cuts that left my face smooth, didn't need to go 1 more pass or even touch any spots up. For those who say that it's only the blade that gives you a smooth clean shave I beg to differ. Try using a DE that has little to no weight in the head or the weight is not distributed correctly, then tell me it's just the blade, The razor makes all the difference and this one does just what it should. After shaving I cleaned the razor and looked closely at the finish as some of the reviews stated the black finish &#34;washed&#34; off or whatever, Not on mine, looks just as good as it did when I opened the box. I will keep using this razor, it won't be my daily shaver as I still like my straights too much but I can guarantee you it's not going to be collecting dust on a shelf. My conclusion is this is a very nice razor at a very affordable price, I do recommend it.	2015-08-01

This face wash is wonderful! I am a 36 year old who still deals with occasional acne. I also have very oily skin. Here's how I use this...First, I exfoliate my face to get off any dead skin cells. This helps to fully cleanse my face. Then, I apply this wash all over my face & get up a good foam. Then I use water & rub my face with my hands for a couple minutes or I gently use my konjac sponge. Finally, I rinse thoroughly. It foams up nicely like I said, & doesn't dry out my face. After I wash, I follow up with an oil free moisturizer. I use this product daily & it has really helped control my acne. I hardly get any blemishes anymore! I highly recommend this face wash. I was given a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.	2015-08-01

This one is the first hydro sol I ever used. Like everyone else using for the first time, I too thought that this might be having the same smell as lavender essential oil, but since this a hydro sol, it doesn't have the smell of lavender. It has a very different smell.<br />After some research I got to understand that hydrosols smell different than essential oil.<br />I let this hydrosol cool in the refrigerator overnight and the next day after a hot and sunny day outside, I had some red sunburns and I used this cool hydrosol as a spray and it felt so good! It immediately relieved all my sunburns and it felt as if my body temperature was lowered immediately by this application. Though I wasn't a big fan of its smell, it definitely has great properties and I am going to continue using it for various purposes.<br />I received this at a discounted price for my honest unbiased review and opinion.	2015-08-01

Beauty	5	8	8	N	Y	If your super pale and want to hide circles I'd recommend this one!	The first one of these I had got dropped and the plastic lids broke so I kept it in a baggie. A lot ended up being wasted. So now I keep my new one in it's package. I also keep it in the fridge to keep it cooler. This really does a wonderful job concealing. I use the yellow first then kinda blend it with the nude color. I put a little of that on the rim of my cheeks under my eyes too and a little on my nose. It feels so cool and helps the morning puffiness plus wakes me up a little. It takes VERY little blending with my fingers. Doesn't really look like make up. Usually even with other physicians formula concealer I have to use so much to get this result you can see the make up. I also a little of their pink brightening concealer and colored powder. It all looks smooth and nice. I happen to be really fair and make up tends to look bolder on me if I'm not careful but this just works perfectly. I've always struggled to hide my circles. This has proven to be my perfect concealer. Like some have mentioned it can be hard to get the right amount. I always shake it first. Sometimes I have to roll it for a while before anything comes out. Its worth it though for me since it works so well on me. 😀	2015-08-01

My poor young daughter was blessed with course and easy to tangle hair.  She is nearly seven and we have been trying all sorts of detanglers out there and none actually did anything more than wet the hair down and scent it.<br /><br />This is different.  I know this is a leave in conditioner but please you need to try it off label as a detangler!!!  I just put it in a spray bottle and put it in her hair after a bath on wet hair, or on dry hair while I am styling it.  It works equally as well on both wet and dry hair.<br /><br />She has naturally curly/wavy hair and Infusium sort of separates and defines her curls. Somehow it adds body (So it does not weight the hair down at all) and now receives compliments on how her hair shimmers. (No glitter or oilyness, just natural shimmer) where as before it was dull.<br /><br />She is a swimmer and goes to swimming lessons and such in a chlorinated pool for nearly four hours a week.  This stuff keeps her hair strong and healthy looking. I even use it in my hair because it adds natural shimmer and body.  We have been using it for several months now and there is no need to try another type of product.	2015-08-01

This set comes in a thick plastic bag, but also includes a canvas bag for storage.<br /><br />The tweezers themselves are very sturdy and have a good weight in your hand. Both sets are very well aligned and I had no issue grasping or pulling my very thin eyebrow hair. Before these, I had one pair of tweezers I looked out of the ten or so I've tried over the years. I found both to be of a longer length than most other tweezers and this made them easier to handle.<br /><br />I've only used these to pull unwanted hair so far, but I have no doubt the very thin pair will be my go to to remove my next splinter. With that said, that pair is quite sharp and requires great care to not stab yourself with them. They come capped with a plastic tip, but they easier perforated both it and the canvas bag. I would recommend keeping these away from children and storing in a hard case.	2015-08-01

It definitely could use some more abilities to attain a higher level of trimming.

Does not hold enough of a charge to do more than one complete trimming which is very annoying to say the least.

When this product is applied it feels pretty warm on your skin, hence the name hot jelly cream. Another nice thing about this cream is that it doesn't have that weird smell like Ben Gay and various other creams have.  It's sort of like a minty smell and is quite pleasant.

I can't really tell how well it worked until the next morning when it looked like maybe half the fibers had fallen out.<br /><br />I did get a good style with this and it held pretty well.  I'm not a big fan of the scent though.  I'm kind of on the fence about this thing.  I definitely will not be using this unless I am also using the nonagon though even though it does keep my hair in place better than just using some lotion.	2015-08-01

As far as &#34;deodorizing&#34; oils go, this is one heck of a slam dunk. I share a house with two of my buddies and needless to say, it can get a tidbit smelly around the house. I bought a couple essential oil diffusers to help make it smell a little more &#34;women friendly&#34; and while I have found plenty of oils that can help mask the smell, this is the only one that seems to truly deodorize the air.<br /><br />I also mixed up some actual deodorant to try it out and it worked really well. I didn't use the recipe they provided, I just went all mad scientist and mixed a couple carrier oils, water, and this and it worked for the entire day. I wasn't sure if maybe I just didn't notice so I asked my buddies and my girlfriend and everyone said I didn't smell at all.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really awesome oil and would recommend it to anyone. I was lucky enough to be given a discount because they are changing their labeling and we're trying to get rid of the old stock but even at the full price, this is worth it 100%.<br /><br />Also, if you're new to Plant Therapy products, you should know that they are very high quality and are quickly becoming one of my favorite oil manufacturers.	2015-08-01

[[VIDEOID:cc0246ef87a67b055c350512bd2ecdba]] I am simply in love with Lifetart essentials. This is a wonderful lip balm set. It comes with 7 different lip balms that are worlds apart and are named perfectly to fit them. All of the balms are smooth and organic so you know you aren't getting any chemicals. You can smell the scent but it doesn't have a taste to it which is something I enjoy. It also stays on your lips and keeps them nice and moisturized without having to reapply. Now to name the different types. We have Heavenly which is blueberry scented and it's a nice scent and it feeling like I have a bowl of blueberries in front of me which is just heavenly like the name suggests. Next up is Soulful which is brown sugar scented and you can really smell the sweetness of this it reminds me of sugar cookies which also reaches into my soul and brings back memories. Then there is Charming which is a french vanilla and wow you can really smell the vanilla it's strong but nice which is absolutely charming. Following that is Spirited which has an orange scent which to my surprise isn't strong like I imagined but it is delightful and it makes you feel alive and spirited. Lovely is the another one they have that is a cherry scent I personally don't smell the scent too much, but I still see where it's name comes in because it's so light that it is lovely. Next up is Peaceful which is melon scented and I really enjoy this one you can really smell the melon and it usually makes me crave the wonderful fruit and it's name peaceful is just that you just feel relaxed and at piece by the scent. Last up we have Wild which is a key lime scent which reminds me of pie. It has a nice strong lime scent that is heavenly! Wild is the perfect name for it because it is a scent that makes you want to move. Overall I am highly impressed with the quality of these lip balms. This is a great 7 piece set that you won't be let down. I purchased this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

I've been trying to get into more perfumes oils lately instead of sprays because it's better for you in general.. and there is something so beautiful about applying a perfume oil in a gorgeous bottle that looks like it was made for Indian royalty. I will say the Krishna Musk scent is slightly on the 'masculine' side but still a lovely one if you enjoy musk. To be honest if you like the scent you should wear it despite your gender. Anyways, the scent does last a good 4 hours or so before it fades, but you can still smell it faintly for many hours after that. One negative though is that there seems to be no projectivity (meaning, the scent doesn't really permeate) So if you're looking for a scent where you walk in and everyone can smell your perfume this isn't for you. Also, you really get a tiny amount of product. But that's with basically all perfume oils, since it's meant to be a higher concentration you don't need a lot.	2015-08-01

So many possibilities! Plates are etched deep and produce crisp lines. Good deal/quality for the price as good as other name brand plates. The pouch/case it comes with is a nice bonus for those on the go, just starting out, or OCD about keeping collections together.<br /><br />Only negative is that I had to file down the backside (even though there is a protective backing) because about 17 of the plates were very sharp underneath, cutting a few of my fingers when I was trying to remove them from the case. The other plates were ok--maybe this was a batch defect? It was smooth after the filing with 100 grit sandpaper. Edges were nice & rounded.	2015-08-01

I have been using it for a couple of weeks and really, as some other people have said, I wonder how the high-priced gadgets like it can be much better?  I am 75 years old and have milia (little hard white bumps) all over my face plus deep lines as well as finer ones.  I saw an improvement right away, but checked with my daughter to see what she though.  She said my color was  brighter and more uniform, no more dark spots.  Roughness is gone.  The top layer of skin over the milia gradually gets abraded away, and they either come out on their own or with just a bit of scratching or rubbing (be gentle!).  The deep lines really are shallower, because the outer layers of essentially dead skin are gone.<br /><br />I was just looking at the reviews, thinking maybe there was something even better, but now am convinced I won't need to look further.  Some of the suggestions in the reviews are helpful, too.  The thing I do to save money on the refill scrubbers is just set it somewhere to dry for the day and then use it again in the shower, so I get two uses.  I suppose eventually I'll catch some dread disease, but so far, so good, and I don't think I'm in any danger.<br /><br />If you are wondering whether this type of thing works, try this one.  It has such a low price, and I've never heard anyone was hurt by one...	2015-08-01

I've had it for 6 months and never really had any complaints. It was incredible compact, decently powerful, and lasted about 5 days per full charge. I always charged it between 5-7 hours per the instructions. Yesterday, after a full charge, I unplugged it and left it on my counter. In the morning I woke up to see that something inside had exploded/burst. !?!?! That doesn't seem normal. Or safe.  UPDATE: bought a second unit just to see if the first unit I received was just defective. It worked decently well (again) for 7 months and then lo and behold, it blew up again. Exact same scenario only this time the busted open device left an oil stain on my carpet.	2015-08-01

I'm guessing it's much less expensive for companies to use Chinese labor, but I'd really think a higher-end product line would not cheap out and make the product in the USA.

The only thing I have a problem with is that it is hard to remove.  I have tried two different waterproof eye makeup removers.  I have maybeline and Neutrogena.  If anyone can give me some hints, I would appreciate it.  It takes some of it off but leaves some mascara left at the tips of the lashes.  Also, the reason I purchased waterproof is because after a day of work, I look like a raccoon.  Well, this still runs a little but not as much as non-waterproof mascaras.  I like it because I know it is natural and that is most important to me.	2015-08-01

I had read good reviews of this product but was disappointed that the darkest shade in the pan applied much lighter on the eye. Also, the darkest purple shade applies quite sheer and requires quite a bit of effort to get a suitably dark application. This is despite my packing on the powder onto my eye crease. The lighter shades are better, especially the lightest shade. It goes on quite smoothly with good colour application. Overall, if considering this or the Quartz collection quad, I would recommend the Quartz quad as the dark shade applies very smoothly and is quite buttery in texture and application. I certainly would not re-purchase this unless I was looking for matte taupe colours, of which the mid tone colours would be fit. I also expected better colour payoff and easier application. Also, after 1.5 weeks, the powder is crumbling in some of the pans. Not sure if this is because I got an old pan or just the quality of the eyeshadow.	2015-08-01

I bought this product since I saw it on a youtube razor review.  I've found it to be the 2nd best way to wet shave.  To me, Save Secret (http://amzn.to/1KGH8zC) is the King with King of Shaves gel just below.  The only reason it gets 2nd place it because even though it shaves almost as good in every way, I still get cuts with the King of Shaves where I don't with Save Secret.  The only plus King of Shaves has over SaveSecret is the razor rinses off easier.  I find you have to really work to rinse the razor when using Save Secret.	2015-08-01

It leaves my hair shiny and manageable and doesn't make it flat or oily looking. I can also go several without rewashing using this product.

I'm very excited to write this review for those who are looking for a gentle, yet effective whitening system! I was fortunate to receive this product free to try through Crest and BzzAgent. I was so excited to join this campaign to test out this new whitening system! I've used all kinds of whitening strips and gels in the past, and while they work, they would also leave my teeth very sensitive. This Daily cleansing and whitening system has not given me any side effects whatsoever. Even after the first use, your mouth feels sqeaky clean, and already a shade whiter. I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and I'm very pleased with the results! I love that I can use it twice a day with zero sensitivity.<br />The only down side for me, is I have very sensitive gums. It states right on the label that it may leave small white spots on the gums, but that's normal and they will go away. This is true, you will notice that if you have sensitive gums. I have only noticed that reaction though, when I've had a cut from brushing too hard and then it stains that area. It does go away shortly after, however. Just brush gently, and be patient, and you will love the results. Plus, it tastes great! The biggest reason I never whiten with peroxide is because it tastes horrible. The whitening agent in this system is peroxide, but it tastes good! I hope this review helped, I'm glad I gave this whitening system a try! This is a great product!<br />-Melissa	2015-08-01

It takes too long though.  If I put more than two inches of my thin shoulder length hair in then it will either get caught in the chamber or not do a great job. Also, I found that it's not a good idea to go over the same area more than once as it just burns the hair with little curl.  I'm not the only one that had this problem. A friend of mine used it and she freaked out when her hair got stuck.  The key is not to panic but to try and remain calm and GENTLY untangle your hair out of it. That is much easier said than done when your hair is smoking and tangled up.	2015-08-01

I purchased this for my underarms, arms, and legs. I use this product about once a month. This product is serious life changing! Shaving has always made my hair grow back thicker, and I hate having to shave everyday.  Although this is a little painful, I still prefer it over anything else. This removes the hair from the root, so hair grows back slower and finer. The special light it has built in is also very useful to catch my small hairs. This also leaves my body SO smooth. It feels like no hair was every there. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this product!! This is a great epilator!! It came with a pack with olay wipes to use before and after epilation.

In fact, at this point, I am still happy to have any hair on my head, let alone a thick mane of hair. I am always on the hunt for shampoos that add volume, and Dove Men+Care Shampoo, with caffeine and \\\"Oxycharge\\\\\" technology, promises to do just that.<br /><br />I have been using the shampoo for more than two weeks, and I can report that Dive Men+Care does add some volume. I don't need to use very much to get plenty of lather, and I just let the shampoo sit on my scalp for two or three minutes before rinsing off.  The caffeine is supposed to promote growth and the oxycharge technology removes oil and residue. The shampoo, which comes in a large 25.4 ounce bottle, has a masculine cologne-like odor.<br /><br />While I am not expecting to have a full head of thick hair, Dove Men+Care does seem to help. I am encouraged by the results, and will continue to use so I can continue to be a major chick magnet."	2015-08-01

I used it again and repeated what I had done before.  More rust.  This thing rusts pretty easily.  I definitely would not recommend these to anyone.  Rusting issue aside, it cuts pretty well.

I have never been good at trying to hold a round brush in one hand, the hair dryer in the other hand, and trying not to get the brush tangled in my hair all at the same time.

It has a button at the top which controls the direction you want the Spin Styler to turn.  The bristles of the brush are anti-static which is really great for fine hair which tends to flyaway.

That was really appreciated because I have never owned a brush of this nature.<br /><br />Presentation was nice. The brush to me is appealing. I love the color and smooth finish of this brush. It is well-crafted, oval shaped, and comes in a nice black color. The brush came in a nice cloth bag with a draw sting making it easy to store, keep track of, and travel. The bristles are nice, firm, and soft. They weren’t those prickly bristles that sting during use.<br /><br />I was a little taken back by the smell this brush has. It is not too strong, however, it is noticeable. Also, there were some loose bristles in the bag. I did run the brush back and forth over my hand several times and I even pulled at the bristles there was no shedding. So I am thinking the few that are present, happened during packaging.<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-01

The clippers have a very nice feel and heft when holding it. The clippers are very sharp and makes a clean cut. It also doesn't take much pressure to squeeze the clippers. I would highly recommend this product over the inexpensive clippers that you can find in dollar stores or found in gift packages that see every holiday season. The only con and this is basically a personal preference is that I find the cutting edge a little too curved for my tastes. I like my nails cut close to the top of the finger and the curved cutting edge is a little too much. To be fair, it's not just these clippers, but this seems to be true in most all other fingernail clippers that I have come across. If it was a little less curvy, I would definitely give it five stars. See it next to my &#34;cheap&#34; generic clipper in my photo.	2015-08-01

I just received this product in the mail today and could not wait to try it! I have always have difficulties finding a moisturizer I felt good about due to having combination skin. Some areas of my face are prone to hormonal acne and other areas are dry and red. I have literally tried everything from Proactive (which I found to be way too harsh) to just straight coconut oil (which still made my face feel oily). I've tried numerous regimens over the last few months and have spent countless amounts of money on various different products trying to find &#34;the one&#34;. I can honestly say, even though it hasn't even been a day, that I know this product is going to work. I applied it after showering and using my Nuxe face wash and cannot believe how soft my face feels, the best part is it doesn't even feel remotely oily or greasy. I definitely recommend this!!!!!	2015-08-01

It works really great and I love that it has a toothbrush and a waterpik flosser and spots to store the extra flosser heads, as well as the bonus travel case for the toothbrush. I am a big fan of waterpik water flossers and love using them, so I was excited to get this and also have a waterpik brand toothbrush. I really like that it has a feature where it does 30 second intervals for each four quadrants of the mouth and has two speed settings. I also like that the flosser comes with so many different heads, including an orthodontic tip. The reason for knocking out a star is that it is EXTREMELY loud. Now, I have a cordless portable waterpik glossed, as well and that one is very quiet compared this. The water flosser sounds like a very loud machine, and you can hear it throughout the entire house. The toothbrush is loud, too but the flosser is top notch loud. Other than that, they work good and well, it works... so aside from noise, I still like it a lot and it's not enough to make me dislike the product altogether because I do love the brand and how great they work.	2015-08-01

Net Wt 2.0 oz/50ml	Beauty	5	31	36	N	Y	AMAZING!! This cosmetic Guru LOVES this stuff!!	Very fast shipping. I have been using different brands of anti-aging products for many years. I have also had Juvederm ( facial filler) which is a ( hyaluronic acid) filler injected into my face a few years back.  I'm a 38 year old male in the entertainment business.<br /><br />I know my stuff when it comes cosmetics, and the ingredients that SHOULD be in them to help in the Anti-Aging process! first off What is Hyaluronic acid??  It is a substance that is naturally present in the human body, Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and other tissues. having the Vitamins C, A, D & E, in this serum is fantastic.One of the most powerful functions of vitamin C is its role in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. As you age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form. Stabilizing your skin’s levels of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.<br /><br />so do yourselves a favor, stop being indecisive and scared. You found what you are looking for. This company is awesome!!<br /><br />Will the company give me a deal? ;-) just kidding.  because I definitely will be reordering their products.

It also volumizes your lashes, giving them that long full look. I will definitely buy this product again.	2015-08-01

Looking for good clay product.without microbeads	This is not the thick clay mask that I was looking for - it's very thin, watery and higher sulfur content.  I was (still am) looking for the Proactive thick clay mask that used to come in a similar tube however I've been told they replaced it with a new formula. That worked well for me in making my skin smooth and clean.  This product does not and caused a burn like allergic reaction however the good thing is because it's so thin I just tried a tiny bit on a small area just in case.  Most all products in this line I have been sensitive to and had reactions to except the thick clay mask in the tube.<br />Am trying to avoid anything with microbeads (read up on the toxic plastic nightmare microbeads are creating).  Clay works fine and has for many years.  Microbeads are polluting everything including our water and food and the plastics used are known endocrine disruptors.  I'm still looking for a good non mircor bead green clay mask.	2015-08-01

This stuff is amazing. People are complaing of smell. So when you put chemicals on your face you expect it to smell like roses? It smells kimda like the stuff they use for perms. I am used ot that smell since my mother always got perms. I have an unwanted patch of hair on both sides of my face, sort of like sideburns. My husband jokes sometimes that I am elvis. I was waxing it but it was painful and always created bumps. So now I used this and ALL of the hair came off. That was exactly the kind of results I was looking for. I can live with the smell as long as I am getting rid of the hair without any pain. I love this stuff and I will be buying it regularly. Thank you Sally Hanson!!	2015-08-01

I didn't give it 5 stars only because after a certain time, the battery seems to die... However, I must say the customer service offered by Philips Sonicare is superb! They normally cover the battery and will replace it for you. Now back to the toothbrush! It has 5 different settings which is particularly nice if you've just had a cleaning or feel a little sensitive (sensitive setting). It has a cleaning setting which truly massages your gums and I like that. The sterilizing option is also nice since it takes no time at all to run and I feel like it truly works.	2015-08-01

I havent tried a product like this before because I have very sensitive and crooked teeth so I cant use things like the strips or anything that has a mouth plate. The first step tastes a lot like the blue sparkle tooth paste that I used as a kid. You brush for 1 minute with it and spit but do not rinse. This part leaves my mouth feeling rather gross.... Then you apply step 2 for a minute and it tastes like hydrogen peroxide gel. After this step is completed rinse. It's really simple, works really well and it doesnt seem to add any extra time to my morning or nightly routine. The one problem I do have with it is my teeth seem overly sensitive now. I expected that because I have problems with it anyway. Over all the product is worth it. It does a great job and is quick and simple. It's great for people with very crooked teeth like me because it works better than a whitening toothpaste and doesnt need to conform to fit your teeth like strips or mouth plates.	2015-08-01

Best Moisturizer for Hair, Skin, Face, Nails - Essential Wrinkles, Fine Lines & Scars - 2oz	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Put this miracle oil to work for you.	I personally love all the different issues that one oil can treat! Whether someone is dealing with wrinkles, scars, burn marks, or just wants to even out their skin tone, this organic rosehip oil can cover all of it.<br /><br />Because it’s a mild type of oil, I found I can use it directly on my skin without any carrier oil needed. There’s no burning or uncomfortable feeling, even directly on my face. I do have trouble with red areas and dryness on my face, especially during the winter, so I wash my face every morning and then apply the rosehip seed oil. I can usually skip extra moisturizer, unless it’s super cold and I’m going to be spending time outside.<br /><br />I’ve also been using it on a few scars on my knees. I don’t think I’ve been using it long enough to make a visible difference, but my skin is definitely smoother and very soft where I’ve been applying it. Plus, with all the vitamins that are in this oil, I love that my body is getting an extra boost!<br /><br />Another great use is to apply it to your scalp and hair to help with dry, brittle hair and itchy scalps. Some people even add it directly to their current shampoo to make it easier to apply. But that’s up to you of course.<br /><br />As with all oils and sensitive skin types, make sure to try a small spot first. If you notice irritation, consider adding it to coconut or olive oil then applying it to your skin.<br /><br />Put this miracle oil to work for you.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.	2015-08-01

I was provided one of these Venus & Olay razors to test out via a program run by Venus. The five blade razor shaved the same width as my regular razor, however the blades seemed spaced closer together. The razor rinsed out easily, that along with no need for shaving cream makes for a quick shave for this razor. My favorite application of it is to shave my armpits in the sink when there is just no time to hop in the shower. It's also wonderful for shaving legs what ever the senario. I never had a problem with razor rash using this, which is typically a bit off an issue for me. The shave gel bars were a bit bulky at first, so the first few times I ever used it, I did have trouble with my bikini line, just getting the razor where I needed it was a little awkward so I ended up going back per the same areas with old razor. Still no shaving cream was needed then! The built in shave gel bars come off thick when the razor is fresh. I also noticed that I did not get as close of a shave as I am accostomed to using what I consider regular pressure, because of the way they razor slid atop the thick layer of shave gel. After using it a few different times that was no longer an issue. I had to get used to a different feel of the razor in my hand, change my technique a little, and the shave gel did not come off quite as think after the first few uses. After many uses the shave gel bars are almost gone. Now that they are thin and don't touch as great an are of my skin I think I will continue to use the razor for a bit as a normal razor with my regular shaving cream as the blades are still sharp and not yet needing to he replaced. Other people might not run in to this senario, I feel tht I rinsed off a lot of the gel bars just rinsing my hair out of the razor, however I have very thick hair. Overall this has given me the best shave experience, no razor burn, no need for additional shaving cream, less overall time spent shaving with this! The vanilla creme scent was hardly noticeableto me, so I can definitely say it was not over powering or unpleasant.	2015-08-01

Beauty	5	145	147	N	N	Great option as a more natural cleanser!	Edited to add: I've had this bottle for almost 5 months and its still not empty. Granted I only use it 2-3 times a week at most, but it takes the *tiniest* bit to work and I still love it. Very happy to have this!  This is by far my favorite cleanser that I've tried in a long time. I have been slowly making the switch to more natural options in terms of my skincare and my household and this was offered at a promotional rate, so I had to try it. I like it so much more than I expected! I stopped using cleansers on my face about a year ago and my face completely cleared up once I did, so I'm always hesitant to throw things off. BUT somedays you just need to get that *clean* feeling that only soaps provide. After a busy day outside with the kids (I live in Florida), or a really good workout, or after you've been sick for a couple days and just have that icky feeling. Water alone is a good cleaner for most days, but this has definitely become my &#34;I want to get my face REALLY clean&#34; cleanser. It cleans well without completely stripping my face of everything and doesn't leave my face a dry wasteland like &#34;regular&#34; cleansers do. It smells good, it lathers just enough but not a crazy amount, and it only takes a teensy tiny bit to work. About half the size of a pea and you are good to do your whole face and neck. An excellent value, especially in regards to exposing yourself to less chemicals and nasty stuff! I received this product at a reduced cost and/or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-01

I noticed this lightening my face in a matter of 2 weeks. I am a dark chocolate girl, from the Caribbean. This is a smaller bottle than expected but it goes a long ways. I have been using mine for over a month and there is a quarter left. I am using it every day twice a day, on my face and neck. I am noticing it badly lighten my neck, but my far is definitely more than 3 shades lighter than it was before using this. When I use to wear mascara, I could not notice my lashes because my skin was so dark, but now I can tell that I have gotten so much lighter because my mascara pops. This definitely works, at least on dark chocolates like myself.  I bought the skin lotion along with this and got all excited it would do the same to my skin… it didn't do s***. SO I might just buy this and use it on my legs and arms too	2015-08-01

I love the &#34;simple&#34; brand, because their products don't contain a bunch of harsh ingredients. So naturally, I bought these wipes because of my past experiences with their other products. These wipes defnitely do the job of removing my mascara, foundation, and lipstick. Another plus is that there is no perfume, so the wipes are as &#34;simple&#34; as it can get. Sadly, the material of the wipe itself is too rough. I didn't realize the packaging said it was an exfoliating wipe, so I expected a more gentle texture. The roughness irritated my skin, so now I use this only in emergencies. If your skin is more tolerant to such harsh exfoliation, then you should have no problem with this product.	2015-08-01

Product arrived quickly. Came with a pump and a flip top, which if very convenient for use. It also lists the manufacturing date and expiration date (3 years, which is a surprise. I didn't think the shelf life was that long for Sweet Almond Oil.) This is also a good price for such a large bottle.<br /><br />Sweet Almond Oil is a great oil. It's &#34;light&#34; and literally has no scent. It's supposed to sooth dry skin and irritated areas. I have sensitive, allergic, reactive, rosacea skin. Have to be really careful what I use on it. Only use carrier oils to moisturize. The last week, or so, I've been having a lot of bumpy, rashy skin--especially on my cheeks. I thought I might be having an allergic reaction to some serums I'd made. (One drop of an essential oil blend in a teaspoon of carrier oil--a 1% dilution, which is appropriate for face.) I actually figured out that it's not the essential oil blends, it's another allergy season starting (I get this way with tree and grass pollen in the spring and ragweed in the fall.) I've used the Pure Acres Farm Sweet Almond Oil and so far, no problem. My skin stayed smooth and pink (good for me.) It also absorbed quickly--a plus for summer time.<br /><br />Another way that I use carrier oils is to protect my skin in the winter. Before I go out in the elements, I always put a few drops of oil on my face. It also helps protect your skin from the dryness in the house when the heat is on. I use those few drops on my face several times a day--when I wake up, after my shower and any other time I think of it, or my face feels dry.<br /><br />Another thing that I want to do is make a herb oil infusion and make my own lip balm. For a lot of people, Sweet Almond Oil is the oil of choice for lip balm. I've just started to make herb infused oils (which are easy.) I've made salves for first aid and pain, so far. Next attempt will be lip balm. It's just some infused oil, beeswax and essential oils to flavor (which is optional.) If it's ofinterest, you can do a web search and come up with a lot of easy recipes.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review.	2015-08-01

My hair looks and smells so good!	Absolutely the best hair serum that I have ever used and I have used several products. I love the scent as well; it is so refreshing and the scent stays with your hair for a while. I love smelling my hair.  This serum has 12-Exotic Oils and as soon as your put it in your hand you feel the silkiness right away. You do not have to use much and I have long thick hair and just used about the size of a nickel in the palm of my hand and rubbed my hands together and ran my hands through my hair. I then used a little tiny bit more and used that on the ends of my hair.  I have wavy hair and I used my straightener and my hair looked so good.  No frizzy strands and my hair is silky and shiny. I received this product at a discounted price during a promotional period for testing in exchange for an honest review.  This product is salon quality and this price is less than what you would pay at a salon for this quality product. This is my opinion and coming from a person that tries hair products out all of the time and this is an amazing serum that will last a long time because it only takes a little to have your hair looking fabulous.  This girl is excited!	2015-08-01

Actually, day two you already start to see a change in your skin. I have what most will call a farmers tan. I have a good tan on my lower arms and legs and my face, but thats it! Just after 3 days my pale areas match my tan areas, pretty impressive! I used this years ago but did not commit myself to put it on everyday. NOW. . .I am more dedicated to this product--which I may add--after a week of putting this lotion on (just 7 times). . .the tan will stay on 7-14 days straight! So it is a love/hate relationship, but you will gain the tan quicker than you lose it. It looks SO NATURAL too! It matched my skin very well, just about identical. My friends (on day 2) said I looked more tan even though the areas where I put the lotion on were not visible, they could slightly see my upper arms and wow that was a confidence booster! If there are areas of your skin that you would like to &#34;dismiss&#34; for lack of better words, this is the stuff to help cover that up with a darker shade. Great stuff, lasts a very long time! And yes it has an expiration date, says to use within a year. So this is a 365 day cure, sounds good enough to me! I will be a dedicated buyer of this natural glow moisturizer. By the way, smells like lotion. . .almost baby-like lotion, is not bad whatsoever! Tan up, look great and feel confident!	2015-08-01

It is a good product but my sister and I find that we need to re-apply every other week. Could be the climate--but we gave up after a few times. My sister had a hard time applying it/perfecting her eyebrows. I ended up getting stiff makeup brushes to apply the dye--this made application much easier for her. Color is dark the first day or two them starts to fade. I don't think it works very well or lasts for folks with sparse eyebrow hair. I think think this product may be better suited for those who have hair--but need/want to darken them. For now I will stick with my powder/wax combo. My sister uses it every once in a while just to fill in the bald spots when she has events coming up.	2015-08-01

I had recently bought a product at Walmart for this purpose.  It  was a liquid and was miserable to use.  I saw this product for sale on Amazon and decided to try it.  What a difference!!  I have had hair loss after each of the surgeries I have had. My doctor says this happens to some people and I am one of the &#34;lucky&#34; ones!  This product goes on so well and cases me no aggravation.

I have purchased many different eye masks over the years and so I figured what would it hurt to try one more to see what made it different from all the others.  What I like most about this eye mask is that the head strap is adjustable. It gives you the freedom of wearing it tight or loose, whatever makes you comfortable. When the mask is used along with the included ear plugs you can get a quiet yet dark nights sleep. The mask has a soft velvet like feel which I really love.	2015-08-01

I'm giving the Murad Balancing Moisturizer 3 stars.<br />The Pros: it does not irritate my skin. It goes on lightweight. It absorbs quickly. It also appears to be making my pores smaller or appear smaller in my T-zone, after applying once a day for a few days.<br />The Cons: The ingredients to achieve this.  In doing research on women's hormones and looking at this product's contents, several ingredients are endocrine blockers.  I won't go into details about endocrine disrupting ingredients because there's plenty of information out there if you're interested.  I'm mentioning it here because had I done more research before purchasing, I'd have moved on and looked for a more hormone-friendly product.<br />As always, it comes down to personal choice/preference.  For me, I've found that I want something that will be harmonious with my body more than I want the beauty bonuses it promises.	2015-08-01

We all have coarse, thick, curly hair (well, what's left of it, in my case). We decided to give this a try to see if its claims of making hair-care easier for people like us panned out.<br /><br />For my wife and for me, the product works as advertised. You apply it to your hair while dry, just before wetting your hair for shampooing. It conditions the hair well (it's basically a conditioner that you use first, instead of last), and makes it much easier to get a comb through the hair, without leaving hair greasy.<br /><br />One setback is that the product makes it pretty clear that it can irritate the eyes, and should be kept away from children. So my wife vetoed the original plan to try it on our four year-old, who whines (and sometimes screams) her way through any attempt to comb her hair. We'll give it a try on her in the future, but for the grownups in our house, it works as advertised.	2015-08-01

I have bleach damaged, coarse curly hair and bought this straightener to help eliminate the extra frizz and flyaways I was experiencing due to some hair breakage.

The vapor makes such a difference and I feel like my hair is growing healthier and stronger now. The only reason I did not give it five stars is I feel like not enough vapor is coming out of mine - I have watched videos on YouTube and on the product's page on Hot Tools and it seems like everyone else is getting a lot more vapor.

I'm sad it's no longer available -- I think it's because there was a mistake in price, as it was about half that of the others. I got this cream for a skin condition and it works great. It helps soothe and heal a persistent rash on my arm that I initially got after a sunburn. I also use it as a moisturizer on my face and neck. Non-greasy, absorbs well, good ingredients. I read that a D3 deficiency is prevalent in most people, and that it is best taken trans-dermally because that is how your body synthesizes it naturally. With this item no longer being available, I've tried the other D3 creams available on Amazon - they have the same ingredients and work just as well.	2015-08-01

Don't expect it to remove your heavy makeup. I remove my makeup prior to cleansing , always, even if I'm not wearing a lot and I recommend that you do so with this cleanser. Overall I really like it , the price is the thing that kinda sets me of haha, nut I'm kinda cheap especially when it comes to cleansers, bc I think,&#34;you just cleanse fast and wash off&#34; but I'll hopefully keep buying it in the near future :)	2015-08-01

Turned dry, itchy, burning, red rash, peeling, alligator skin on my face and around my puffy eyes into soft moisturized silky skin.

Frown lines around my eyes are less deep.<br />I bought Hyaluronic Acid out of desperation. I used so many over the counter creams and lotion, I could not name them all.  I also used prescription lotion and creams from my dermatologist. Not of that stuff worked. Most of the products I used burned my skin.<br /><br />The price is right. I would buy this product again and recommend it to anyone with symptoms similar  to mine.  I stopped  using it for a few days to see if it really  made a difference.

And mixing into homemade beauty products. The price for this is justified, it's unrefined, cold pressed and I need to gush over the dark glass bottle with the dropper top. I end up with an oily bottle that leaves rings on anything it touches with the brands I have been using. I'm torn between hoarding and doling this out to myself over months drop by drop or using it for everything and buying another so i can use the bottle for all the things!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this product so i could try it and give my honest opinion.	2015-08-01

In the photos I've posted I used the product from lid to brow bone. I makes the whites whiter, and the colors brighter.<br /><br />The jumbo pencil glides on smoothly when you apply and is quite creamy. Once you smooth it a bit with your finger you're ready to go. Pat  your eyeshadow on top to set the cream and once you've done an initial layer of shadow you can begin blending out the colors or lack thereof as needed.<br /><br />The pencil sharpens easily as the shell is made of plastic. All you need is a jumbo pencil sharpener. If you prefer it in a pot all you have to do is microwave or use a blow dryer to melt the product down into whatever container you'd like. (Use caution)<br /><br />I have bought this product multiple times and will continue to do so in the future.	2015-08-01

This serum made a difference to my facial skin.  I noticed my skin was shinier, not greasy.  The serum is like a very light cream, it goes on very smooth.  Becareful with how much comes out, as a lot tends to come out.  I also travel with it, and notice that it's quite thick, and sometimes the cream is around the tube, not under it, so I can't pump anything out... easy fix though.  I can just unscrew it and move it around a little.  Believe me, I will waste nothing.  It doesn't seem to really help my eye area though, but that's not what I bought it for.  It also has a delicious citrus smell.  It seems to absorb fairly well, not a long time before I put on my moisturizer.  I bought two bottles.  This will be my serum for a long time.  I'll put it this way, I've been looking for a new eye cream, but have not been researching anymore vitamin C facial serums.  I use it after my morning shower, and at night after I cleanse my face.	2015-08-01

These type of pins are no good, because they took a short cut in manufacturring. Bobby pins always had waves on top part of the pins so the pins won't slip out. It is not a decoration. Those waves were put in the design for a reason. Modern manufacture, with the intent of cutting cost must have<br />eliminated the waves. Sounds like man's idea. They have no idea why those waves are put in because they never use them. I have been looking for<br />long pins with waves for my cignon and couls not find them at the store, until I found them on line from out of USA.	2015-08-01

Beauty	4	1	1	N	N	I think this has worked well for me, and I like the ingredients	I've been using this in the morning for a couple of weeks now.  It has been gentle, moisturizing, and non-irritating to my sometimes sensitive skin.  I don't notice much of a scent to it and it has not caused me to break out.  It absorbs quickly and does not interfere with the subsequent application of makeup (I use it after toner and before moisturizer).<br /><br />It is hard to tell if I am seeing a benefit from this, but I actually think that's the point.  This contains a lot of antioxidants (including, for example, vitamins A, C, and E and green tea extract), which are supposed to protect against sun damage.  (They do not take the place of a good sunscreen, and I have been wearing an SPF 50 sunscreen under my makeup as well.)  If you do not see an increase in fine lines and/or discoloration, then this product may very well be doing its job.<br /><br />I like all the plant extracts in the ingredients, and I love that this doesn't contain any artificial dyes or fragrances (you can see the ingredients list if you scroll down the product page).  This contains dimethicone (a silicone), which I know some people avoid.  But overall, I like the ingredients profile and think this is a good addition to my summer skincare regimen.	2015-08-01

This brush has major manufacturer's defects.  I paid the $12.95 price.  Thought the Escali would be at least as good as the one at Walgreen's.  But I was wrong.  The Walgreen's brush has lasted for years.  And I don't remember when the last time was I saw a loose bristle.  With the Escali brush, on average I lose 30 to 40 bristles during each daily shave.  They stick all over the razor, on my face, in the lather, and all over the sink bowl.  It's disgusting.  The loose bristles interfere with the shaving process and are difficult to remove from the razor.  Doesn't matter if you use hot or cold water.  Same thing happens.  A month later still dropping bristles like crazy.  Do not buy this brush, you will be sorry if you do.  Will write the seller and request a refund or credit, not sure how that's going to work out.	2015-08-01

I received three shades: Rosy, Bronzed, and Luminous. While they could all be used as blushes on different skin tone, it was basically a contouring set for me: blush (Rosy), light gold bronzer (Bronzed) and highlighter (Luminous). They all have a wonderful, smooth consistency. The powder goes on flawlessly, and has the staying power of a cream blush. It doesn't cause any issues with my very sensitive skin, and the coloring lasts all day. However, the three shades I have run a little pale (even Bronzed is more medium sunbaked gold than anything else) so if you have a darker complexion or a good tan, these may not make much of a difference. Overall, though, these are high quality blushes, and for that they get five stars.	2015-08-01

It physically made my teeth hurt. Like when youre young, you eat a bunch of candy and your teeth hurt the next day any time you try to eat something crunchy or chewy.

Phoenix is his favorite scent in the AXE line and, as his mother, I don't find it offensive like some of the horrific things his teen friends wear.  This scent would, in my opinion, smell great on a grown man as well.  It doesn't scream &#34;I'm a teenager&#34; like some scents do.<br />As for the products, he has worn the AXE solid antiperspirant for years and it has always kept him dry and smelling great.  The body wash works well, and the scent does linger a bit, but it does contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) for those who are looking to avoid it.  Finally, the spray... ohhhhhh the spray... it seems to be a *must* for any young teenager.  It is strong but in our house the rule is, it must be sprayed outside the house, away from the body, and then walked into.  This isn't for some great health reason, it is for my poor nose when it is stuck in a small vehicle with him I don't want gag on a fragrance bomb.  One of my favorite things about the spray is how it locks so it can't accidentally go off in a drawer and coat the inside and everything else inside the drawer.  This has happened on more than one occasion with a different spray.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great set.  It is labeled as a &#34;gift box&#34; but it is really just these three items in the cardboard box pictured above.  There is nothing special to make it a gift box (like a tin, fun inserts, etc.) but it is currently much cheaper to buy these in this set rather than individually.	2015-08-01

This little bottle should last a long time even with daily use!	If you're new to essential oils, a good Lavender essential oil should be one of your first purchases.<br /><br />Lavender oil can be used for:<br />Muscle aches and stress<br />Sun burns/other burns<br />Acne treatment<br />Wound healing<br />Foot bath<br />and most importantly, it can be used in a diffuser to help with calming and sleep and I gotta say, it really works for putting me to sleep. I've always had trouble falling asleep but with the scent of Lavender in the air I am out like a light.<br /><br />Now I gotta be honest, there are much bigger bottles out there for around the same price as this oil and while there are many awesome ones (Check out Majestic Pure for some awesome oils) this is by far one of the strongest lavenders I have ever run across. With that in mind, I have no doubt that this bottle will last every bit as long as a 4oz bottle simply because you don't have to use nearly as much.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to get a discount because they are currently changing their packaging/labeling and had to deplete their old stock, but this isn't my first time buying from Plant Therapy and their oils are consistently great!. I love this stuff and at full price its still a killer deal!	2015-08-01

Not sure if this was an oversight, but it really kills the mood of the product, at least for me anyway.<br /><br />I was expecting a cream that smelled like tea tree oil, which I love, but I couldn't detect the fragrance at all. I got this product to use on my cyclical cystic acne, which I get on my chin. I will say, in the time I've been using it, I have seen a little bit of lessening of acne bumps, but nothing major. I will continue to use this, and see if it makes a big difference say after 2 months or so.	2015-08-01

Lush bombs dissolve pretty quick, but these take a while & are super-concentrated. I just let it dissolve to the size a little bigger than a golf ball, then I take it out and save it for my next bath. It doesn't give you pretty water, which kinda sucks. It's just a cloudy, light-lavender color. Not as fun as Lush, but definitely makes my skin feel good & relaxes me too. If you're used to Lush, don't expect a unique scent (it smells exactly like its name, it isn't a combination like Lush) or pretty water. And don't use the whole thing like you do with Lush products, these are very strong.	2015-08-01

Acne Fighting Foundation Ivory, 1.21 Fluid Ounce	Beauty	5	0	1	N	Y	My undertones are definitely pink but I'm not pale and freckled like most redheads	I have auburn hair and fair coloring. My undertones are definitely pink but I'm not pale and freckled like most redheads. This was a little yellow for my skin. But it blends in just fine so no biggie.  And now that it's the peak of summer it's a little light, but I'm sure it'll be a great shade once fall rolls around.  I recently got a sudden adult acne breakout which I've never had before. So in attempt to narrow down what caused it it I threw out all of my makeup brushes and my facial makeup. But after about two weeks of going makeup free I couldn't stand it anymore. My face was only getting worse and seeing just my reflection in windows was enough to make me want to cry. Which is how I ended up buying this. It isn't a very heavy cover up, but it does just fine. You can still see my blemishes (I'm not sure there's a makeup in the world that could hide those), but it hides all the red blotchiness. While it isn't healing my acne, it also isn't aggravating it either. Which is all I could ask for from such a cheap foundation. I use a beauty sponge to apply it all over my face and then I use the residual foundation in the cap as concealer and apply it with a concealer makeup brush. I wash all of my makeup application tools AT LEAST once a week. I've started using an acne treatment with benzoyl peroxide which makes my face CRAZY flaky and dry, even combined with a high quality moisturizer. And if I have a particularly flaky day with this on my face it can look pretty gross. Since my skin appears to be normal color it just looks like I'm shedding like a lizard. So if you're using a treatment that causes your skin to flake sometimes just be careful putting this makeup over it because it can look kinda gross. If you can stand it going makeup free might be better. But if I'm having a good non-flaky day this is just fine and disguises the wreck my face has become.<br /><br />UPDATE: After using this for a long time it's my favorite foundation. I went to a dermatologist and got my acne under control. It was a rough road but it's gone now. So with acne free skin this is fabulous for me. It looks so natural on my face. I can apply it with clean fingers, or a beauty sponge, or a foundation brush. All applications look very natural. If I want a more makeup-y look I sometimes use a powder over it. Otherwise I just leave it be and use concealer to touch up trouble spots. Looks like my skin is just naturally smooth. Love it.under control. It was a rough road but it's gone now.

While they are really cute in terms of style- be forewarned, they are really poor quality. Now, I know, I know. They're cheap in terms of price.

Don't get me wrong, they're super cute, and I will wear them until they fall apart (which will be pretty quickly from what I gather).

My two year old absolutely hates to have her hair brushed. She will actually hide any hair brush she can get her hands on. If she sees me coming with a brush in hand, she will run and hide. With the Knot Genie I can hide the brush in my palm and brush her hair before she has a chance to run away. Brushing is so much faster with the Knot Genie!! What took 1-2 minutes to brush, I can now complete in seconds. One stroke brushes the top, middle and bottom of hair. My daughter actually doesn't mind having her hair brushed with the Knot Genie!!! If I use another type of brush she screams and hides.<br /><br />As to the purchase of this item, everything went very smooth. The item arrived earlier than expected. The Knot Genie was exactly what is shown in the image and works as said.<br /><br />As a mother of two girls, I know how painful the hair brushing experience can be, for the child and the mother.

Beauty	5	0	0	N	Y	I like the fine bristles on these brushes	I like the fine bristles on these brushes. I always have used tooth brushes with smaller heads so the size didn't bug me. I like how soft they are. I have very sensitive teeth so I've been told repeatedly to be gentle when I brush. Which I am, but it helps when you have a toothbrush that's gentle also. I forgot to reorder these once and had to use a toothbrush I bought at the store for a few days and my teeth felt dirty pretty quickly. But as soon as I got these in the mail my teeth felt better as soon as I used it! I use charcoal sometimes to brush my teeth and it does help them get whiter. I'm not sure if the charcoal on these brushes helps or not. I can't really tell a difference. But if it helps keep them more germ free then awesome! I just don't know if it actually does or not. But the shape and size of the brush are wonderful!	2015-08-01

I get comments on how nice my hair smells after putting this in and friends that have used it went on to buy it as well so I think that speaks for itself.  I like that this oil is not heavy, I have long straight hair and I pump two pumps and rub it around in my hands before applying.  I apply this to the ends of my hair and then use the excess on my hands and run it through the body of my hair.  As long as you don't use too much it will not look greasy or clump your hair.

So far so good. I'm a professional makeup artist who values proper sanitation and cruelty free products. I have several brush sets so I have access to clean brushes for each client. I was looking for a few extra synthetic kabuki brushes for buffing in foundation and a few soft fluffy blending brushes for eyes. For the price of this set, I figured if I got 4 good brushes out of it-hooray! Ends up, several are quite functional and all are soft.  Time will tell how well they hold up to frequent washing. I pulled out this set expecting to use only a few and found I could do a whole face with these brushes with out going back to my much more expensive brushes. Very cool. The face powder brushes could be more dense in my opinion. I squeezed them down to get the effect I needed. May only use for light dusting of setting powder in future. Synthetic taklon brush hairs are very soft with fairly good pick up. Handles feel like light weight cheaper bamboo and metal but look nice. Very good value. Will update after a few washes.	2015-08-01

I am totally shocked that anyone like this, let alone so may great reviews!! I really don't get it. Is my product defective? Is this really how it's supposed to work?  And people like it??? smh<br />The guard that allow you to adjust the height of the trim is super flimsy. I used the &#34;4&#34; setting, but when I went to shave, it was actually the pressure applied to my face that determined how close it got.  I ruined by beard.  I now have patches and spots where it trimmed closer than the setting.  The the piece that adjust is only anchored on one end, which is why it flexes so much. I'm returning mine immediately and I am thankful that my beard grows fast and that it is a friday, because I couldn't go back to work like this.	2015-08-01

I have never had any root touch-up product before.  I love it!  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  The product is a powder. I ordered the dark brown (my natural hair color is brown).  You tap it a few times lightly angled downward and the powder gets on the brush.  You then simply wipe the brush against your grey roots and magically, the grey disappears.  I put it on this morning and no more grey at my temples.  I worked a long day today (12 hours) and I still see no grey at the end of the day, so it didn't come off.  This will help cover up that grey between my hair appointments.  I hate to be so vain, but I just hate to see grey hairs....so this will help my vanity issue.

I like the effects of the mask better than the experience of putting it on and using it.<br /><br />  My first impression was that the jar was rather small, but it really only takes a tiny bit. There are several applications in the jar.  It smells medicinal.  I don't care for the smell but it's tolerable.<br /><br />Even though it is clay, it is very moisturizing and leaves skin feeling very soft, and not at all tight.  It does seem to brighten skin some, and it leaves my pores nice and tight and looking small.  I do like that.<br /><br />Directions are to put a thick layer on, and to leave it for 15-30 minutes.  It states it might tingle some, because of the glycolic acid, but I did not experience that.  You can rub it in small circles as it dries to exfoliate a bit.  I didn't find it all that exfoliating though.<br /><br />It does rinse off quite easily with just warm water.	2015-08-01

Elrique Naturals Peppermini Essential Oil BIG 2 OZ SIZE 100% Gold-Standard!	Beauty	4	1	1	N	N	Practical and smells great!	I picked up this peppermint essential oil for a few reasons. When I get a headache I try to get rid of it naturally by drinking peppermint tea. While I love peppermint tea, sometimes it’s just too hot to enjoy a cup. I haven’t tried using this oil as a remedy yet, but so far I love the smell and think it’s really going to help.  I read that peppermint oil gets rid of ants which we have a small problem with near our windows. I don’t like using chemical ant sprays, but I resort to it because I can’t stand ants. This bottle of peppermint essential oil comes with a spray spout that made spraying this by the windows a breeze. It seems to be helping since I’ve only seen a couple of ants around.  I love the smell of peppermint and find it really refreshing. Since the bottle doesn’t have a dropper I unscrew the spray cap and use the end of it to place a few drops in some sweet almond oil. Make sure to mix the peppermint oil with a carrier oil (like the sweet almond oil) before putting it on your skin.  The oil came packaged well and I haven’t had any problems with it leaking. I would prefer it come in a glass bottle, but at least the plastic bottle is darkened which helps essential oils keep longer. This peppermint oil smells wonderful and the price is great for 2 oz. I can’t wait to try the other essential oils Elrique Naturals carries since I’ve been happy with this one.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are entirely my own and not influenced in any way.	2015-08-01

The mask has a sticky gel-jelly like consistency and is very cooling on the face when I first applied it. I apply it with a brush and I have to say that it is very messy both when you apply it and also when you take it off. When this dries and if you don't apply the product evenly, instead of taking it off as a whole face mask, you will have to take time removing patch by patch of this face mask that's on your face. When I came back to this product after a few months not using it, this stung my face really badly. I removed this when it wasn't dried yet because it was stinging my face; probably because of the alcohol, and it was a pain to remove. This is only good for people who have a lot of patience but NOT me. There are plenty of inexpensive face masks in the drugstore that I like way better than this.	2015-08-01

I didn't buy this lotion on Amazon, but I did purchase it  at my local drug store. Being a faithful neutrogena customer, I thought I would give it a try because I used to use a different moisturizer (for combination skin) that had a pleasant odor and felt light on my face while also feeling like it is hydrating my skin. I figured I would feel this way about this as it is a similar product, but with a higher spf and features the word &#34;healthy&#34; which catches my attention.<br />First, the pump on the bottle barely pushes any out. I use a generous amount usually but this was a dismal pump at best. The lotion had a very strong scent which was off putting for me. I decided to apply it anyhow, as I am not one who is typically sensitive to strong scents. The absolute worst part of this product which made me demote from 2 to 1 stars is IT STINGS! My face felt like it was scraped across pavement. Keep in mind, I have a high tolerance to this type of thing. No known allergic reactions to any fragrances or anything else. It only lasts about 2 minutes, but it is a very unpleasant 2 minutes. I tried to rub it off immediately after but the stinging sensation was already in full swing.<br /><br />I have only used it twice at this point. I used it immediately after purchase, and then after I got home and removed my makeup and washed my face, I applied it a second time. Both times I had the same results. I sit here typing this only about 15 minutes after applying and the tingling is still persisting ever so slightly in my cheeks. I will admit, however, that my skin feels slightly more hydrated, but it is borderline sticky.<br /><br />Overall, I DO NOT recommend. If you like Neutrogena then I strongly suggest going with the other moisturizers that they have.<br /><br />PS the bottle suggests reapplying every 2 hours.........Even if this didn't have the side effects, I don't really want a moisturizer that needs that frequent of a reapplication.<br /><br />LOVE YOUR SKIN! STAY AWAY!!	2015-08-01

It is really good at making all fungal infections visible so you can treat them as for treating them it didn't work for me. At all really. it doesn't burn and tends to soothe however is just really for showing the infection. After using it for 2 weeks i followed with 3x daily treatments of De-colorized Iodine (you can fine any pharmacy) which has done more to heal this inflection in 10 days than any of the other products have. SO yes this is great for finding infected areas but in my case it just made the infected areas larger.	2015-08-01

I remember being happy when I tried coconut oils and other oils for my skin, but they were all too greasy and heavy. Coconut oil would leave me so greasy. I was looking to a natural alternative to moisturizer without all the chemicals so I am very happy I found this.<br /><br />I also use it for my cuticles/nails, as makeup remover, night eye cream, hair serum and an overnight hair treatment and it works wonderfully for all of those things. I even mix a drop with my concealer or foundation and it makes it so glowy and pretty. Anyway this is my holy grail I'm so glad I found it.

I'm at that stage of life where I am thinking about breakouts and anti-aging so it is nice to have a product that combines both types of benefits (usually you get one or the other, but not both).<br /><br />This is a foaming cleanser and must be used with the pump.  Like all foaming cleansers, it is rather thin and relies on the pump to create volume (through injection of air bubbles).  The texture is really too thin for my taste, but I still think the product is effective.<br /><br />I generally use this twice a day -- in the morning and then to remove makeup in the evening.  It gets most, but not all, of my liquid foundation.  In this, it is pretty typical of other cleansers I have used.  I will say, though, that I have been rather stressed lately (moved to a new house plus my dog has been sick) and yet my skin is clearer than it has been for a long while.  So this is definitely helping.  (I suspect the salicylic acid and tea tree oil are largely responsible.)<br /><br />Here is the full ingredients list:<br /><br />ACTIVE INGREDIENT: SALICYLIC ACID 1%<br /><br />INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Water, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Propanediol, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Camphor, Menthol, Turmeric Root Extract, Globularia Alypum Leaf Extract, Broccoli Extract, Willow Bark Extract, Red Tea Leaf Extract, Green And White Tea Leaf Extract, Goji Berry Fruit Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Grape Seed Extract, Algae Extract, Allantoin, Panthenol, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Anisate, Sodium Phytate, Alginate, Arnica Montana Extract, Sunflower Seed Oil, Matricaria Flower Extract, Fragrance, Citral, Eugenol, Linalool, Limonene.<br /><br />I love that it contains no artificial dyes.  It does contain a fragrance ingredient (no idea if it's natural or not; truthfully, I don't notice the scent much because I am hard-pressed to describe it, even after using 3/4 of the bottle).  I love all the antioxidants (from pomegranate, goji berries, green tea, etc.), which should (in combination with a good SPF product) help fight free radical damage.  This contains hyaluronic acid and so is likely not a vegan product (most hyaluronic acid used in industry is generated as a byproduct of poultry processing, although there are some plant-based alternatives).<br /><br />This rinses off cleanly and has not irritated my skin.  It's more difficult to describe the anti-aging effects since I am mostly using this as prevention rather than treatment, except to say that the antioxidants and hyaluronic acid (a polymer that hangs on to moisture and thus helps with fine lines) are found in a lot of anti-aging preparations.<br /><br />Overall, though, I'm quite happy with this product.ea, etc.), which should (in combination with a good SPF product) help fight free radical damage.

The buffer works as advertised, and by using the 4 sides in the correct sequence of grit, I was able to get rid of the ridges and eventually get the nail plate shiny. The product I received does NOT have the sides labelled as the product photo shows, I had to discover by trial and error which order to use the four sides in. There were no instructions, either. The packaging looked like it is intended for professional nail salon techs to use at work; they would know without needing to read labels which sides are which in order of grit.<br />The quality seems to be not very good, in that I was only able to get three or four uses before the grit on the #1 and #2 sides was pretty much worn off. But maybe that's normal? I would assume that a nail salon would only use this buffing block on one client, then discard it, right? So maybe it would be actually wasteful to make them more durable. Maybe they're meant to be as disposable as a a cotton swab.	2015-08-01

It just was a bad experience which is a shame because I trained my hair for washing once a week due to it's length.  I actually got back in the shower and re washed with the biolage I had.

Female comfort really helped with my ovarian cyst. I use to take it years ago when it was called FC w/ Dong Quai for my menstural cycle.

It has two speeds and three heat settings, plus the &#34;cold shot&#34; for setting curls. The round brush is okay - it's plastic, and I prefer brushes with a metal backing to help with setting curls. I was expecting standard size sectioning clips, but these are extra large and hold tightly - wonderful for my daughter's long, thick hair.  The motor puts out a lot of air but isn't particularly loud. I'm very happy with this kit.	2015-08-01

However, the connection between the trimmer base and the various heads will wear out quickly.  Once the connection starts to wear out, the heads will shake violently becoming loud, uncomfortable, and ineffective.  If you use this on a near daily basis, expect it to happen within a year.  I have gone through two of these trimmers over the last few years and had the same issue with both.  I was hoping the first trimmer was a fluke and I even took better care of the second trimmer but it still wore out quickly.  I am still looking for the right trimmer for daily use - I'd be glad to pay more if it would last me a number of years.	2015-08-01

I already have horrendous stretch marks from baby #1.  They're old and faded now, but I'm hoping to prevent more with baby #2.  So while I can't speak on how well this stuff fades stretch marks, or prevents them (yet), I can say that after only a few weeks of using it my skin is definitely smoother!  There used to be craters from the old stretch marks and there aren't anymore!  That itself is a miracle.  I wish I had this stuff 7 years ago and maybe I wouldn't have gotten any stretch marks at all.  I had tried to prevent them with bio oil and the palmers cocoa butter stuff.  Didn't work.  I'm certain that if there was a cream that would prevent them it would be this one.	2015-08-01

I couldn't be happier with it. I clean once or twice a day. I just get my fingers wet, rub the top of the bar and lather it onto my face and rinse, and that's it! I'm still looking for something else to make my skin look bright and fresh as I have noticed it looks dull without makeup, but at least this took care of my pimples! I highly recommend.

I would definitely recommend this mirror. I travel quite a lot and think it could be a bit bulky but it is so handy to use that I may just take it in my carryon.	2015-08-01

I like that you may cut the long product into any size and shape you need. I have washed the same two pieces for two months, with hand soap, sanitizing them with each a spray of vinegar and then, peroxide. They have maintained the same shape and consistency. The outer fabric had developed a few pills, but were easily pulled. The two long easy-to-cut cushions/tubes, that came in the order, will last, I am guessing, a year, unless more toes begin to pain. This purchase will be cheaper than buying the one day use of Dr. Scholl's or Equate corn cushions, every 9+ days.	2015-08-01

I was supplied this deodorant for free from Bzzagent via Secret. I was skeptical to try Secret since it had been years since I had last used it. My underarms tend to be sensitive and so I usually drift towards natural and non-scented varieties. This July has been a scorcher and my Tom's natural deodorant wasn't holding up as well. I was excited to try this and once it came in I put it right on.<br />Pros -<br />- It didn't irritate my skin at all.<br />- My application lasted 48 hours easily through July heat.<br />- It was easy to glide on and dried extremely quick. Didn't leave any icky feeling.<br />- It didn't mark my clothes!<br />Con -<br />- The scent was very strong and a touch off-putting. BUT - it did fade over the day.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend.	2015-08-01

This device has a couple small flaws, but once you get used to them you seem to be able to deal with them okay.  Firstly, both the battery compartment lid and the little lint storage compartment keep sliding off the body of the shaver.  The snap locking tabs are inadequate and could use some beefing up.  And secondly, if you hold the shaver face down, the lint will build up in the cutting area and may ball up inside.  I had to clear this area with a bent paper clip a couple of times.  Other than these somewhat annoying problems, the device works well and is probably worth its small cost.	2015-08-01

Since she is so selective, I bought a used one for trial after cleaning it with Lysol and rubbing alchohol; it's absolutely worth the money but $230 is a bit steep.  It is very well made in USA with a 10-foot cord, unlike most of the imported cheap stuff, such as Homedic variety.<br /><br />She has severe diabetes and leg swelling.  After just 20 minutes in high (II) mode, she detected scratchy/itchy feelings in her feet.  I advised her to do it 3x/day (she can go extreme) for starter.  Her swelling has gone down on her first day.<br /><br />She also liked it when I shifted it on a slant mode so she could do her lower calves.  Its a keeper.<br /><br />Suggestion for improvement: one of the competitors has variable speed, not just 2-speed.  A built-in timer would be nice.  It's noisy and does vibrate (the correct term is oscillation), so put it on top of a rug or towel but not a tile or hardwood floor.<br /><br />Similar products made by the same manufacturer are: Jeanie Rub, Maxi Rub and Medi Massager.	2015-08-01

I wear a light dusting of it over my foundation for a beautiful matte finish. The powder is mostly translucent but it does leave just a bit of a light color behind; however, my foundation is about a 1/2 shade on the dark side, so it works out perfectly. On humid summer days, I reapply Mineral Veil to my T-zone to help with oil/shine control.

LOVE	The sweet orange is definitely the dominant scent in this body oil and I love it. The scent is amazing and refreshing, but not overpowering in the least. I can put this on in the morning after my shower and still feel moisturized in the evening. Fortunately, it's not a greasy-feeling oil at all and it absorbs very quickly. It's more of a dry oil that won't stick to your clothes. What I appreciate the most about this product is the pump top. Most pumps splatter products like this everywhere, but this one is very precise. If you want just a little bit, just push it down slightly and you will get just a little. If you want more, push it down harder to get a lot. It's very convenient and I absolutely adore this body oil.

This is the holy grail of mascaras. I am a makeup artist and a skin care specialist. I have tried every mascara out there, and this one, (IF APPLIED PROPERLY) will give you unremarkable results. It not only lengthens your lashes but it adds volume and thickness, with a gorgeous Jet black color. What I also like is, the mascara is long lasting. You apply it once and it stays the way it looked from the first application til 24 hours later. It doesn't flake or crackle, and its very comfortable and light weight. This mascara is definitely worth every penny!	2015-08-01

I use this cleanser in combination with the LUSH herbalism, ocean salt, vanishing cream, and grease lightning.

As a regular tester, I've arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!<br /><br />~ Fragrance: Almost none.<br />~ Feel during application: Smooth, in a thick sort of way. Sort of a makeup primer feel, like it wants to fill in imperfections.<br />~ Feel after absorption: Smooth, moist, like a makeup primer has been applied.<br />~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Should be okay for all, except maybe acne-prone.<br />~ Is it tested on animals?: Unknown.<br />~ Packaging: Nice-looking 2-oz airless pump.<br />~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Leaves my oily skin a little more matte, which is nice, but left my skin feeling very heavy after makeup was applied. Good makeup primer. It does contain ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8 (Argireline) which is a decent wrinkle reducer but only on a short-acting basis - in other words cosmetic.<br />~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Sunscreen is one of the best things you can give your skin. However, despite the claims of 25SPF, I can find no sunscreens in this product. Cyclohexasiloxane, one of the top 3 ingredients, is listed in Canada as harmful to aquatic life. I also fail to see the advertised Matryxl 3000 anywhere in the ingredients. This is basically a bunch of skin conditioners with a few fruit extracts thrown in. Last in the ingredient list are tocopheryl acetate and retinyl palmitate, probably in tiny amounts.<br /><br />This product contains no tint, no sunscreen unless I'm completely missing something, no effective anti-aging ingredients, and primarily a bunch of cosmetic silicones. How this qualifies as a BB cream (typically thought of as a moisturizer, sunscreen, makeup, and skin care all in one) is beyond me.<br /><br />*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don't when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it's more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer.

I'm 28 and have been seriously biting my nails since I was 6 years old. And I mean biting them so low that they bleed and hurt to touch!

After many New Years resolutions to stop biting that weren't met and many different &#34;bad tasting stop biting&#34; products, I've finally found ones that worked!! I wish I had taken a before picture but I honestly didn't expect this to work. That is my nails after a month of not biting!

I received the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System from BzzAgent (free from Crest) to try out for free and review. I loved the easy 2 step system that you can complete in just 2 minutes! First- brush for 60 seconds with Step 1 to leave your teeth feeling clean. Second- brush for 60 seconds with Step 2 to whiten/polish your teeth for a professional clean feeling! I have only been using the product for about 3 weeks and have already seen results. My teeth are noticeably whiter and feel so smooth and clean. The only negative of this product is that it is a little strong and tends to burn my mouth after completing both steps. However, the effects are temporary (less than 15 seconds) and are worth the great results! I would highly recommend the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System to anyone looking to gradually whiten their teeth without the expense of a professional cleaning!	2015-08-01

I've used this kit for years, since the bottles were solid white with black caps. This is still the same formula, don't worry. Cheaper than buying from a regular store. I use this once a week. Make sure you use a timer & follow the instructions. If you try to just guess the time, you will end up with a sore face because you'll get distracted by how good it feels on your skin & end up rubbing it around for 3 minutes. I have very dry, sensitive skin so I don't exfoliate a lot. I have a lot of acne scars, and this helps lighten them. It even helps with existing acne.<br /><br />My only gripe with this product is that I always run out of one before the other. Usually the scrub first. I'm probably using too much though. But you don't really need a lot. To save how much activator you use, rinse the scrub off your hands before that step so you have a little dampness on your hands, and you don't waste activator trying to dissolve the scrub leftover on your fingers. And only use this on a dry face BEFORE a shower. Don't use it after a shower when your skin is still wet & warm or it will hurt. You can use a makeup wipe but only on your eye makeup. This stuff removes face makeup just as well. You don't want any extra moisture on your face.<br /><br />I am head over heels in love with this stuff. I don't splurge on face care, but this is a must-have. I use a $3 aveeno bar & cheap cerave moisturizer. Oh yeah, and don't use any type of special moisturizer after this. Nothing with acids or charcoal or anything that has a special use like &#34;clearing&#34; or &#34;brightening.&#34; Only use a basic gentle moisturizer like cerave. Your skin will be sensitive after, and special face creams could hurt you. After using, dry off your face about 80% of the way so it's slightly damp, then add moisturizer. Your skin will drink it right up and it feels amazing. You will want to sit there for 5 minutes just rubbing it in cause it feels so nice, and your skin will feel so soft you won't wanna keep your hands off it. You might even want to add a 2nd helping of moisturizer. Your makeup will apply so much better, and you won't even need much because this makes your skin bright & fresh looking. If you're an eyebrow-lover, you'll love how easily your pencil or dipbrow glides onto your skin. I actually use this scrub directly on my eyebrows for a few seconds. You're constantly using heavy waxy pomades & pencils on them, and that can cause buildup. This scrub negates that and leaves your brow area super soft.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone of any age or gender. I'm 23 and I started using when I was 17 or 18. You will not regret it. It will probably burn the first few times, but you will get used to it. Try only using each step for 40 seconds the first time instead of the whole minute. And remember, use small, gentle circles. It feels so good that sometimes you want to rub harder but it will hurt. The activator part feels weird but you will get used to that too. To use less activator, tilt your head back and squeeze some directly onto your forehead, cheeks, and chin, then start rubbing in.a keep your hands off it.

I also like the night time one as well. You certainly can't beat the price. I recently tried a fairly expensive one, and ended up back to this.	2015-08-01

The dimensions are small:  when wet, it's less than 3&#34; by 5&#34;.  This is baby size, not adult size.  I've had Konjac sponges before, facial ones, and while the super-soft texture of the sponges -- once they're wet -- is okay for cleansing the face, it does very little for the body.  It feels goopy, and doesn't do a good job.  Not the product I was looking for.	2015-08-01

I received my Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System from Crest to use and review. This system works wonderfully. It actually whitens my teeth and I don't have to sit around with a tray or strips on my teeth. All it takes it 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes in the evening. If you use it as directed I am positive that you will also see results. I am very happy with the way this product whitens. I've had to tell my husband and children to not touch it because they've all seen how white and bright my teeth are. The best thing about this system is that there is no nasty tasting gel. Anyone can whiten their teeth with this product as long as you have 4 minutes a day and a toothbrush!	2015-08-01

I already have a face wash that I love so I wasn't necessarily looking for something to get oil off of my face or anything. I was more excited to have a makeup remover wipe to use. Sadly, these are extremely poor at removing makeup. It kind of just smudged around my eyeliner rather than really REMOVING it. It had the same effect as if you were to remove your makeup with a towel.

I have purchased this Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Dark Circle Eraser many times over the past three years or so.  I have horrible dark circles that nothing seems to cover completely.  This product doesn't cover them completely but it does a decent job and just as good as any other concealer I have tried.  You have to prime the sponge when you first get it by twisting the top until you start to see product appear on the sponge.  To apply you can either swipe it across your dark circles or pat it on them.  It does a great job of lightening any dark areas that you may have.  This is one of my staples and I use it every time I apply makeup.  The product does last a very long time.  I purchased this last one six months ago and I am not even half way through the container yet.	2015-08-01

It has a very pleasant taste and the ultra-violet light is super easy to use. I was excited to have the opportunity to review the MagicBrite and as somebody that has tried out numerous teeth whitening products I found this one to truly be the simplest. It has easily become a part of my daily routine and because of the noticeable difference I have already seen I would definitely recommend it to others.	2015-08-01

This definitely works and the color is great when I put it on, but it does turn green with time, and for me, turned green after activity due to sweating. I am guessing it's a chemical reaction between sweat and the product because ordinarily it's brown for 6+ hours, however turns green over night. But with exercise it turned very green after just an hour . I will still use it and just beware of the green effect when considering a work out. Like anything, your skin could be different as we all have different pH levels . Many reviewers say they never experienced the green effect so, worth a try!	2015-08-01

I leave it on for about 10 minutes but the feeling of heat subsides in about 5 mins. My hands are less painful overall so it must be helping. I set it up on an old microwave cart that I put in the bathroom. You need space for it and the only problem with the cart is it is too high if I want to dip a foot (one foot at a time would fit). I haven't tried that yet but would only move the unit to the floor before plugging it in as you don't want to spill any hot wax! I generally turn the unit on after lunch. It takes nearly 2 hours to melt 5 lbs of wax. I bought Paramed wax on Amazon. 6 lbs was about $25. It's good and very oily so no need to add mineral oil. I only added 5-6 drops of peppermint oil as recommended by my physical therapist. May try adding more but we do notice a slight odor from it. Not unpleasant, just something we are not used to.<br /><br />One thing I cannot tell is whether the interior is plastic or metal. My PT said to get metal as some plastic units leak. Inside and out is all white and when you tap on the inside it sounds more like plastic than metal. But it hasn't leaked after the first week. Overall, happy with it. But be aware it does take some dedicated space, and then commitment to use it regularly. It is easier to do one hand at a time unless you have someone to help cover your second hand. It would be hard to do both hands if you're alone. I do one at a time so I have the other hand free to use my iPad, TV remote or whatever.<br /><br />I believe the product was fulfilled by Amazon, but not sure. In any case, after 5 business days, it had not even been processed for shipping! I contacted Amazon and they expedited it but be aware if you use free shipping, that apparently also means you're at the back of the line for even starting to process your order! Pay for shipping if you're in a hurry. I had the wax within 2 or 3 days and it sat here waiting for the warmer!<br /><br />As others have noted, the instructions are a joke, written by someone with little knowledge of English. Another reviewer wrote out the directions, which was helpful. Also, go to YouTube and a couple of physical therapists have a very good video on how to use it. You must dip your hands or feet at least 5 times to get enough wax layer to provide enough heat. I sometimes do more dips.<br /><br />So my advice is to be aware it takes time to melt the wax, and time to use it daily, or whenever. If you don't have the time, this will just be another dust catcher. But if you can invest the time, it does seem to help arthritis pain. My PT said I'd notice more benefit over time as it reduces inflammation each time you use it.in 2 or 3 days and it sat here waiting for the warmer!<br /><br />As others have noted, the instructions are a joke, written by someone with little knowledge of English.

Also, the color of the shampoo is slightly different. I've checked the barcodes for original Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner and guess what! they where different than this product.	2015-08-01

Natures Super Food Miracle.	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Great Quality!	O the many ways I love Coconut oil… seriously there are so many uses for it! It is amazing! When I first found out about it I flipped out over how much you can do with it, what it helps, what you can substitute it for and the list could go on and on and on!<br /><br />How I used this oil:<br />– A small spoonful in our coffee<br />– In creams, lip balms, or alone on skin, especially for eczema<br />– On hair, it prevents split ends and moisturizes and takes away dandruff<br />– Put it on nails to make them stronger<br />– Weightloss<br />– Use it to fight acne<br />– In baths<br />– In baking just put coconut oil where it calls for other oils<br />– Kills bacteria and viruses<br />– The smell for stress relief<br />– For our feet (makes them soft!!!)<br />– Ear infections<br />– Sunblock<br /><br />This oil stays in it’s solid form here with me but as soon as it’s on my skin it melts. This coconut oil smells just amazing! All coconut oil is amazing but this quality is just Amazing!<br /><br />**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**	2015-08-01

I don't care what your research says, Cepacol is the only thing I've found that helps me when allergies and auto immune problems leave my mouth full of odd sores. I used to use it all the time as preventative and it worked. The last few years, it has not been available locally and stopped using it. Instead, I use a Lidocaine Prescription to ease the pain and allows me to eat, but it has no effect on the sores. Thank God it's here in Anazon! I NEVER got brown teeth from it, perhaps counteracted easily by a good whitening toothpaste. That is a flawed argument against a great product that is gentle, doesn't make tears run down my face upon use and heals these miserable mouth sores which have the doctors completely at a loss. Highly recommended!! In fact, I hope Amazon keeps it in stock so I can depend on finding it here for years to come. Stop finding fault with what is an excellent product that cures a miserable condition which even has the medical profession shrugging their shoulders.This is a wonderful mouthwash. Gentle and no horrible aftertaste that, now that I have found it again, will bring me much needed relief!	2015-08-01

I also bought it for my son who plays pro baseball in the summers, and who has already had Lyme disease once from tick bites. He and his teammates in the bullpen, who also use it, find it to be very effective also.  Just another tip if you use it. Some people have noted that it leaves an oily residue when you spray it on, which I found to be  unpleasantly greasy also. I got around this by not spraying it directly on my skin. Instead I spray it on a folded piece of paper towel and then dab or streak the paper towel on my skin. When the paper towel no longer feels moist I just spray it again, and so on until all exposed skin has been touched. It doesn't go on oily if you do that, but the picardin is so effective that it still works.	2015-08-01

So I decided to invest some more money into a quality anti-hair loss shampoo, and found this to be the most popular in the market.<br />When I finally applied it onto my wet hair, my first impression was 'nothing feels different' and 'will this really work?' Then as I massaged my scalp with it, very fine foam started to form, and it gave a natural, smooth feeling of scalp cleanse. Throughout the entire washing process, I indeed felt no hint of chemical reactions or artificial feeling of freshness, it just felt like a natural wash in a forest, with the slight scent of herbs and aroma. And when I blow-dried my hair afterwards, it had definitely gotten more volume and each strand seemed coated. I was worried the natural formula would render stiff hair, but to my surprise, my hair as a whole felt much softer afterwards, too. I have only used it once so far, but I have a prettty good feeling this shampoo will guard my hair from loss, if not grow, at this rate.	2015-08-01

Eyelash growth serum was recommended to me to strengthen my eyelashes so I would have a good base to adhere to.  This was my first shot at an eyelash serum, and I was skeptical.  I have been using reLASH on one side for a few nights and I can already start to see some changes. I'm hoping that these positive changes continue.  The serum has a nice texture and is fragrance free.  Instructions were clear, leaving me feeling confident about application.<br /><br />I received this, along with other similar serums,  at a discount price so that I could test them and provide an honest evaluation. After trying on my lash line for a few days, I decided to put some on my eyebrow.  The spot on my eyebrow where it was pierced many years ago has always been thinner than the rest of my brows so I'm attempting to grow that part back.  I am also recommending to a friend who has thin eyebrows due to thyroid issues.	2015-08-01

This is the BEST makeup remover I've ever used & I have tried so many. It dissolves all my makeup, even waterproof mascara, while being gentle on my skin and eyes, which are extremely sensitive. I use this on a dry face & wipe it off with a cotton round or wash cloth & I also use it in the shower. It works well either way. I ALWAYS follow with my regular cleanser just to make sure nothing is left behind. This product is extremely gentle yet effective & a tiny bit goes a long way. Others have mentioned this feels greasy & doesn't lather. This is a LOTION. I love that this doesn't dry out my skin & if you don't like the moisture left behind, simply follow with a cleanser. Amazing product I can't live without!	2015-08-01

Makes a great lather, feels luxurious on the face, and results in a very good shave using a double edge razor. This is one of my favorite scents, and Taylor of Old Bond Street is consistently my favorite brand.<br /><br />An important point for me: like most wet shaving products, there are two benefits to this product. First, it makes the skin feel better. Reduces nicks and razor burns and leaves a nice tone to the skin. It is also cost effective. For the price of this shaving cream I could have purchased 4 cans of aerosol shaving cream. But I would have used up the cans when I was half-way through this bowl. And the cans are murder on skin.	2015-08-01

It also doesn't feel greasy like a pomade either. It's the prefect balance of hold and flexibility . I really like it. I know it's for men, but I think I might try it out when I'm going for a beachy wavey look. It's hard to find a product that creates separation and hold that doesn't make your hair crunchy and flaky.

Then as of the past few months, my pits started burning and itching whenever I tried using the deodorant. It got to the point where I ended up going to the walk-in and getting a prescription of steroid cream to get the inflammation back down. The doctor said it looked like a chemical burn and I even got tested for staph due to the inflammation and itching.<br /><br />I went off the deodorant for a while and am now testing it again. Same symptoms are coming back up. Sorry Tom's- I had a good run with your product, but my body can no longer tolerate it. You've lost another customer.	2015-08-01

I have fair skin and is slightly tanned right now, but I'm used to concealers being too dark for my skin. so this was a bit of a surprise. I still really like it and I expect the coloring to be an exact match in winter. I love the spongy brush thing on the tip, it really does apply the concealer very nicely.  This does cover up my dark circles pretty decently, although I feel like my concealer stick does just about the same job. The main difference I see between them is that the Age Rewind doesn't feel as heavy on my skin, like my concealer stick does.  I will likely purchase this again in the future.	2015-08-01

While the container does last for a while, $40 is just too outrageous of a price for a bronzer that is not even my holy grail item. Don't get me wrong, this product is perfect for a contour that is natural and easy to blend, but since I have sensitive skin, it causes me to have minor break outs. However, after finding this for a way more reduced price, the product has more appeal. If you're a beginner at contouring, this bronzer will allow you to experiment for the results you desire. Don't go out and buy this at Sephora when you can get the same item at a far more discounted price from this seller!	2015-08-01

Really never had a successful twist-0ut, braid-out, bantu knot, wash no go etc..Anthony Dickeys method of doing EVERYTHING IN the shower with SOAKING WET HAIR AND USING PRODUCTS GENEROUSLY has provided me with the most beautiful wash n go EVER.....people that complain about the HARD/crunchy hair probably used to much because you don't need much but most styling gels will create this but all you have to do is scrunch your hair either with an oil or just use your fingers.  That HARD feeling is just the cast that a styling product provides, it can be removed easily by scrunching your hair with fingers......this product does produce flaking when I am crunching...but not to the point where I would rate this product less than a 5!  After I remove that CAST of hard hair, I have beautiful SoFT curls.....it took ME - a year and a half of being natural and thousands of dollars later to realize that I have found what works for me!  I have never  seen my curl pattern look like this......I contributed this to the Anthony Dickey method for sure but this product is what I have used with his method....I in love with my with curl pattern now!  I used to hate my curl pattern!!!!!  please look him up and his method if you have watched hours of youtubers with no real results.....................	2015-08-01

It's not a strong scent but good enough to turn the basement into a spa. Helps my nose and calms the pets. I use felt fabric by tracing the padding so I have plenty of refill pads. I only use it for 15 mins at the most to help the ordor and turn it off when I leave for work.<br />What I like about this too, you can plug in any room at the most decrete place. Like most candle burning aromatherapy, you worry about refilling the water or replacing the tea candle before it dries out or burns out. I like the fact you can plug it in the car. It's small but gives enough scent for just 5 drops. Not expensive too.	2015-08-01

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT AND ESPECIAL QUALITY<br /><br />Bentonite is one of the most effective and powerful healing clays. It can be used externally as a clay poultice, mud pack or in the bath and, in skin care recipes. This is a good quality Bentonite grey/cream in color, very fine, velveteen feel and is odorless and non-staining because it came from aged volcanic ash. I use it in my skin because bentonite has strong negative charge when hydrated which bonds to the positive charge in many toxins, heavy metals, impurities and chemicals, absorbing them.<br /><br />How I use it as well you can do:<br /><br />I apply a past of bentonite clay and water on any skin irritation like blemishes, insect bites, cuts, skin itching, or burns. I leave it on until it dries and wash off after several minutes. This is said to be especially calming to skin itching from eczema, psoriasis, viral rash, active acne, etc.<br />For smooth and healthy face skin, leave on for 20 minutes and wash off. I typically do this twice a week.<br />I sometimes add about 1/4 cup of Bentonite Clay to a bath for a relaxing detox bath that softens skin.<br /><br />A slight redness may appear after removing the clay. This is normal and will disappear in approximately 30minutes.<br /><br />But which is better, sodium or calcium bentonite?<br />Sodium bentonite expands when wet, absorbing as much as several times its dry mass in water. So, to remove dirty stuffs this is the best<br /><br />Calcium bentonite is a useful adsorbent for fats and oils because the main active ingredient of fuller earth, so for oil skin take it for you<br /><br />Good product, take the chance to improved you skin and health	2015-08-01

Partially genetics, partially life choices/diet. I truly feel tat masks really have helped my skin. I had used the mask about three times with positive results. It seemed to &#34;reset&#34; my skin. Moisturizing it and helping to clear it any active, mature break outs.<br /><br />About a week ago, I had the worst breakout that I can remember. I could attribute it to a couple of things. My skin was red, painful, and irritated. I picked at it to the point of making myself bleed. The other day, I got home from work and applied a thin coat to my severely affected areas. Usually, I leave it on for an hour or so. This time, because my face was so broken out, I left it on while I slept.<br /><br />When I woke up, the results weren't miraculous, but exponentially better. My face wasn't as red and my bigger pimples started to dry up and shrink. I just applied a thick coat all over my face and it feels better. This really does work (again, no miraculous results for me) and I definitely plan to repurchase.	2015-08-01

I first bought the Brilliant range, which is absolutely amazing.<br />But I live in a very dry climate and needed extra moisture. So I ended up getting the Dry Remedy range.<br /><br />I've read reviews of this products, and people don't give it justice, for the simple reason, I think that they do not know hot to properly use it.<br />You need a small amount, make it foam in your hands, then apply. After applying, had some water, then massage into the scalp and the length of the hair. Repeat this process once more. Then, use the conditionner. Leave it in for 3-4 minutes and rinse thoroughly. Finally, use the oil. And voilà, smooth, silky and tamed hair. This is seriously and amazing products for those in need of extra moisture.	2015-08-01

It claims to protect you for up to 48 hours from odor and wetness, but I found it only works for me for 24 hours on a low-key day and 12 hours during an active day.  I had mixed feelings about the clear gel.  I liked that it didn't leave behind white streaks on my shirts, but was a little annoying with how slow it dried.  Overall, it is an okay product.

By the end of the roll I seem to have gotten bacteria on it and it was transferring the smell to me whereas a more commercial deodorant would destroy bacteria.<br />Pros: This is a beautiful smelling, high-quality product.

Doesn't act like a &#34;natural&#34; shampoo -- because it isn't. Take a look at the ingredients. I thought this would be gentle on my fine hair (man) like other natural shampoos but it's ended up drying out and making my hair frizzy for the first time in my life. Purchased this not really doing any background research, just trusted the Kiss My Face brand to some extent.  But I guess I can't do that anymore.  Do yourself a favor and do a cursory search and learn about C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, the primary detergent of this shampoo. Not really a gentle cleansing agent. And the third ingredient is salt?? Huh?	2015-08-01

The first clue was that the package return address was from a media company. The second giveaway: the scent. I adore the scent of the real thing. The scent on this is different. It's not unpleasant - a little like the original, but more like a man's cologne smell. The proof is in the results, though. And my results were just terrible. I have fine, wavy, below shoulder length hair that I blow dry straight. With the original, I use one pump and my hair is smooth and conditioned after blow drying, with a great scent that stays in my hair. After several uses of this, my hair was frizzy and dry each time. No smoothing or conditioning results at all, and the scent disappeared completely after drying. I read all the reviews before I purchased this, and saw that many thought it was a fake. But I was also surprised to find that some reviewers found the legitimate one I purchased a few years ago to be a fake: http://www.amazon.com/MoroccanOil-Hydrating-Styling-10-2-Ounce-Bottle/dp/B002CMLS50/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1438450747&sr=1-1&keywords=morrocanoil+styling+cream .

This is a good way to try out the brand's line without committing to hundreds of dollars worth of product that you might not even be able to use. For instance, I have found for my skin this is really too many steps that make no difference. I like the product itself, I had no allergies and it made my face soft and bright - but- using the essence, lotion, cream and eye cream did not seem to make it any better than using just the essence and lotion. I have already repurchased a toner from this brand as I liked how it removed the last traces of makeup without dryness or irritation. I am also planning to repurchase the essence and a lotion.	2015-08-01

The first time I wore this it melted off my face and I couldn't understand why.  I gave it another shot and used a different applicator than the one sent with this and it worked great.  It glided on easily and stayed put all day.  I am currently using a thinner angled applicator for this and it works great for me, I think less is the key for this stuff.  If you apply too much it smears and melts.  I will definitely buy this again.	2015-08-01

My routine usually consists of washing my face in the shower, followed by one of these lovelies when I get out and a good moisturizer on the dry prone areas of my face and lightly on the rest of my face. At night, I'll admit I'm lazy and I'll use one or two of these to get my face nice and clean, again followed by moisturizer.  My skin has never looked better, and I've been struggling with acne forever! These are a must have for me!	2015-08-01

My skin gets dry every easily(especially my ankles and elbows). First off, I LOVE that it doesn't have a strong odor,  I did think it was going to smell more like honey, or have a sweeter smell to it than it actually did, but that is ok with me since we have sensitivity to strong smells in my home. Secondly, it goes on the skin very smooth and doesn't feel too greasy or oily which is great, I don't like to feel like my skin is oily from a product, I normally steer clear from ones who feel greasy. Third, it makes my skin feel very moisturized and look great! It absorbs very well with little dry time.<br />I  do think the packaging is very appealing to the eye, a lot of people judge an item based on how it looks and the reviews they can find through the internet.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I received this item at a reduced cost from the manufacturer to give my honest and nonbiased opinion.	2015-08-01

This is a thicker cream that initially wanted to use on my neck area but found it just very thick and took a bit more working in that I was willing to do. I'm not sure why I tried it on my feet but I worked it in and put socks on for the night. Wow did this work amazing well for this area.  I've tried other lotions and creams and find that they seem to sink into my socks more than my skin.  I'm not sure way this worked so well but my feet in the morning just felt soft and smooth, a welcome change in the morning.<br />I had a coupon code that reduced the cost for me but this review is based on my personal experience.  I may not have used the product as intended but I fond that it worked well for me as a foot cream.	2015-08-01

I don't know if Arid changed temporarily, or if the inactive ingredients are different, or maybe it only works for a while, then fails.  The dispenser on these is way better.<br /><br />The bigges plus here is that it doesn't have C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, which causes my skin to itch after a few hours, and for a few days.  Also, it doesn't have Zinc Ricinoleate, which causes my underarms to peel.  This DOES have Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex at 19%.  Anything 15-20% of AZT works well for me.	2015-08-01

I have searched and searched high end brands for a concealer that works like this one. When I became vegan a month ago, I threw out ALL of my makeup that tested on animals and that included harmful chemicals for my skin. I searched on Amazon for a natural, cruelty free concealer since I get acne, and tried this one. The color is PERFECT and the consistency so creamy! It goes onto my skin beautifully and stays all day, especially when I set it with translucent powder. I just placed an order for another one to keep in my purse. Love it!!	2015-08-01

I have super sensitive skin and also somehow ALWAYS end with stains on shirts from deoderant so I have to use the clear gels. Sadly most of them aren't nearly as effective as the stick deoderants... This stuff is even better! You use very little and cover your whole under arm area. It dries. Then all day you don't even begin to smell any odor at all.<br /><br />I shower at least once a day, sometimes twice on a hot day where i've done some work. Somehow even though my hygeine is very good- halfway thru the day or towards the end of it, I notice my deoderant starts failing me. And it's just been impossible to find one that I can use and it works out. (Both because of the sensitive skin and some of them just don't begin to actually work at all). The clinical strengeth stuff dries my skin out and is overly expensive... So I tried this on a whim and all I can say is I hope they keep on making this! Not trying any other kinds, this is the one! =)	2015-08-01

You could blow the leaves out of your back yard with this thing! It's awesome. I've never found a more powerful dryer that dries my hair faster than this one can.  I have medium length hair, very thick, and with other dryers it usually takes 20 minutes or so to dry it. Not so with this thing, usually takes about 4 or 5 minutes at the most. Seriously.

Ok, I am a huge fan of the Tanwise lotion so I thought I'd give the mousse a try. There's nothing wrong with the lotion - it just takes me awhile to apply. I heard good things about the mousse but it didn't live up to the hype. I used it two or three times but could not get it to give me a good color. Im pale, too, so it's not that hard. I bought the same shade that I get in the lotion- fair to medium - but this didn't do it for me. It also had a strange green tint to it. I put on a few layers and followed the instructions but I could not get it to work for me. Long story short : Tanwise will give you a nice, non orange tan, but you should go for the lotion.	2015-08-01

I've been using this on the little one's naturally curly hair for about 3 weeks. Unfortunately I am probably going to look for another brand. It has an alcohol scent which doesn't smell bad, but the little one definitely prefers something more floral, fruity for her hair. No reflection on the product, just a personal choice. I also found the pump to be extremely hard to operate. This is my biggest gripe. I mean I can hardly apply any pressure at all no matter how hard I press it and when I can only a little is able to escape. It takes me so long to finish her hair because I literally am struggling just to get a small amount out of the can. Knowing that I still have 3 more cans is a little daunting (I bought a pack of 4). The mousse itself works great once you get it out of the can.	2015-08-01

Read the reviews so far, and thought I would share my thoughts. Now, I just got them today (August 1, 2015). So, I have no idea if they are going to work or not. But here's what I do know so far. They fit just fine on my toes. I have not tried them with shoes on yet, but I never wear shoes, unless I am going to work or out in public where a lack of shoes would be gross. Anyway, I am also a great believer in foot reflexology. And where these &#34;magnets&#34; (I don't know if they are, or if they just put pressure on the spot they cover) set is directly in line with some useful pressure points. Those spots move the energy thru all of the organs they need to get to, to promote weight loss, and just general good health. And ya know what, the power of the mind is unbelievable. If you KNOW something is going to work, it will. Because you are using your energies to help it along. If you are sitting there thinking I am some hippy dippy new-ager.... I am not a new ager, but happily I am hippy dippy. And the times I have had accupressure and foot reflexology, and how amazing I feel after, I am going to give these a shot, see what happens. Will review again once I have some experience.   Still August 1, 2015: I wore these out to the grocery store, and no, they are not great to walk on. The &#34;metal thing&#34; on the bottom is not completely comfortable. That was wearing shoes tho. Barefoot at home, for most of the morning, into mid afternoon, no problems at all. Will update on progress(or not).	2015-08-01

This has a pleasant smell, goes on ok, and you only have to keep it on for 5 minutes.  I've never had any adverse reaction to it or dryness.

Some people say that they don't think it's doing anything and I can see where they are coming from.  I didn't think it was doing much either but when I went for a couple of months without it, then went for a facial, she could tell.	2015-08-01

I bought this along with Radha Tea Tree Oil to make henna paste for body art. The henna was very pleasant looking/ smelling and obviously was stored properly to keep it fresh. It did have a date on it (it was the most recent crop, Nov 2014). It was very finely crushed and I had no problem making a nice smooth paste with it. I let my paste mature for about 30 hrs (I did stir it a few times during the maturation, I don't know if that changes things or not, but I was nosy). I let the paste dry on my skin for about 12 hours after I sealed it with lemon juice and sugar. It made a super dark coffee brown stain after it oxidized for a day. If you are looking for BAQ henna, this is the real deal. I made 2 cones using 1/4 cup (20 grams) of henna. One cone would be big enough to do both hands (within reason). A little math means I could make 10 cone out of this little bag for less than 10 bucks! A great deal by any standard. Would buy again.	2015-08-01

I've used the Batiste original dry shampoo for a while. I decided to try another scent so I got the Fresh.

I had very high eyes for this, eyeliner is pretty much my staple for life and I was hoping to get another thick, dark eyeliner that I could reapply during long work days without it getting smudged and faded cause of reuse. First of all, the applicator is very wobbly... I had to hold the applicator at the very end to even get a semblance of a straight line. I struggled with this much longer than I would a typical pencil which irked me to no end. After I applied it and moisturized my face, my eyelids started tingling. I dismissed it and went to work. An hour into my workday, my eyelids were still tingling and I gently tapped one of them and it hurt. I rushed to the bathroom and outwardly, I looked fine. The eyeliner was a bit heavy for 9am, but I'm a retired emo kid. However, my 11am it was so uncomfortable to blink or look around, I finally went in and washed my face completely bare. I waited until lunchtime to reapply the eyeliner, and the burning came back. I don't have particularly dry skin or sensitive skin but I do have small patches of eczema. Regardless of what it was, I won't be using this eyeliner again.<br />I received this product in exchange for a review.	2015-08-01

Like everything EXCEPT the back side of thes that hits the roller when in use and may eventually need to somehow trim it out to prevent that. It rubs the rollers and so far I haven't seen any damage to the rollers or even the back bar but it's a POOR DESIGN. Actually a BIG DESIGN FLAW. The cheaper models and other brands do not have that annoyance. Otherwise this model is identical to the womens UGLY PINK version so if you want a less yucky color with a little more sophistication to it...this one was my choice. The MAN does not mean it's any more sturdy or stronger just a different color package ladies. And frankly a heck of a lot better than everything a sickly pink or worse puke pastel blue. Ok purple is over done too.	2015-08-01

Warning: if you leave it wrapped up the scent will stay. Besides that, they are absolutely fabulous!	2015-08-01

My wife is so glad because I got this in exchanged for a product review. Not that she really need it because she's still young 24 years old, so I don't really think she need all this anti-aging cream. But you know what most women want to try new products they think that will make them look even better. So far she is loving this product specifically for her eye as she has been constantly complaining about her eye bugs that she gets by sleeping late because of work. I would recommend this for all the women out there.	2015-08-01

But if you ever price out a good, single make-up brush you will quickly see how the price of a quality brush goes on its own. By the time you add up the number of brushes in this set, plus the great carry case, this becomes a good value.<br /><br />The brushes are really nicely made. They do start with a bit of an odor - like glue but that dissipates. The brushes are super soft and have perfect tapers and round edges. The sizes are great as well. From a large blush brush to a small eye contour brush. The case has just enough spots to keep these wrapped up and safe with a snap closure.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.	2015-08-01

I say this because it is effective, super portable, and affordable. I have oily skin in my &#34;T-zone&#34; area, so I tend to look very shiny in photos during a night out. Thankfully, I've found a quick solution to that. Since this pack of oil absorbing sheets is so tiny, I can stash it LITERALLY anywhere. From my purse, to even my bra, this pack of sheets goes unseen! You can just quickly pull these out from the package, and blot your typical areas of oiliness, and the oils will be soaked into the sheet, and your face will appear more matte. You can tell if you're applying the proper amount of pressure when blotting when you see that the area you've been pressing becomes more translucent on the sheet. Since discovering this product, I've never had to suffer from oily photographs of me again haha!	2015-08-01

My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong fragrances.<br /><br />I replaced deodorant with a crystal body deodorant stick which works for me. This summer I decided to use this Tom's of Maine Deodorant because it is also an antiperspirant. This is something my crystal stick doesn't offer. I solely intend to use it for hot days when I may perspire the most.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It does control my perspiration which is what I wanted.<br />The natural powder fragrance is nice since more fragrances annoy me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Will stain dark clothes with a white residue like most deodorants.<br />One has to scrub harder to remove the deodorant from the armpit.<br /><br />Will I use this product again? Yes but only during the hottest months of the year. I plan on returning to my crystal deodorant that still keeps odors away. I don't mind light perspiration since I think it's healthy for the body. I'm glad I tried this product. It's an option.<br /><br />Who should use this product? Well it depends on your needs and issues with deodorants.	2015-08-01

I paid $29.99 for this trimmer and it is MUCH worse than the trimmer that I've been using for the past two years. It is not powerful enough to actually trim hair. The only trimming it can handle is trimming my face before I use a razor, which my older trimmer actually does better. The nose trimmer is the only reason I have not thrown this away yet, but I'll still probably end up throwing it away fairly soon.	2015-08-01

I've had it for exactly 1 months, and only missed about 4 days of application. In that time Ive used about half the bottle, 3 squirts per day. So I expect this whole bottle to last about 2 months. I shower, towel dry, put underwear on, then apply this. I am receding and thinning on the front, so I apply 1 squirt in the middle, and one on each side. I do have thicker hair where I have it, so it absorbs pretty quickly. I will say applying as much as possible may work faster but you're gonna need to be rich to afford it. Also, applying mostly to the scalp is a joke, you hair will conveniently soak most of it up.<br /><br />That said, I do still notice the tingling on my head for about 5 minutes. I have noticed that the hair is filling in. The small hairs make the hair appear &#34;thicker&#34; because there is less white and more dark (I have almost black hair). I do honestly believe some of the hair is growing back. I had a couple (like 10) hairs up front and then a patch behind them that was completely bare, and then the rest of my hair. That patch is now filling in with a bunch of hair.<br /><br />I will be trying another bottle based on my current results, and will continue if result continue. Now that I have seen some results, I am worried about burn out. Like, will it fry my hair if I use this continuously for the rest of my life? I have no basis for that, just a fear.	2015-08-01

I must go through about 2 tubes of this stuff a month.  I'm working through my second 12pk.  Good deal!  (Someone mentioned it gooping up their pillow case so they don't use this anymore.

I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have acne-prone, combination skin that leans more towards the dry side. This moisturizer does not leave my skin feeling dry or tight like some other moisturizers that I have used and it does not sit on top of my skin like a greasy mess. It sinks in leaving my skin moisturized and feeling soft and supple. I do feel it aids in the healing of my acne break outs and has helped my post acne inflammation (PAI) heal quicker. My PAI used to last up to several months and now it is taking a few weeks at most for it to disappear.<br /><br />It has not cured my acne but I really don't think any one thing is the cure. I personally feel my acne is a hormonal issue which needs to be addressed internally.<br /><br />The price is more than I would normally pay but I have no problem paying for it. I love that it is made of natural ingredients, including healthy probiotics, and that it provides such great results. I definitely plan on buying more when this runs out and I want to try some other moisturizers created by ASDM.	2015-08-01

Well I'll start off by saying this is a solid dupe for the infamous Naked palettes by Urban Decay. However, unlike Urban Decay's usual fine ingredients this particular product broke me up and at first I wasn't too sure. I loved the colors but I had to stop wearing it due to minor breakouts. If you do not have sensitive skin, I recommend this to save bucks. If you do, I would advise paying more for better quality. The only other con was my cover broke after two weeks so it didn't hold up. It did come in order though so that was a good thing.	2015-08-01

I use this every night and I rub it very gently on my face. This does not irritate my skin nor was it drying. Makes my face super smooth and soft. The main problem are the ingredients in this product. I enjoyed this product when I was using it but dermatologists have said that walnut shell powder in this product is very harmful to the skin. Even though I don't feel that this is too harsh for my skin, I don't want to take any risks however, I still took the risk to finish the product up.	2015-08-01

Love this product! The whole set has this amazing fresh and clean smell. It's heavenly. I was nervous about the dry shampoo because I am used to a spray dry shampoo and this was literally a powder you sprinkle on your hair. But I think the powder formula might be more effective. My oily hair looked so much fresher and less oily from this dry shampoo. I have black hair so the white powder did take quick a few brush strokes to disappear. But no biggie there. I do wish the cute little powder puff for the body veil fit somewhere in the container. I know I will lose it eventually. Would def recommend this set.

Beauty	5	1	1	N	N	self leveling top coat you will love it please read my review	Hi everyone I would like to start off by saying my brother-in-law owns this company his late grandfather started it long ago they have been around for a very long time. I have had the privilege of getting a chance to try a lot of the products and they are all of much higher quality then they use in nail salons. Unfortunately most of there professional products you can't buy unless your licensed. Now these top costs the northern lights are fabulous the only Glitter topcoat that is self leveling that's why you have to shake it up every time you use it but it sinks on your nails giving you a smooth shinny finish. No need for additional topcoat over it. And there acrilic powder and monimer are way better and easier on your nails that is very important to them to have top quality way less damaging to your nails. And there monimer is way less stinky and not harch smelling. I do my nails in my house all the time and no one complains about the smell I actually like it :) the out the door line is so great it drys in 45sec I love that as I hate waiting for my nails to dry I always mess them up because I start doing stuff to soon you guys know lol :D so I love out the door topcoats from inm super shiny wet look when dry. I'm not just saying this because the owner is my bro in law I've tryed a lot of the products and they are all top notch. I hope this has been helpful to you guys. One more thing about this glitter topcoat the self leveling glitter is like a fine dust it never looks chunky it looks very nice on top of any color it drys fast so if you want it to look more glittery you don't have to wait for ever to do a 2nd coat.	2015-08-01

This hair had a really bad smell, but once you wash the hair it goes away. But, make sure you wash it good. I ordered a 16, 18, 20 inches.  My hair was pretty long. I suggest ordering 4 bundles if you want you hair nice and full with no leave out. If your leaving hair out 2 to 3 bundles is sufficient. I love the curl pattern, and the hair is good quality. You just have to take care of it. And, when it's wet it's beautiful. It goes right back to the natural curl. I would order it again.	2015-08-01

I was not so much into the idea of adding oil to my already oily hair. I live most of the time in an extremely dry climate and I was until then unable to find a natural product to moisturize my hair, so I gave this a go. And what a wonderful surprise !!!!!<br /><br />After blowdrying my hair, I put 5-10 drop (I have a LOT of volume) in my hand then distribute it from the roots to the ends. This isn't greasy at all, it dries and disappears, leaving your hair soft, sleek and so so smooth. I first used it with Brilliant (love love love) then with the complete Dry Remedy range and it's just as amazing.<br /><br />You can get this with your eyes closed. You'll never regret it.	2015-08-01

When I first got this product it was wonderful. I'm in my 50s and still have breakouts.  I have sensitive skin and the soft brissells worked great and really helped my skin. You don't need to use too much pressure and let the tips of brush do most of the work. The problem is when I  went to change the batteries some water leaked in making a mess of the batteries.  I dried everything out put new batteries in but now the on/off switch doesn't work. It is stuck on so I can't turn off. I know it says water resistant but I  have never submerged it in water. I did use in shower but description says that's OK to do. I hate to buy another but I  miss using it. UPDATE: As suggested in the reply, I contacted the company and their service was stellar! They replaced my facial brush and sent it priority mail at no cost to me. I'm so happy to get a new one. My face is happier too.	2015-08-01

I'm very happy with this hair mask as it makes my hair feel soft and has a pleasant smell.

He feels that it is good gel that is ruined by an overpowering fragrance. I have to agree, the smell is super strong. It would not be unpleasant if it was not so potent but it is easily 10 times stronger than it needs to be.  His normal gel is LA Looks. This one leaves his hair less crunchy but again... the smell ruins it.

Add to that all the running around I do, and you can imagine how much I sweat back there. I have tried pretty much every deodorant out there and still haven't found one that works the way I want it to. Until I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I received it to try for free from BzzAgent, and I loved it.  This is, hands down, the best deodorant I've ever used. It does everything I need it to. It lasts through twelve hour shifts. It dries quickly after putting it on. I usually prefer solid deodorant, because I hate feeling wet under my arms, but it dries so fast that it's a non issue. There is no residue or stains.  I smell fresh and clean all day. I couldn't think of a better test to put this deodorant to than a long, sweaty shift at work, and it passed every test. With flying colors!	2015-08-01

It did absorb but I was still aware of having something on my facet and it is a little sticky.  It moisturizes my hands well and it doesn't feel heavy like it does on my face.  Plus, it smells like grain and that is not as noticeable on my hands.  If you have very dry facial skin, this will likely work well on your skin because the oiliness will help seal in some of the moisture.  It might be too much for normal or oily skin.

It does seem to plump up my facial skin and looks very nourished and makes the makeup look even better and go on nicer. Feels good on the hands, chest and arms , those areas seem to soak in quicker. It has a slight olive oil type odor at first but I do not find that offensive. I have not tried on feet and legs yet but I imagine it will work as well. Nice to have all natural product on the skin.	2015-08-01

After deciding to try phytoceramides I purchased this product because it was one of the most natural (plus I am a vegetarian and so anything with gelatin ingredients was out). It also seemed that rice-derived was better than wheat-derived. After reading other reviews it seems results are not seen quickly and so I purchased several months supply to give it a fair try. Also why I waited for a few months to provide a review. I already use products on my face and so decided the rest of my body (particularly the back of my hands) was the best place to gauge. l have not used any hand cream in the past few months either, to create a more 'controlled test'. I perceive that my skin is feeling less dry and the back of my hands seems less dry also. I believe this product has improved the moisture levels in my skin however I will have a firmer conclusion in another few months. The only negative of this product is the 'tamper-proof' seal, which is not tamper proof at all. Great customer service though.	2015-08-01

It does the job of a beard oil as well as that of a cologne and my lady loves because I actually use a couple drops on my head and I was able to get rid of that distinctive &#34;head-smell&#34; that seems to emanate from my hair when I least expect it (big plus).<br />I'm glad I found a cosmetic product that I can trust and actually enjoy at the same time. Thanks guys for caring about the little things that make a big difference and keep up the great work we appreciate it.<br /><br />Genuinely,<br /><br />Eliesel	2015-08-01

These have changed and not for the better. I have used these for years (approx 15) and nothing else would hold my thin hair back and away with out being to bulky and loosening.

Of course they worked like a charm. Once I realized I could not fine them at Target anymore, I searched online. I was so stoked to have found them.

These brushes are really soft. I washed them as recommended before using them the first time and no hairs came out. After using them for a while I still haven't seen any hairs fall out. I recently went from great skin to a horrible adult acne breakout. I had been using my previous brushes forever, so I figured maybe it was time to get a new set. While my old brushes turned out not to be the source of my acne these are still wonderful and I'm glad I got new ones. There are A LOT of brushes here and I only use about half of them. But for the price who cares? And the concealer brush doesn't do the best job of blending in concealer (more like wiped it off the blemish you're trying to conceal). But again, for the price, who cares? I can easily afford to buy a concealer brush to replace it. For such soft brushes that are easy to use and clean I'm not worried about one being a dud. I also wish though that there was a liquid foundation brush. It's not a huge deal that it's missing because I have a beauty sponge. But it would be nice because one of my liquid foundations work better with a brush than the sponge. But, again, something I'm not all that concerned about. I wash these AT LEAST once a week (sometimes more) with castile soap or shampoo and they've held up great. Soft clean brushes don't aggravate my acne which is wonderful.	2015-08-01

This is one of the worst product I have ever used. It was incredibly expensive and a tremendous waste of money. The mask is absolutely disgusting. Despite the sales persons demonstration at the store, which of course worked perfectly, the mask he sent me home with sticks to my face like glue. Even after scrubbing with a washcloth and using additional cleanser in the shower I still feel bits and pieces of the mask on my face. I am so sad that I wasted my hard earned money on this absolute garbage.	2015-08-01

Then I'm guessing your hair is as damage as my hair. Even blow drying, coloring, bleaching, and spraying hairspray can all damage hair over time. Most gal spray on thermal protectant before applying heat directly on the hair but many of us don't. It just simply not in our routine. I started using Argan oil on my hair after I was googling ways to make damage hair healthy. Some article came up talking about using Argan oil to repair hair, and put back the shine. I went on Amazon and found this Argan oil and read the reviews. I decided to give it a try with my hair dry or wet, once a day. My hair never felt this way-it was so soft! So manageable and not greasy at all. I have not try it on my skin but if it can make my damage hair feel this way, I sure my skin will feel even better. I am not hook on Argan oil.<br /><br />*Received product at a discounted price for an exchange of an honest review.	2015-08-01

I'm so glad I purchased my cartridge from them. So here's what happened...<br />I received my cartridge the other day, opened it and had to try it out immediately. It worked great. A few days later I got myself all geared up to do my treatments on some other areas but I kept getting an error message regarding the color of my skin (which is pasty white). I was frustrated and called the Silk N' company to find out what I could do to fix the issue. I had already tried everything the representative said to do, but still it didn't work. I got on Amazon and contacted the seller of the cartridge Beauty By Choice and set in place a replacement. They immediately put the replacement in the mail and had it delivered in a day or two and I was to return the defective one. So, here's the kicker. While waiting for the replacement, I decided to give the supposed defective one another try, but in the same room I was in when it worked. To make a long story short it worked. I was the one doing something wrong. Now I know I was in too bright of a room and the sensor was picking up my shadow thinking it was dark skin. Although I had tried this the other day, the light was still too bright. I felt like an idiot and immediately contacted Beauty By Choice to let them know what had happened and that I was going to keep the cartridge I thought was defective as well as the replacement. I asked them to first, please forgive me and that it was my mistake, and to please charge me for the replacement. I received the nicest and most generous reply. They were very understanding and said to please keep the replacement as a gift. Who does that anymore? It's so very hard to find good customer service let alone such kindness and generosity.<br /><br />So, I'm here to tell anyone having problems with their cartridge, try doing your treatments in a not so bright room. Don't give up as I did. Also, know that you're buying your cartridge from a great company with the highest integrity. I couldn't be happier.the highest integrity. I couldn't be happier.	2015-08-01

She said she would recommend this product to anyone older.	2015-08-01

Cuts hair well, very easy to use, broke after one cleaning.<br /><br />I ordered this trimmer a month ago and used it successfully for 3 weeks.  When it was time to shave again, I decided to rinse out some hair that had become trapped inside.  While rinsing under the sink with the trimmer on to help vibrate the hair out, the motor died almost entirely.  When switched on, it can still be felt vibrating, but it is almost imperceptible.  You can hear it humming more than anything.<br /><br />I thought this might be a battery issue, so I let it recharge for several hours, sit for a couple of days, everything.  Motor is still dead.  Not sure how water is able to kill a device that is supposed to be water proof, but make sure to take care cleaning yours.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I decided to clean it for the first time one day after I would have been able to return it.  I probably averaged about $5 per shave, which is still cheaper than a barbershop I guess.	2015-08-01

I've used Norelco rotary shavers for almost 40 years.  My last one was the Architec which, unlike it predecessors, did a terrible job on the flat neck hairs and, unlike it predecessors, you could not remove the cutters meaning it was almost impossible to clean well.  Running it in a small bowl of alcohol cleaned some of it but. . . .<br />The Braun gives me the best shave I've ever had.  It shaves as smoothly as a blade, at least for me.  With a bunch of acne scars, blades just don't work on my face so finding an electric that shaves this well with absolutely no irritation is wonderful.  Wish I had made the switch a long time ago.  Well worth the money.	2015-08-01

I first bought the Brilliant range, which is absolutely amazing.<br />But I live in a very dry climate and needed extra moisture. So I ended up getting the Dry Remedy range.<br /><br />I've read reviews of these products, and people don't give it justice, for the simple reason, I think that they do not know hot to properly use it.<br /><br />You need a small amount, make it foam in your hands, then apply. After applying, had some water, then massage into the scalp and the length of the hair. Repeat this process once more. Then, use the conditionner. Leave it in for 3-4 minutes and rinse thoroughly. Finally, use the oil. And voilà, smooth, silky and tamed hair. This is seriously and amazing products for those in need of extra moisture.	2015-08-01

The product is excellent, the shipper shipped it immediately so I received the shampoo much faster than I expected.  However, the shipper needs to secure the lid on the bottle better....  about 1/4 of the product leaked out and I tried to save as much as possible, but never the less, it was messy and a costly shampoo ended up costing me more money in loss.  I do have to say that even when I travel now, I have gotten to the point to secure the lids on my shampoo and conditioner with mailing packaging tape.... THAT seems to work for me.  Also, PLEASE know I thought the shipper did a SUPER job of getting it to me quickly and the ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the loss of product.<br /><br />Thank you.....................

Exited and tried it as directed not one change in a week nothing 20 days. well tried to return it needed a printer I guess, now today i tried to return it and amazon now says no longer qualifys. Well at least this shows proof i speak the truth, cause I would have known and familiarized myself on t he return policy.  So Im not just dissapointed in the item Amazon is to blame as well at least in my eyes they could careless for the small guys or single parent business is business. Im out of 25 dollars and my dream of having perky breast all over again. Now remember this product comes with positive reviews maybe it something in their genes like something i missed.  what will work for me  plastic surgery which aint happening unless i win the lottery.  good luck ladies if you buy this item.

Knowing that my skin really hearts maunka honey and that it's not the cheapest ingredient, I prefer to leave this on my face for a good while whenever possible to let my skin really soak up the honeyed nourishment and let the product act as both cleanser and mini-mask. When I rinse off, my skin tone is more is more calm and even, pores and fine lines less noticeable. And with solid healers like aloe and manuka high on the ingredients list and no aggravating sulfates or artificial fragances to worry about, I also find this helpful applied as a spot treatment on any lingering irritations and bumps I may have. I'm glad to have this cleanser in my cabinet and, based on this offering, look forward to exploring more of Sweet Spot's products down the road.

I have baby-fine, bra-strap-length hair that gets disgustingly greasy 24 hours after a wash. I've been searching for years for a volumizing shampoo that would really work on my hair - particularly one that would provide volume that lasts more than an hour or so after a blow-dry. I read a raving review about how amazing and life-changing this shampoo is, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. Not to mention, I've tried other TRESemme shampoos and LOVED them (the shampoo AND the price tag!) so I had faith that maybe this shampoo would be *the one* that I've been looking for.<br /><br />Well, it's not.<br /><br />My hair is probably more flat and limp than it's been in the past ten years. If I blow-dry my hair, it looks great for about 20 minutes, at which point all volume goes away, and my hair is flat against my head again.

You can use it to create a &#34;wet wrap&#34; to get moisture deeper into your skin.  I do that twice a week.  You can use it as an everyday moisturizer. I personally prefer a thick lotion so this is wonderful. I admit I'm not as thrilled with the light version because of my thicker preference. But that is personal choice.  This lotion will not irritate your skin.  It doesn't have any scent so those with asthma or scent issues will be able to easily use it.  I have tried other brands but this is the best.  Vanicream makes other products too and they are all gentle on skin.	2015-08-01

I chose 4.60, the Dark Intense Auburn. Initially, I liked the original application bottle, and I was impressed at how easily the color and the toner came out of their respective tubes. Product LOOKED smooth and smelled good too. I shook the bottle to blend the ingredients as per instructions, and began applying it. Moments later, as I continued, the hair color itself became sticky, and caused my hair to wad up. Now, I'll admit my hair is long, and it IS an effort to distribute color evenly, but what caused my real concern, is that the base of the applicator bottle is rather round, and dome-like. It slipped out of my gloved hands several times and splattered into the sink. That bottle is very hard to hang onto, because of it's shape, especially when your hands are wet with hair color! I ended up having to rinse my gloves to wash the sink clean several times (and surrounding areas as well) That said, it seemed the color was still making my hair tangled and stiff. I used a small hair brush to blend it into my roots and the ends. (More rinsing & cleaning) I then piled all my hair up, clipped it, and went off to play Candy Crush for 30 minutes......<br />Next: THE SHOWER INCIDENT!!!!!!!!!!1<br />Let's just say, that I closed my eyes, and started rinsing the gore out of my hair. When I opened my eyes, ==== The whole shower floor, walls, curtain, and my body was SPLATTERED in what looked like something from a horror movie!! OMG...OMG.... I applied the conditioner they so thoughtfully provided, and now I see why they advise you to  leave it in for two minutes.  YOU NEED THAT TIME TO WASH AWAY THE EVIDENCE OF A MASSACRE!! It was like a bad episode of Criminal Minds without Shemar Moore in the shower with me! Afterwards, I towel-dried my hair, and let it dry naturally. VERY pretty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &#34;My Bling Strands&#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  ONE THING: NO shine. At all. Not even a little bit. Le Sigh.......tty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &#34;My Bling Strands&#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  ONE THING: NO shine. At all. Not even a little bit.

I spent the first 50 years of my life almost never flossing.  My dentist would lecture me on the importance of flossing, my wife would remind me, but I just couldn't motivate myself.  In addition to just plain floss, I tried various flossing gizmos, but I'd stay at it for a day or two then lose interest.  Then I tried the Reach flosser. I can't explain what's different about it, but while I won't say I enjoy or look forward to flossing, it's become a part of my daily routine just like brushing my teeth. When I've had trouble finding refills, I've tried other flossers, but they're just not the same.  And now that I've found refills on Amazon, I'll be staying with Reach indefinitely.	2015-08-01

I love the Moisturizing Shower gel for travel.  Most places are much drier than Hawaii so my skin dries out when we travel.  This is great to keep moisturized.  I like the Skin So Soft products as insect repellent purposes.  I also carry a small bottle of Skin so Soft moisturizing oil for more protection and moisturizing purposes.  The hook is a great benefit in the showers.  One problem, has been it sometimes leaks due to airplane pressure.  I put a small piece of plastic, like a piece of grocery  bag or &#34;saran&#34; wrap under the cap and seems to solve the problem.  To be sure, I also put it in a zip lock baggie.	2015-08-01

The problem I have is that it isn't the standard size for a disc of shaving soap; I had to shave off edges, soak it in warm water for a long time, and then jam it down into my shaving mug, where it fit so tightly that there wasnt room for water to run into the channels and into the reservoir beneath, which would have prevented pooling of excess water on top of the soap. However, the scent and quality is great	2015-08-01

I would give it 5 stars if none of these problems happen to me.<br /><br />This is absolutely the most expensive toothbrush in my life, so is the maintenance of it. Because I thought this is it, the ultimate toothbrush that will stay with me for years.<br /><br />However it turns out that the head doesn't last 3 months (they are pretty expensive too), maybe around 2 months, and it gives me an annoyingly loud and harsh sound every time I turn it on.<br /><br />Then there's the pain in the ass, after almost 8 months of use, the charger base stops working. I didn't use it very often because I'm travelling a lot from home (I think I only used it for 4 months and it is not plugged in most of the time!!!). I don't know where to get this repaired or replaced... Anyone??<br /><br />As for a toothbrush, it does work a lot better than the others, it looks great too.

Always an original Goldleaf fan, I was curious to try this NEW Thymes Goldleaf Gardenia scent -- it had a  younger sounding blend of scents in the mix such as sandalwood and patchouli as well as lots of feminine florals. Plus the prices are much better than they used to be IMHO. So glad I took a chance...I left the shower feeling pampered and the scent was dreamy and evocative without being overpowering. The lather is light, creamy and moisturizes even my sensitive/newly shaved legs and fair skin without any sticky feeling residue...Just a hint of heavenly fragrance. Will be buying again. Which is better-original Goldleaf or new Goldleaf Gardenia? I'll need more luxurious bath time to decide; you might too :)	2015-08-01

Perhaps the manufacturer and I have different ideas about what a conditioner is supposed to do, but I think it should be restoring oil and texture.

I have been using plain old Neutrogena but thought I could find something better. This product IS NOT it. It comes out of the tube thick & greasy. It did not rub in no matter how long I tried. So I left on my Saturday ride all white & slimey. If you sweat much do not put this stuff anywhere around your eyes, as it stings like the dickens if any sweat runs into your eye. In my case, protection is mediocre. I came home with a pretty good burn. Yes, I know you are supposed to reapply every 80 minutes, but I sure wasn't going to get all slimed up again out on the road. And the Neutrogena seems to last much longer.<br /><br />Save your money, there is better products out there.	2015-08-01

Now I should make it clear that these are not some sort of miracle cure to instantly take weight off your body - unfortunately no such thing exists!  What they do succeed in doing, however, is making the skin feel soft and supple.  The wraps are quite easy to use.  Following the instructions, I started by peeling back the middle section and applying it around my navel.  I could immediately smell the green tea powder which is one of the ingredients in the wrap - what a pleasant and soothing scent!  I then peeled off the ends and continued to press the wrap to my skin.  The wrap itself feels quite soft and is comfortable to wear.  I ended up even keeping mine on overnight - the adhesive stayed on very well and I got a fine night's sleep.  The next morning it was very easy to take off and I could really feel that the skin where the wrap had been was softer and smoother than the skin around it.  As for &#34;slimming&#34;, I'm not so sure there.  There may be a bit of improvement in skin tone, but it's going to take a lot more than an herbal wrap to take off the extra pounds that I have put on since my son was born!<br /><br />I'm very glad that I was able to order this as a free promotional sample in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.	2015-08-01

I was possibly allergic to Biotin. My entire scalp broke out in an itchy rash, with painful postulates all over the scalp. The entire skin started peeling and it was a painful ordeal. I got the shampoo from my local Whole Foods, and tried it for a month before giving up on this shampoo entirely.<br /><br />Typically Biotin is known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H. It is water soluble, and helps the body function better. However, side effects of Biotin can be nasty. As soon as I stopped using the shampoo, the entire scalp cleared up with no more itchiness in a week. You should try the shampoo in a small quantity before buying the large batch.<br /><br />You can review the effects of Biotin more here - http://www.md-health.com/Biotin-Side-Effects.html.	2015-08-01

I have never seen my skin look like I actually have a tan and not colored some kind of unnatural orange color. I do not tan under any circumstances, and this tanner really looks natural! I have had so many compliments about the natural look, I only have to use it once a week and it lasts and looks fresh the whole time. There is no bad smell and it gradually darkens overnight for that perfect color. I will never use any other brand self tanning lotion again!<br />I had to come back and upload a couple photos after I have used it more than once. I use it only twice a week and I am able to maintain a perfectly light golden color that actually looks like it is natural.

Does not work so well on the front hairline, but if your are thinning up near the crown this works great.  I had a big night out with some friends and decided to give this a go.  First I did a test trial before I showered and got ready.  Now, I hadn't washed my hair in a day or two, and when i put this on it blended in pretty great from what i could tell.  I could hardly see any trace of my balding spot.<br /><br />So then I took a shower, washed my hair, and after my hair was completely dry I did my application.  When I tried to blend it in like I had before the shower, a LOT of the fibers came off my hair and it didn't look as good as when I had applied it to my dirty hair.  So I sprayed a bit of hairspray on and put some more on, it blended better but still didn't look as good as when I had 'dirtier' hair.  It now looked like I was in the very early stages of thinning, instead of having a clearly visible balding spot.  Sprayed some more hairspray to try and lock it in and went out for the night.<br /><br />The next morning I woke up, I didn't notice any of the fibers on my pillow.  When I checked myself in the mirror though, my balding spot was showing a lot more than the night before.<br /><br />So I think next time I think I'll grease my hair up a tiny bit with some lotion or something before applying and see if that helps.	2015-08-01

This stuff is the miracle I have been looking for! My scalp gets horrible patches of eczema, and unfortunately it's not something I can afford to go to the doctor for. I have tried every shampoo, every home remedy, every recommendation ever made to me by my best friend's neighbor's grandmother's cousin's dog groomer, and nothing has worked as well as this has! I've only used it 3 times, and the results are nothing short of amazing! The red patches are almost completely gone, no more flakes, and the itching has stopped. I also love that it is a totally natural shampoo, so I have found relief without the use of harmful chemicals! I received this product at a discount for my honest review, but it is definitely something I will be purchasing again!	2015-08-01

If you are new to essential oils, Rosalina is a must try for relaxation and respiratory issues. It's a lot like lavender in the sense that when diffused it promotes relaxation and sleep but unlike lavender, this oil just smells really fresh while I tend to think lavender, while truly fantastic, can feel a bit stuffy.<br /><br />I've also used Rosalina a few times when I had colds or when it felt like I might be developing some sort of respiratory issue and it has always seemed to knock it out.<br /><br />With that said, Plant Therapy is a really high quality essential oil company and they tend to always produce some of the best quality oils around. With that said, Plant Therapy isn't in the business of giving you a lot of low quality oil like a lot of the companies out there. They simply believe quality trumps quantity and they are correct. This Rosalina has a much better scent then a lot of others I have tried and while it might take 7-8 drops of other versions of Rosalina, this version only takes 1-2 drops. So while it might seem like a small bottle, it should last just as long if not longer than a lot of the bigger bottles.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a big fan of Plant Therapy and their Rosalina is a must buy for the essential oil collector.<br /><br />I was provided a discounted product for testing and review. With that said, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone and it will be my go to for Rosalina for the foreseeable future because its just a grade above the rest I have run across.	2015-08-01

I am checking to see if I can return this. This shea butter has the most strong and pungent odor that is quite nauseating. I tried making some natural deodorant with it and the smell is so strong that even after 40 drops of essential oils, all you could smell was the shea. I only used 3 TBS in the recipe. I expected some earthy scent, but this was so bad. It doesn't smell right at all. I don't know if this is how shea is suppose to smell, but I can't imagine using it in any natural recipes. This is definitely getting returned. Awful!  ***update*** I tried emailing customer service and have never received any response. I waited to return to amazon because the company offered to replace it because it may have been a bad batch. After FOUR emails, I haven't heard anything back. The company commented saying my email wasn't working. I have been receiving emails without issues.  I told them I'd email again so that we could work something out. It's only been crickets and now it's too late to return to Amazon. I am so frustrated! Buyer beware.	2015-08-01

In efforts to find a more natural haircare solution I have tried no poo with baking soda with apple cider vinegar, hair soap shampoo bars, etc.  I just missed that shampoo and conditioner experience.<br /><br />So I checked environmental working group, and found this company to rank very well with them.  I bought the shampoo and conditioner and have been using both for over a year now.  Honestly, I don't think I've ever used the same hair washing routine for this long.<br /><br />I have lots of thin, curly hair.  As far as haircare goes, it's pretty easy to please, all the aforementioned methods worked just fine.  I'm not looking to bring back the 80s, but pairing this with Andalou naturals hairspray gets millennium appropriate volume.<br /><br />I hope this will be around for a long time - it's got a great ingredient list and it works.  A win for me!	2015-08-01

It's a great shampoo, conditioner, and hair treatment. My hair has suffered from being in the sun, chlorine in the pool, and frequent weather change but after I used these products, my hair feels moisturized and healthy again-even though it doesn't get rid of the damage 100%, at least it works. The price you get for all 3 is a great deal as well. It did leave a perfume scent in my hair while making it soft.<br /><br />I used the shampoo when my hair was wet, rinsed and then left the treatment in my hair for about 2 minutes. You'll notice the difference right away, the hair feels softer, smoother, and less tangled. You don't always have to use conditioner after you use the treatment because the treatment works like a conditioner if you know what I mean.<br />Overall, I absolutely love this product and would purchase it again in a different scent.	2015-08-01

Despite some of the other reviews, I have found every tool to be of use. The quality and ergonomics are decent, and nothing has broken in the 8 months I have been using it. My biggest reason for a five-star rating is the battery life. In the last 8 months, I have charged it ONLY THREE TIMES.<br /><br />As for maintenance, hairs do find their way into the interior of each head, but they are easy enough to remove for the most part. Due to the brushing out of the hair, the grease on the heads tends to diminish. If you're an avid cyclist or auto enthusiast, simply dab a bit of silicone grease onto a toothpick and into the mechanism, and all is well.	2015-08-01

I used it with the Joico light purple to create an ombre effect, which looked great at first, but light purple is a cooler hue than amethyst, so my hair now fades from magenta to lavender. The color has held up well with minimal bleeding on my bleached hair and is a great choice to cover hair that's only been bleached to orange instead of yellow. I'm going to try indigo next, as I think it will complement the light purple better.	2015-08-01

I was hopeful about this product but am reticent to try unknown products in or near my eyes. It says it can be used to enhance eyebrow growth as well, so I thought I would start there and see how I reacted to it. It has only been a few applications, the solution is clear and brushes onto eyebrows easily with a very fine brush. It is not runny so I can see it staying along an eyelash line well without dripping after you get the hang of it. It does burn slightly as it is applied, but it was minor and there was no visible irritation- not enough to run to the bathroom to wipe it all off. Maybe the tingle means it is working? The slight irritation is why I gave it three stars, but I will update this review if I adjust to the irritation and receive positive results. It is marketed as a prescription free alternative to enhance lash growth and encloses specific instructions on directions and usage, also stating it is paraben and fragrance free, free of harsh dyes, and safe for contact lens wearers. As it has not been 30 days I won't comment on it's performance quite yet, but if after continued application I notice a difference on my eyebrows, one way or another, I'll update this review and add details- I want to know if a product is safe near my eyes first, and enhances my lashes or brows thereafter!	2015-08-01

I've just started peeling, but it is living up to my expectations. I'll post more once I'm finished!  8/10/2015 My peeling is complete, and I have the softest, smoothest feet-probably more so than since I was a child. I've always preferred bare feet to shoes, and I guess I've paid for that with thick skin and not so soft feet. Now I really have to wear flip flops, at least, whenever I go out, because my feet have never been this sensitive, but the lovely, soft skin is worth it~ Highly recommend!!   An added bonus, if you have smelly feet, I am certain this will help. I usually can't smell my feet, unless I've been in hiking boots, or something for a while. The first skin that peeled off took any odor away. I just have to try to get my husband to use this great product!	2015-08-01

This was my first time trying a lemon, black-pepper and sandalwood blend and now I'm not entirely sure how I have gone this long without it! Such a wonderful scent.<br /><br />I've been using it first thing in the morning in my diffuser and I've been taking the bottle with me to work to smell whenever I feel my energy lagging. It really seems to help perk me up especially first thing in the morning. I open my eyes and turn on the diffuser and close my eyes. While normally this would lead to me falling back asleep, within a few minutes I just feel ready to go.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Plant Therapy because they provide some of the strongest oils I have ever come across. While some people would rather give you a 2oz bottle of low scent oil, plant therapy would rather give you the strongest oil they can and let you determine if you want to dilute it. And since its so strong it will last just as long if not longer than those bigger bottles so its a win win!<br /><br />I managed to snag a discount because they are currently switching their packaging and labeling so they have to deplete the old stock but even at the full price I totally recommend it and I plan to buy more once I run out because its just fantastic!	2015-08-01

Be sure that you use gloves when you apply (you don't want your palms turning colors, etc) and apply to larger areas of the body first and then use the slight excess over the knees, elbows, etc. I didn't have any issues with streaks or with it turning &#34;orange&#34; and I have a medium-beige skin tone. The product lasts at least a week, without multiple applications, however, I recommend re-applying a few times a week if you want your skin to become darker or twice per week if you want to keep the same tone. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions and thoughts are 100% my own. Highly Recommended!	2015-08-01

BareMinerals is the only product line I've found that decently matches, but the concealer didn't have the staying power.  This NYX concealer (in DCC03-medium) does a great job of covering dark undereye circles while blending into my skin (w/o additional makeup), staying on (given my oily eyelids, and southern heat/humidity), AND its inexpensive.  Overall a great buy- hope it is not discontinued.	2015-08-01

Brushing my teeth can seem like a pain, despite being a very important health routine, and I was even more skeptical about my free sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™when I saw it was a two step process. Really? Another step to add into my morning routine??? Wrong.  The entire process took literally two minutes and really impressed me after my first use.  Not only did I notice my breath felt fresh and my mouth had an overall cleaner feel, but I could tell my teeth were truly whiter after one application. The best part of my experience so far with Crest Pro Health® HD™? The comments I've been receiving from my friends and family.  They are noticing my teeth are whiter and are begging me to let them in on the secret.  Of course I've let them in, and we all agree that we will never again buy a leading brand toothpaste that claims to &#34;whiten&#34; and &#34;freshen&#34; because they simply do not hold up to their promise like Crest Pro Health® HD™!	2015-08-01

I have red/head auburn coloring. I'm not pale and freckled like a lot of red heads. I'm a little darker, but still have the same pink undertones. This looks great on! You can easily pull off a light natural look or a heavier darker smokey look with the mix of colors. As with all eye makeup palettes I've ever used, there are some colors that I use ALWAYS and some I've never touched. So not all of the colors are useful for me. But it's nice having so many shades to choose from to create different looks. I haven't used the applicator, I use my own makeup brushes. The colors are easy to build up into darker heavier shades. I haven't had any creasing either.	2015-08-01

I have very fine, curly hair and this product defines my curls and makes my hair shine. I've spent a lot of money trying to get my curly hair to shine. This is the only thing I've ever tried that does it.<br /><br />After using this product one morning, I passed my stylist on sidewalk on the way in to the salon. I was going in for eyelash tinting. She'd just cut my hair the day before. She stopped short and asked me what I'd done to my hair. She thought I'd used a curling wand and styled it. I had just air-dried. After seeing how great my hair looked, she told me I should use it after every shampoo, which is not what the directions say, but I took her advice. I love this product. I've just set up a recurring order so I never run out.	2015-08-01

I was even able to shave (pun intended) about 5 mins off my morning routine and that's a welcome change. I'll have to update this after using it for awhile as I see how this new RQ12+ compares to the old RQ12 over time, but from my first experience, it's a winner so far.

This is the best brow powder I have ever used. I had Brooke Shields brows when I was young and they have thinned out with age but still look pretty good. I have used many, many brands and this is the best. I put the wax on first then the colors then I comb a clear coat on top. I have an amazing eyebrow brush from Hakuhodo that is my favorite. It is wider and longer then average brushes. I use the dark ash blonde though I have medium brown hair. It looks more natural on me then the darker shades(they can look harsh at times especially on us forty something's). I am going to buy another as the price is fantastic and my 13 year took off with the one I had. Love this brand!	2015-08-01

I think the problem is the &#34;hold&#34; is broken very easily. It works great at first, and smells nice, but even on pretty short/medium hair it doesn't hold up to wind or touching. I'm not even wanting &#34;cemented into place,&#34; just retaining basic shape. I think this might be best for those comfortable using a lot of gel; I don't find it works for the natural look very well. It actually looks good, just not natural. It also smells very nice.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm not a huge fan of the gel but the Triple Thread anti-frizz cream is the best I've ever used.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

I've been looking for a new affordable scent and thought I'd start wearing this again. I have to admit that I don't like it. It smells like bargain brand soap to me. For some reason in my memory it smelled like coconuts or sunscreen. I will say that it is a light scent, in my opinion. I don't mind smelling like soap, but I would prefer it to be from the shower as opposed to from a bottle.	2015-08-01

Beauty	1	7	8	N	N	Ain't Nothing Organic About this lotion...Dangerous to your health	I'm sick and tired of cosmetic companies trying to to fool people into thinking their products are natural and organic with their misleading labels. I bought three bottle of this stuff only to find it isn't any better than a moisturizer you might find at CVS or Walgreens. This product may have naturally derived ingredients like &#34;Argan Oil,&#34; but that's only to make up for the fact that it's packed with cosmetic chemicals. It also doesn't state what &#34;fragrance&#34; is? Which is always suspicious because people don't know what they are putting in their bodies. The biggest offender in the ingredients list is Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate.  Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate is an ingredient used in foundation, skin moisturizers, lipsticks, eye shadows, concealers, sunscreens and facial powders as an anti-caking and viscosity increasing agent, according to the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database. It is a chemical that is toxic to the human nervous system and is a suspected developmental neurotoxin. The aluminum compounds are also suspected respiratory hazards.	2015-08-01

Decided to try something new since I was tired of carving up my face with the safety razor. Been using Taylor's sandlewood shaving cream for years so I figured this would be a natural addition. I was not dissapointed. I've used it for a week now and haven't had razor burn and he nicks and cuts I thought were part of the daily shave are gone.<br /><br />The oil is very viscous and although you don't feel it on your face, you do in your hand. A little bit actually goes a long way. Nice side effect: if using a hand towel to dry your razor between strokes or your hands after applying this, the towel has a great scent for days.	2015-08-01

This is the first Tim I've used gel eyeliner in a little pot like this and also the first time over used brown. I typically use black eye liner that is liquid or in a stick form. This was so easy to use. Went on very smooth and dried in a good amount of time. Worth every penny in my opinion. The little jar is a great size too. U can really get a grasp on it and control the brush at the same time. Some cosmetics are very glossy on the outside and I have dropped them while in use. This isn't glossy on the outside but very attractive looking product none the less.	2015-08-01

Having received my first bottle of Argan Oil, I decided to stop the Clinique products and used only (one drop of) the Argan before bedtime and pre-makeup routine. In the morning, I wake up with a bright, soft, supple face, and application before makeup gives me the dewey look - not the oily kind, just nice and fresh-looking (and I'd like to reiterate again that I only use one drop from the pump for the entire face - not sure what happens if you put more, maybe, maybe it will make you look oily). My point is, it has the same exact effects as the more costly Clinique products I've been using, in fact, only better, because it is organic, and not synthetically-made, not to mention that the Clinique products did not give me that dewey, healthy glow. I especially appreciate the convenience of having to use only one product for both night cream and daily moisturizer than the list of products I mentioned above. It's really that good that even my non-metrosexual (read: typical guy, with non-elaborate skin-care routine) husband has joined in the bandwagon and noticing significant difference with his skin.<br /><br />As a minor comment for improvement, it would be nice if Pura d'or can revise the information pamphlet that comes with the packaging for a more professional and convincing look and feel because the written description (in English) that came in mine was hanging, &#34;Pura d'or argan oil aids in building firmer skin, while restor- &#34; - well, some people do read the fine print and benefit from the little details provided :)<br /><br />Otherwise, all else is really neat about this product. It is also available in the 2oz/100ml option which makes it easier to bring along as a carry-on luggage during air travel. Definitely will repurchase and highly recommend to those who are seeking natural alternatives and support businesses that are mindful to mother Earth i.e. the company uses unbleached recycled paper for the pamphlets and printing ink used was produced from a sustainable process, the fabric pouched included in the packaging made from natural fibers is reusable, disposable, biodegradable etc., just perfect for the environmentally conscientious.estor- &#34; - well, some people do read the fine print and benefit from the little details provided :)<br /><br />Otherwise, all else is really neat about this product.

Includes Organic Lavender, Clary Sage & Roman Chamomile, Organic Jojoba + Sunflower Oil	Beauty	5	29	29	N	N	A perfect mix of ready to use mix of essential oils for relaxation	I was so excited to get this de-stress pure essential oil blend in the mail. It comes in a beautiful blue glass bottle that was packaged well so it arrived safely. The colored bottle helps the oils stay fresher for longer. You won’t need a dropper since the design of the opening allows for a drop or two of oil to release when you tilt it over. The cap screws on well and I haven’t had any problems with it leaking. It’s a well thought out design.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I get stressed out from time to time. When it builds up it’s hard for me to let go and wind down. This is my first experience with essential oils so I was thrilled to find a combination of oils specifically chosen to relieve stress. Since it already has jojoba oil and sunflower oil as carrier oils there is no need to mix anything. It’s ready to use right away.<br /><br />The mix of oils smells wonderful. You can open up the oil and smell it for a calming boost, but my favorite way to use it is to rub it on my skin. Even though it doesn’t need a carrier oil, I like adding a few drops to a bit of sweet almond oil and rubbing it on the bottom of my feet before going to bed. I’ve slept really well since I started doing this. It really is the perfect mix of essential oils to help the stress go away.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are entirely my own and not influenced in any way.	2015-08-01

I was very fortunate to get to try this two step whitening product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I had my doubts about trying yet another tooth whitener, but this one has really won me over. I'm a coffee, tea and soda drinker. Most whitening toothpastes don't give me the results I want, and bleaching gels make my teeth so sensitive that I have to stop using them before they even have a chance to work. I tried professional whitening, which not only stung like crazy but also gave disappointing results. So needless to say, I didn't expect to fall in love with this either. However, the Crest 3D White Brilliance toothpaste and whitening gel combo really worked!  In one week my teeth where shades lighter, and they just kept getting lighter, brighter, and whiter every time I brushed. I've been using the two step system for several weeks now and my teeth are whiter than they've ever been!  And the best part is, I've had absolutely no pain or sensitivity from it whatsoever!  I can't rave about this product enough. I am just floored by the results!  By the way, even though you are brushing your teeth in two steps instead of one, it really doesn't take more than a few extra seconds because each step takes one minute of brushing, and the general rule of thumb is to brush for two minutes anyway. Thank you, Crest, for a great product.	2015-08-01

Beauty	5	2	3	N	N	Helps with dark under eye circles	Like the gold eye masks that I purchased from the same company I put these in the fridge so that they would be nice and cold prior to putting on my face.  They are slippery so I suggest that you are careful when applying to your face so that you don't get any of the liquid in your eyes.  I also found that it was easier to apply them and to lay down so that they will stay in place.  I'm not sure about walking around with them on as I found that they slipped off if you are moving around too much.  The darkness under my eyes seems to have improved after I've used them for a while.  I typically will put them on at night and leave them on for about 45 minutes.

First off it's expensive and I'm not even sure if it actually works. I looks like water and as almost no smell. It comes with 32oz and I have used the whole bottle on about 4 loads of laundry seeing as it takes about 3 caps full to do a load. Personally I won't but it again as all my clothes are still in the same condition and have the same smell. Even the deodorant that was in the armpits of my shirts still had the scent. I'm not sure this is a good product at all. It looks like it came from the dollar store one of my friends noticed it on my washed and was like you shouldn't use cheap stuff. So yeah not sure it it actually worked but I gave it a shot.	2015-08-01

I have had this product and have taken it many times. It works very well to keep me regular. This morning I just happened to noticed the bottle says Menstrual Reg. I was like what in the world!!??!!  They look exactly like the LBS II bottles, so it gave me no reason to inspect them. And the crazy thing is the way they were packaged when they came, the side I saw, was LBS II. I was sent 2 of each, which is NOT what I was supposed to get. Now it makes sense why I haven't been regular and why the little 9 year old girl I gave one to never went. Grrr.....this is ridiculous. I understand issues can happen, but a little irritated I never caught this until now. I'm also having issues with my period lasting longer than it should and having to call my OBGYN to schedule an appointment to see what's going on. Hope this isn't the reason why I am irregular this month. Never had this issue before.	2015-08-01

I purchased this hairclip for my wife who has incredibly thick, wavy hair. It's a few inches past her shoulders and she always has it up in an elastic band. I bought her some of the usual &#34;claw&#34; clips and she wore them until one day we were in the car and I hit the brakes really hard. She said when I hit the brakes, her head hit the head rest, and the &#34;teeth&#34; on the clip dug into the back of her head a bit and hurt. Back to the elastic bands. I found this and thought it would be perfect. And it was! She can lay in bed flat on her back with it and it won't hurt the back of her head. It won't evenly hold up all of her hair, but it holds up most. She says she loves the way it looks as well. Unfortunately I only gave this hair clip a 3 out of 5 because 5 days after she got it one of the claws broke off. The claws are made way too thin and do not stand up against very thick hair. They are also really sharp. Back to the elastic bands.	2015-08-01

When I put this serum on, then put another serum + oil on top of it, my face felt really warm, but I thought it might be in my imagination. But after another couple minutes, I decided to look in the mirror. My face had turned dark beet red like a 1st degree sunburn. I quickly washed off my face, but the redness was a true burn and stayed. I slapped a thick layer of hydrocortisone cream on my face, then took a Benadryl, then thankfully it was mostly healed by morning. But be careful. I tested the other items I used with it separately, but they weren't the burn trigger; this one was.	2015-08-01

The following review is provided by both my wife AND myself. Trust me, at this point in my life I have no further &#34;beauty issues&#34;....It is also a short but sweet review for ME anyway as this is a very limited use device in my opinion. And my wife and I both come at this review from a somewhat unorthodox and different perspective. Scar Tissue. OK, this is for beauty & &#34;rejuvenation&#34;. Say what you will but essentially we all will find our own particular use for it. The review below is addressing the common purpose this was designed for but also from the standpoint of use from Cancer survivors....It is too soon to know if any benefit will be gained for THAT purpose but will update as time passes. This was the preface to the review. Now from my wife who has very large scars on her face, forehead up through the upper scalp area. HER &#34;scar tissue&#34; is mostly referring to a physical scar, one you SEE on the skin when looking at it it. This is the predominate area that she address it for her scar tissue. She LOVES use of it all over her remaining facial area from the standpoint it makes her feel so relaxed and pampered. You know, that ICKY Girlie stuff...HER words below:<br /><br />5 stars<br />This massager is great, my face feels so soft and relaxed. It requires 2 AA batteries and works fine with rechargeable's. The directions are very easy to follow as to what head to use for each treatment including picture of head to match with directions. It felt wonderful to use and made my skin feel so soft and clean. In particular, I'm working to smooth out scar tissue on my forehead and it seems to be working. Great product and I look forward to each use of it. The brushes are amazingly soft and enjoyable to use.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />MY words below:<br />5 stars<br />I have had several HUNDRED staples removed from my throat, my entire spine and in both vertical and horizontal directions. I look very much like many of the jigsaw puzzles reviewed by my fellow reviewer Joseph Dewey reviews (check his review of this very item here as well- he does a GREAT demonstration!) that has gotten my wife hooked on jigsaw puzzles:-) I don't need to be beautiful, too late! But I am trying very much to survive the many surgeries I just completed with more on the horizons if I can regain enough strength to survive those surgeries. At this point, I am too weak after 6 spinal fusions and a Mastectomy in just 5 months (yes I AM male but it happens to us too) and the loss of 60 pounds of muscle....<br /><br />Now the scar tissue I want to work on is across my entire back and up my entire back. In MY case, not to try to eliminate the physical scar you see, NOTHING will or could ever erase the deep scars I have. But MY scar tissue is one 2 plastic surgeons have even helped remove for me surgically by opening me up and literally grinding them out. If you run your fingers across my back, anywhere over several FEET of visible scars you will feel jagged, reef like material. THAT is my scar tissue (very long story, no point in telling it here). The problem with my scar tissue its it feels like a serrated knife trying to SAW its way OUT of my back through my skin. THIS is what I want to use this item for. I am attempting to break down this tissue to be absorbed within my body for pain relief. Between using assorted pain rubs bought here at Amazon, along with this, I hope to little by little &#34;possibly&#34; break down some of this massive amount of internal scar tissue. Too soon for me to know if I will achieve any measure of success. Time will tell. So for me, the only item on this (by item I mean the attachment) I use is the &#34;Rolling massager: To make better blood circumstances from skin aging&#34; as it is described with poor Chinese translation in the included manual.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />End of MY partof the review. This item for only around $10.00 delivered at the time of my review is so well worth the investment. If it succeeds or not at reducing MY type of internal scar tissue, or my wife's external type scar tissue is really not of huge importance. It is a device that offers ME a degree of hope, it makes my wife feel pampered. An SHE IS BEAUTIFUL so I'd like to see her stay that way. For all that women have to endure in there day to day lives under the best of circumstances, I love to find a product like this that can give them at least a few minutes of 'ME&#34; time. Time to take a breath, relax, feel pampered. For just a few dollars? How can you not try this?of the review.

Nothing gets my face smoother than st Ives apricot scrub. I use it every other day to keep my face nice and smooth. It smells great and doesn't burn my face.

It stops sweating under your arms, flat out stops it. That means it also stops any odor you might not want as a side effect of sweating. I used it when I was exercising and found that it kept my underarms dry but did not prevent my body from cooling off efficiently by other mean... let's be blunt, your underarms are not the only body parts to sweat so this will only solve part of any sweat and odor problem you may have.<br /><br />This is not a problem to use with your nicer clothing or any clothing you do not want to risk getting white marks on. This is not a go on clear solid at all. It didn't damage any of my clothing but it did mark up some tank tops. At least the marks came out in the wash, right? I didn't notice any particular scent in this product, which I liked, but if you want a powder soft scent, this isn't the best choice. You can find this product in a lot of places so give it a try before you buy a large number of them.	2015-08-01

I really expected it to be bigger than it is. Another 50% of it's actual size added to it would do this product a ton of justice. It just feels to small to me. All-in-all, a good product.	2015-08-01

At 31, I still suffer from the occasional break out and hyper-pigmentation of old acne. I used most of the container, once or twice a day, and didnt experience anything magical. It did not clear my acne and I did not notice any difference in hyper-pigmentation. It dried my skin out a little bit, and maybe helped active acne heal a little bit faster, but not enough for me to want to buy this product again. I had high hopes for you, magic pads! I'm disappointed.<br /><br /> Even worse, I pulled it out to use it after storing it under the sink in my bathroom for a couple weeks, ( there were about 4 or 5 pads left) and now there is funky colored mold on it! It looks like a science project instead of a facial cleansing product.  I can't even finish the container! definitely not buying this again!	2015-08-01

I got a great discount for the Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil n exchange for a review. I found the oil to be lighter than I had expected. My skin was very dry so I tested it there first. I found Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil to absorb fairly quickly and it kept looking like it was moisturized for quite a while. Then I tried it on my grand daughter’s hair.  She has ethnic hair and it looks dry and brittle if it isn’t treated after her shower. I added Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil right to her conditioner and when she used it her hair looked shiny and well conditioned. I love that Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil has no fillers or additives and it has Omega 6 and 9 beneficial fatty acids as well as Vitamin E, minerals, and proteins that are healthy for my hair and skin. And it’s backed by a 100% money back guarantee.	2015-08-01

It feels great when you apply it, like it is refreshing the skin around your eyes.<br />This cream is intended to treat dark circles, puffiness, fine fines and wrinkles. I had been using this cream morning and night for about a week, when I woke up one morning, looked in the mirror, and was surprised by how bright my eyes looked. There were no bags or darkness under my eyes. It is rare to find a product that works in such a short amount of time. This beauty blogger was a bit impressed.

I have gone back to this product every time.<br />It got 4 stars only because when I wear heavy makeup (which is rare), I have to apply it twice to get all the make up off. It does not dry my skin as much as most products. When I was younger I had combination skin with oil in the T zone.

This two-sided bathing implement is really quite useful. One side is the same material as those poofs that are sold everywhere in varying colors and the other is a mild loofah-like surface. Each side has the appearance of the material that inspired it, but is different from the original.<br /><br />The poof-like side is a bit more solid than the poofs. It holds just as much suds but is more substantial in texture. While not being abrasive it is also less soft. The loofah-like side is less abrasive than an actual loofah but has more substance than the poof-side or a towel.<br /><br />The single best attribute of the implement is the design. It has a rounded triangle shape that is easy to grip when using either side. It is encased in a soft rubber holder that has multiple drainage holes (especially along the bottom) to ensure that it drains well and prevent the growth of mold from retained humidity, and it has a string that makes it easy to hang to dry between uses.<br /><br />The one thing I'm not crazy about is the color. The poof side is a blue-gray color that has the look of having been blue at one time and is now old and faded. I guess this is Dove's idea of a macho color but I would have preferred that they went either in the direction of gray or of blue rather than this in-between. How is that for nit picking?	2015-08-01

This is the best value sunblock (uses titanium dioxide/zinc oxide rather than chemical sunscreens) I have found.  As far as I can tell, the ingredients are generally safe.  Advantages to sunblocks such as these:<br />-Superior for sensitive skin as they aren't absorbed rather stay on the surface and physically reflect the UV away from the skin (most sun products available are chemicals that absorb into the skin and change the UV to heat).<br />-Stays on much better even when wet (though you should still reapply as directed).<br />-Begins working immediately since it doesn't need to absorb into the skin first.<br /><br />Disadvantages:<br />-Takes longer to apply and more difficult to rub into skin so it's not visible<br />-More difficult to remove (you may have to use soap and scrub a little)<br />-If you become wet it may be slightly visible giving you a white/pink appearance<br />-More expensive than chemical sunscreens<br />-Applying when you're already wet or sweaty will make you look like a melting white mess<br /><br />Tips-<br />-For easier application apply before sweating<br />-Scrub facial hair with a towel after application to remove white residue<br />-Lightly &#34;buff&#34; with a towel after application to remove excess and minimize the &#34;white look&#34;<br />-The Banana Boat Kids, Baby, and standard sunblock have the same active ingredients in the same concentration and the inactive ones are in the same order, suggesting the products are all the same just different packaging/marketing.  Buy whichever is cheapest they are all safe for use on babies 6 months or older (younger if advised by a doctor)	2015-08-01

I started my EO journey a little over 3 months ago. After attending a disappointing presentation by a rep from an mlm company. It spurred me on to do my own research. I came across Plant Therapy (PT) and choose it as my go to company for essential oils. I made this choice because they espouse safe usage (have hired one of the go to people on using EOs safety as a consultant who also developed their &#34;kids safe&#34; line), have trained aromatherapists on staff to answer questions, support a fabulous FB page on safe usage, etc. PT really thinks of the little touches, the bottles have labels on the top with the names of the oils/synergies. Trust me, it really makes it easier to find what you want/need as your collection grows.  Open the bottle and it smells like a Christmas tree--that fresh, clean, sharp smell. There's nothing fake about it. Pine is most commonly known for its ability to help with symptoms caused from an illness. Inhale it to help ease congestion. When properly diluted in a carrier oil, you can apply to affected area to help reduce pain caused from arthritis, joint and muscle pain and rheumatism.  My other thought is to use it in the shower like a vaporizer when you're congested.  You can put a few drops on the shower floor, or make shower discs--a baking soda, cornstarch and water mixture that hardens by baking at a low temperature in silicone mold. You put them in the shower with a few drops of EOs and they add to the steam. Just do a web search to find a recipe. Very easy. Just make sure they dry through, or they'll break.  I received this product at a discount for an honest review because PT is in process of changing all of it's labels. While they do have the child safe line, they are now going to indicate which other individual oils and synergies are child safe. I checked and this oil is child safe.	2015-08-01

Very very sad as I did not receive the 1st pair at a &#34;discounted price&#34;etc yet loved them, thus left a highly favorable review to let others know. Sigh.......Once again, looking for the perfect tweezers.	2015-08-01

This vessel is beneficial in many ways:  When used with essential oils, the aroma can be wonderful and can soothe your soul, stimulate your mind or sex drive, or bring back memories.  A fine mist of certain oils dispersed through the air is healthful and can help keep germs at bay.  Certain oils can calm you and other oils can keep insects away.  Just the investigation of the vast variety of essential oils can spur you on to a new hobby.  Or maybe:  This vessel in combination with a few small bottles of oils can be a great gift--bringing a new hobby to someone that needs one.<br /><br />I love the colorful LEDs found on most vessels like these.  So, WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT to find out that the only color on this vessel is the single periwinkle blue/violet color LED....Seriously?  YES!  So, no choice of colors.  On other vessels, this blue/violet color is a choice, but there are also a rainbow of other colors to choose, too.<br /><br />NOTE:  In one section of the User Manual we are advised to add 1-2 drops of essential oil to the vessel after water has been added.  In another section, I see it says &#34;12 drops&#34;.  May I suggest that you do NOT use 12 drops?  More than a few drops, and you will find that if you let the water evaporate in the bottom of the tank, you will have to deal with a very, very sticky residue.  Don't use too much oil each time, and definitely wipe it out of the tank while there is still a bit of liquid in the bottom.  This vessel has a tank that canNOT be removed and washed separately away from the electronics.  It is a fault of most aromatherapy vessels and a situation that one has to deal with.  From experience, let me just say that it is fairly easy to clean the tank when it is still got a bit of liquid in it (with the oil sitting on top of the water).  It is hard to clean a tank where the oils are glued to the plastic bottom of a tank that you cannot totally immerse in soapy water.<br /><br />Also the User Manual has the buttons backwards:  Single blue/violet color or no color is on the left side of the one oval button.  Mist button is on the right; there is a high and low mist.<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Oak Leaf.s:  Single blue/violet color or no color is on the left side of the one oval button.  Mist button is on the right; there is a high and low mist.<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Oak Leaf.	2015-08-01

I picked these up based on reviews in a makeup group I belong to. I am always on the hunt for good brushes but can't get over the sticker shock of $50 each at Ulta/Sephora. These honestly feel just as soft as the brushes I've felt there. I'm sure they won't hold up as long as the brand name brushes but I can buy 4 sets of these for the price of one brush there. They seem well put together, there were no loose hairs. They also came with a description of each brush and how to use it. They are well balanced and I LOVE the case they come in. It's really cute and perfect for rolling up when you travel! I would definitely recommend these brushes.<br /><br />My one complaint is the toxic smell when you first open them up however they arrived while I was home on my lunch break so I left them open on the counter and by the time I returned home that night I couldn't smell a thing.	2015-08-01

My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong fragrances.<br /><br />I replaced deodorant with a crystal body deodorant stick which works for me. It's easy to use and goes on clear. Simply wet the crystal under running water for just a tad and roll it under armpit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No fragrance.<br />Goes on clear.<br />Really does control odor.<br />Does not contain parabens or aluminum.<br />Does not stain clothes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you have a tendency to perspire heavily, this product won't work for you.<br />If you have a tendency towards developing strong body odors this product may not work for you.<br />If you drop the crystal it will separate from the base and you will struggle to use it.<br />This particular size stick doesn't travel well. I need to find a smaller one for my travels.<br /><br />Will I use this product again? Yes this will continue to be my product of choice.<br /><br />Who should use this product? This product works for people who do not perspire heavily and who are seeking alternatives to deodorant.	2015-08-01

The only complaint so far is that it doesn't have any instructions in the box other than how to load your blade, but they do have tips and tricks on their website. I would suggest this as a great choice for anyone getting started with safety razors.	2015-08-01

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Clove = healthy mouth, pain reliever, home-scenter	I am a collector of essential oils to add to my medicine cabinet. :) I really love Plant Therapy because they sell quality oils at prices we all can afford. Currently, I have gotten several oils to help with muscle cramping and I cannot wait to use the organic clove bud. It is nice to know that the oil is pure, since it is organic, and I appreciate that the specific name is also listed on the bottle. I love the strong smell of clove oil, but I some may not. It reminds me of Christmas, and I will also be using it in an essential oil diffuser to scent my home around the holidays. Some essential oils are steam distilled for the best fragrance, and this is one of them. I love that it wasn't distilled with harmful solvents! Clove can also be used for toothaches, and has been known to kill off the 'bad bugs' in the mouth. I will likely also be creating a clove and peppermint mouthwash for a super clean mouth, but not using the generic mouthwashes full of a laundry list of not-so-great ingredients!<br /><br />If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &#34;helpful&#34; or leave a comment.

She looked like she had some sort of mange, ringworm, flea bite combo on her tummy and her skin was so itchy and patchy, that she'd flinch if you touched her. I googled ”patchy itchy dog” or something along those lines and Keys products came up. I buy everything on Amazon, so I searched here and bought 3 different Keys lotions and the soap. They smell VERY natural. Like hippies run wild. I like it - my husband does not. TOO BAD, HUSBAND! Because the Keys spray bottle product has worked liked freaking gangbusters on Lou! I've sprayed her patches every night for a week, and her skin is about 90% healed. Considering I've been trying to help her for a month, this seems like a straight up miracle. Lou is in a great mood and feeling so much better, she's running around and being playful with the other dogs even though she usually acts superior to them.	2015-08-01

They weren't zits either	A few months ago I noticed some little skin color bumps on my temples. They were very little and not very visible. But you could feel them. They made my skin feel like sandpaper. They weren't zits either. Upon inspection they were just bumps with nothing in them. So I figured if I left them alone and took care of my skin as usual they'd go away. Nope. They started spreading down my jawline and onto my cheeks. They were still super small and skin colored and you couldn't see them unless the light hit me at the right direction. But I was starting to get really self conscious. The whole lower portion of my face was sooo rough. So I started trying to just take better care of myself. I exercise and eat healthy anyway, but I started upping my game and taking really good care of myself. I added in a few supplements that were recommended, like fish oil. I made sure I was guzzling water. I went makeup free. I made sure not to touch my face. But, after having the bumps for at least four months, my skin erupted in a matter of days to full blown adult acne with deep painful cysts. It was so red and inflamed that a friend was convinced I had fallen and gouged my face on the ground. She wouldn't believe that it was just acne because the day before when she'd seen me it wasn't there. So I started looking for a product to help since just trying to be healthier wasn't cutting it. Since then I've tried LOTS of soaps and masks and scrubs and acid peels and DIY cures. Some things don't work at all. Some things seem like they are working only to stop. This is the first product I've used that is actually getting it under control. After only two days my skin was much less red and inflamed. It still has A LONG way to go to be cured. But it's getting there slowly. I forgot to take this with me when I went to visit family for two days and in those two days my skin erupted again. Never again will I forget this stuff!<br />The cream does make your skin VERY DRY and flaky. Be very very careful not to get it anywhere that doesn't need it. I accidentally got it a little too low on my jaw line and it took days to get that healthy skin moisturized again. I was surprised at just how dry it made my healthy skin in one application! I also got it too close to my eyes one night because the bumps on my temples are close to that area. Ouch! Be as precise as possible when you're applying. Also I read that most people apply this and let it sit for 15-20 min before applying a moisturizer. I found that applying the moisturizer spread this stuff around to place I didn't want, no matter how long I let it sit and soak in. So I started applying the moisturizer first then the cream. It does help cut down on the drying, plus it doesn't spread it around where you don't want it. It might not be as effective, but for me it's working much better. My skin is still improving when I do moisturizer first (lots of it!) then apply the benzoyl peroxide cream. I still have days where I look like a lizard shedding it's skin (which can look even worse under makeup), but it's much better than angry painful clusters of cysts.<br />I've had to experiment, but a good face scrub helps the skin shed quicker so it's not quite as flaky. I've been using one from Mario Badescu that doesn't clog my pores or aggravate my sensitive inflamed face. Just be gentle with any scrub! And don't use it too much, no matter how tempting!<br />I'm not sure if the pills would help without the cream. I haven't tried one without the other. Obviously I can see the difference the cream is making because it is so drying. But I don't know if the pills would work on their own or not. Since I'm having so much luck with them together I don't really want to risk experimenting. But if the cream is too harsh and makes it worse I'd say it's definitely worth trying just the pills! I mean, compare the price of this to a derm visit and it can't hurt to at least try!not to get it anywhere that doesn't need it.

I have medium size hands, and found it fit nicely while not overwhelming in size. I felt the stone size is perfect, any larger would scream fake. Its a beautiful little ring, that is flexible. I separated the band a bit to allow the stones to have more negative space between them in the bypass arrangement. But you can easily bend band so they touch if thats your preferred look. Item arrived about three weeks faster then estimated, nice surprise :)  I am not sure how long the metal plating will hold up, but this is purchased as a decorative ring for occasional wear.  It is very low cost, so I would not expect it to work well as a daily wear ring.  The stones have a good amount of sparkle and fire.  But the cost is low enough, if I find it wears out, and I am still interested in this style, I will simply replace it.  Images attached. one taken outdoors in sun, one in a shaded area.	2015-08-01

The smooth swirls, and lovely two toned filigree blend seamlessly. And I'm appreciative of the smooth back, which often goes left rough or unfinished. Bonus, for me the shading of the rose gold is exquisite.<br />The chain is very nice for a comes with the pendant chain, not really heavy duty, but not overly dainty either. I'm not worried about it snapping when I wear it, or tangling up.<br />Now lets talk where this otherwise gorgeous necklace loses stars, diamonds. Yes, it has them. Yes you can see them. Yes they sparkle. But, they are both tiny and very milky. I know that the clarity and rating reflects this, but I can't understand placing diamonds for the sake of saying 'oooh diamonds'. It would have been just as beautiful without, (if not more so).<br />Bottom line, is it worth it? For the price on amazon, it's a value. It's very pretty, and the packaging is great for gifting. Just have the right expectations so you aren't disappointed.	2015-08-01

You know the kind?  The ones that eat your quarters?<br />-<br />This set of earrings looks cheap. I wouldn't recommend them unless maybe you're in high school and don't know any better.	2015-08-01

I love these cufflinks, I got them for my significant other. He's not really into dressing up much, but even he was impressed by these. I like these statement cufflinks, I feel like they make you notice them without being gaudy or cartoonish in nature. These are brass cufflinks but they are painted and look like wonderful and classy stainless steel. These are made of out of nice sturdy material and it'll look you spent quite a pretty penny on these. These definitely look like they will last a long time.	2015-08-01

Jewelry	5	11	11	N	N	Substantial weight, well made piece.  The crystals are a gorgeous shade of blue	This is a beautiful costume jewelry set. I received it free in exchange for my honest review.  I would categorize the size as a bold look, but not as large as a statement piece.  The price is affordable (at least it is right now), and the Swarovski crystals are better quality than a comparable set you might buy at the mall.  The blue crystals are cut well, and have a full amount of sparkle.  My bracelet has three blue hearts, and they are all differing shades of blue. The clasp is easy to fasten; the necklace and bracelet have the same style of clasp.  The bracelet measures 8&#34; including the extender, but can be clasped shorter to fit a 6.5&#34; wrist.  The earrings have a 1.25&#34; drop from the top of the fish hook to the bottom; the heart piece alone is right under 3/4&#34;.  The backs of all the crystals are encased in metal, which I like because I have seen sets where the crystals are just painted silver on the back.  The necklace is 16&#34; with a 2&#34; extender, making it a full 18&#34;. This is a well made set; it's substantial and weighty and the crystals sparkle and shine.  It comes in a standard paper gift box; mine included a free gifted scarf/pocket square.  I actually photographed this set in a bigger box than it came it; the box that it ships in is much too small to display the jewelry nicely.	2015-08-01

First things first, I really enjoy my ring, it's very comfortable, I don't even notice it. However, if you do not like scuffs and or worn character on your jewelry then this ring may not be for you. I wear mine at work and it still looks very nice. But it does have visible scuffing on it, I've had it a couple weeks now. Also, something I noticed is that when I do wear my wedding band (tungsten and a deep charcoal color), this little ring has a tarnished appearance that I am not fond of. Alone it is a perfect little ring, but if your wearing it with anything other than white gold, it might not be pleasing to look at, especially for women, However, I do like it very much and would recommend it if you enjoy titanium jewelry. I personally don't mind the scuff appearance because the matte finish looks better with my skin tone than shiny finished pieces and it cleans well with soap and a soft cloth.	2015-08-01

I loved this ring so much that I ordered 2 more! One for each of my daughters that once they saw it had to have one too. I have gotten a ton of compliments on it also. I am a mom of 4 so I don't usually have time to take my jewelry of when needing to put my hands in water or cleaner or poo or anything else like that. So with that being said, after wearing for so long without taking it off I'm surprised to say it hasn't rusted, faded or turned my finger colors which is really saying something because usually anything not real, my skin gets a reaction to and turns my skin green underneath wherever I was wearing the jewelry. It's made from a very very durable metal. It's very thick. The stones are beautiful and don't look fake at all. The price for this ring compared to the quality is awesome. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the size. There size chart is a little off. I ordered a size 7 and it didn't fit the finger I was sizing it for and had to take a ring I usually wear off to wear this one on there. So while I do highly recommend this product, I would also recommend ordering a size up. Shipping was fast and other than sizing was as described by seller. I think I may actually order a size 8 so I can wear it on the finger I originally was purchasing it for.	2015-08-01

The photo makes them look like they have a little bit of a matte finish, but there is no matte, and they are very shiny.  The only issue I have with them is that they are all one piece, so the earrings are rather stiff looking, instead of hanging freely.  The backs that came with the earrings are very hard plastic and the holes in them are quite tiny so it is difficult to insert the earrings into them.  In fact, I promptly bent the earring the first time I tried to wear them.  However, I switched backs with another pair of earrings and they went on just fine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Very nice earrings at a great price for Sterling silver	2015-08-01

I did not know what to expect because of the low,low price however, the gold looks real as do the gem stones. They are just a little larger in size than I expected and normally wear but I love them and the change in size will be nice for a change.  The earrings were shipped from China with an earliest receipt date of 7/30/15.  I received them on that date.  Service was great!	2015-08-01

[[VIDEOID:b4e1b0b5dc045d99683db34fabc9db62]]This review is for the EleQueen Women's Silver-tone Cubic Zirconia Simulated Pearl Bridal Necklace Earrings Set Ivory Color.<br /><br />This delicate and glittery set is perfect for any bride or female heading to the prom in a gorgeous ball gown. The necklace comes with earrings to complete the look.<br /><br />The necklace features six ivory pearls that have a beautiful glow and luminescence to them. The pearls are accented by cubic zirconias in vine like shapes of shiny silver. It is intricate yet feminine at the same time. It will catch the eye of anyone you are around as the cubics hit the light and cause sparkles of shine to radiate.<br /><br />The earrings are light and comfortable. They are the perfect length and will look good on any age young to old. The necklace is not over the top... it is high detail but light. The earrings and necklace both have dangle movement to them. The pieces never flip around on your neckline or earlobes, and remain perfect looking all night.<br /><br />5/5 stars for design, delicateness and sparkle.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-01

The difference being that in the provided images, the PU (polyurethane) leather has a porous/grain-like texture to give it the appearance of genuine leather whereas the product I received is completely smooth (on the outer layer/face-out side). It's also a slightly darker shade of brown than shown in the images. Not bad for $5. Definitely not worth &#34;list price&#34; of $45	2015-08-01

Additional 3 reasons I gave this ring a 5-stars rating: 1) high quality white gold finish look, 2) gentle curve edge finish so it doesn’t look like it cut off from a metal pipe, and 3) affordable and friendly price of $22.95.  This ring gives me more than I expected.	2015-08-01

I included a picture and hopefully you guys will know what I mean by that.  I took a chance on this one because I was afraid the glued-on eyes would fall off of the other bracelet. That would defeat the purpose of the evil-eye bracelet. With this one, I don't have to worry! Plus, it's a decent price I suppose.<br /><br />Unhooked, the item is 7.5 inches in length. I thought I would include this for fitting purposes. The bracelet is gold as described and I've worn it for at least 5 times now. It seems to be sturdy and good quality.	2015-08-01

These earrings are pretty good, have not tarnished or are uncomfortable. It does take work to put them in but I learned that I can put them in backwards for certain holes. I am still questioning the smallest hoop because although it fits in one of my piercings, I cannot close it.  Either way, I would definitely suggest buying a set. I will probably buy some more if I lose them.	2015-08-01

He is super strong and has broken more than a couple of our items. My husband wants to wear the cross his father gave him but both of us have been going necklace-less for over a year now. When I saw that this necklace I hoped that the titanium aspect would help it stand up to the terrors of a toddler and, boy, has it!<br /><br />I ordered the 22&#34; necklace and it came super fast. It has a nice lobster clasp and is easy to open and get clasped without any help. The necklaces design is perfect. The silver is not so shiny and sparkly that a man could not wear it. It is quite strong and study. My son is very fascinated by my husband's cross and has been playing with it and pulling on it all day but it has not broken!<br /><br />I'm so glad I received this item at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I'm going to get one for me so I can start wearing my pendant again too.	2015-08-01

The item arrived quickly and it looks good, not cheap nor weakly constructed.  He mounted his piece on an existing (stronger) chain he's had for years, while she utilized the chain that comes with this item [and she LOVES IT].  Both pieces are of good size (not overbearing, yet can be easily spotted on them at several feet away.  I recommend this item.	2015-08-01

This ring was super cheap and with it being so you wouldn't think it would be made of good quality but it totally is! I have already ordered 2 of them as the first one I ordered got too small. My little girl is still wearing this one. I've had to change fingers as it got too little for the finger she had it on and when this one gets too little I will definitely be ordering another one of a bigger size. She doesn't take it off and on, she keeps it on constantly and it hasn't changed her finger colors at all. It's just the right thickness for little ones. Yes I would definitely recommend and will re-purchace. Shipping was fast and as described by seller.	2015-08-01

These Rhodium Plated Sterling Silver Earrings are just so sparkly and look good on the ears. I have worn them a few times to work and even on a date night and I always get compliments. I really love jewelry that can transition from work to night, and these fit that perfectly.<br /><br />I am always worried about quality, especially when I read the words plated... but these are very well made and haven't caused any sensitive reactions in my ears. They are also very comfortable to wear, as they are not too heavy. They also work well for many different age types. I have a little sister and I think these would make the perfect sweet 16 gift, as they are not your childish plastic earrings but they are also not some high end design that a high school student should be wearing.<br /><br />I feel for the quality that you get and how beautiful they sparkle, I have to recommend these to everyone.	2015-08-01

This bracelet is very well made, I always wear it and so far it hasn't been damaged....at all. with everyday wear I managed to make some scratches, however they are only noticeable if you inspect it closely.

US	52389452	R1BQBJ41JCA6TN	B00C20OJ12	385891968	Sterling Silver Oxidized Marcasite and Garnet Colored Glass Textured Teardrop Wire Dangle Earrings	Jewelry	3	1	1	Y	N	Fun marcasite and sterling earrings, but overpriced	I love marcasite and sterling jewelry, and was excited to give these a try. I find them a little disappointing, but mostly a lot of fun. Now that I have it in my hands, the marcasites are smaller and stingier than I think they should be, and the silver is too white<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Fun baubles that look a lot like they're presented here.<br />2. Marcasite and sterling silver, though the red part is glass.<br />3. Not &#34;too heavy&#34;, though definitely heavier than most other earrings I wear.<br />4. Come in the lovely black with blue accents Amazon Collection box, so they are nice gifts.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I think the design is a little quirky, and I don't quite get the swirly shapes on the back.<br />2. I don't know what Amazon does with their sterling silver. It's very white, and sterling naturally has a warmer tone.<br />3. I wish these were lever backs; I find the hooks and the plastic keepers don't look as nice to my mind. In this case, the wires look sort of cheap next to the rest of the earring, because they are relatively thin wires as compared to the relatively solid earrings.<br />4. I am confused by the pricing on these; currently $46.25. These should be maybe $25 or $30.<br /><br />Other:<br />1. The listing is off, saying 38 marcasite stones in one place and 8 marcasite stones in another. I think there are 23 stones in each earring and 46 total.<br />2. As with the other Amazon Collection sterling items I've gotten, they are stamped on the back with &#34;PAJ 925&#34; and &#34;China&#34;. Googling tells me that PAJ refers to the maker; 925 of course refers to the silver, and China, of course, is the country of manufacture.<br /><br />I took the picture attached here both to compare with an more &#34;classic&#34; marcasite and to compare to the size of a quarter (and to show the little plastic earring back that comes with each earring). The older earring has had a chance to develop a patina, but I'm not sure the Amazon one ever will. It just seems like the metal is coated or treated somehow, and I wish Amazon were straightforward about what they're doing with their sterling.<br /><br />I think they're fun earrings, but they are a little disappointing, too.ward about what they're doing with their sterling.  I think they're fun earrings, but they are a little disappointing, too.	2015-08-01

However, they have short post backings on the back, so when you have them on, they feel tight.

I own many pairs of metal double flared tunnels and these are the most perfect metal double flared tunnels I have owned. I love everything about all of MYSTICMETALS metal double flared tunnels: the price, the material, the lightness, and I love the perfect width/height of the actual flares (they aren't big/chunky like some of my other tunnels which makes the actual hole/tunnel look smaller than it actually is).<br /><br />I'm not trying to take business away from Amazon but I found it was cheaper to order from MYSTICMETALS website because their shipping is so much cheaper. Here on Amazon they charge $5 but on their own website their shipping is just $2.99. And for my order of 6 tunnels I was charged just ONE shipping fee of $2.99 and not 6 shipping charges.<br /><br />Anyway, check out my pics of the tunnels I order from MYSTICMETALS website. Hopefully it will give you potential customers a better idea of what the metal double flared tunnels actually look like. In the pics all the pairs are 00g (10mm) and the silver tunnel in the middle of the pics is my old 0g (8mm) just so people can see the difference between 00g and 0g side by side.<br /><br />P.S. The colors I bought are: silver, black, rainbow, blue, gold, and their thin walled blue silicone tunnels.	2015-08-01

Just got them in today and the ETA was August 20 through September 8, so i was pleasantly surprised to see that they arrived only 6 days after ordering. They came in a small, gray, and bubble wrapped envelope and when i opened it, the earrings came in two separate sealed plastic bags. Opened both, was worried that the guage size was too big, but they slipped in perfectly!<br /><br />The only difficulty was in trying to screw the backing in. The hole is small so it was hard to put it on easily, but it only took 5 minutes to get both in.<br />*THE EARRINGS SCREW IN INSTEAD OF PUSHING THEM IN*<br /><br />Just tried lying down to see if they would bother me at all when sleeping; theres minimal discomfort to the point where I'm able to sleep with them in without worry.<br /><br />My ears kinda feel weird though, maybe this is just trying to get used to the weight of them, which is light and not heavy at all but a different weight than my previous earrings.	2015-08-01

The ocean blue color is very pretty, and since the chain is so thin it almost looks like the pendant is hanging without a chain around my neck - I love it!<br /><br />One of my favorite necklaces to wear out - the color is true to the description and picture, the blue almost matches the color in my eyes and is a great compliment to many of my outfits I have for special occasions.<br /><br />The blue color is very eye catching and the light really makes this pendant grab attention whenever light shines onto it - very sparkly! The chain holds the pendant well, and it is long enough that I don't feel like it's choking me. This would be a lovely gift for someone special! Sample provided for evaluation and review.	2015-08-01

It is a shame to rate this ring so low because the stones are nice (even though they are lighter tanzanite) and it is a gorgeous ring.  My problem with it is that as pretty as it is, it can't be worn.  The metal is hefty and the stones go all the way around without being channel set.  This means fingers on either side of the finger where it is worn are scraped and pinched consistently by the stones.  It hurts to wear this ring.	2015-08-01

Reviews stating that it wasn't for every day wear because of them gem would fall out and reviews about how tiny and cute it was; but with the price being as cheap as it was I decided to just buy it and try it for myself. Like the reviews said it was tiny and so adorable; but sadly my gem did fall out. Some reviewers said there gem fell out Within a couple of weeks but mine lasted for at least 4 or 5 months. Which i guess then would have been a good time to just change it anyways. Even after losing them gem I left the piercing in for awhile afterwards. It wasn't the cutest thing but it was tiny and hardly noticeable to didn't really affect anything. I recommend this piercing especially if you are changing yours for the first time. I personally find the L shaped ones to be the easiest to put In and take out.	2015-08-01

When my fianc&eacute;'s ring arrived, it was a little big and we decided we should size down a half size.  I emailed the sellers at Amberly West last Sunday afternoon and received a response almost immediately, letting me know that an exchange would be no problem, and providing instructions.  By Friday, I'd return the original ring and received the new one!  I was so pleased with the service and flexibility of this seller and will definitely be considering them for future purchases.  Highly recommend.	2015-08-01

This is a decent men's ring, however, the outside edge is not round, it is geometrically shaped which leaves points around the entire outside diameter.

We've had them about a month now, and thus far are very satisfied. They arrived as described simply packaged in just a plastic bag placed in a small cloth pouch. At first, my wife was hesitant to wear the ring often, because she was afraid it would be scratched or nicked. But I explained to her the material was tungsten carbide, which is one of the hardest ring substances out there, and one of the best priced. Thus far, neither of our rings show any sign of wear at all after more than a month of use, which is what I expected and hoped for. They're comfortable to wear, and to me at least, almost have a shiny, light reflecting coloration that looks like stainless steel, which is fine. The coloration of the ring is not dark at all, and in fact, on our fingers, looks much lighter and more shiny/reflective than the photos posted on the Amazon listing.	2015-08-01

Couldn't have been more pleased with this CZ bar necklace!

I also liked that it came with a 2&#34; extender as this is very handy to have depending on the neckline of the top one is wearing.

I own many pairs of metal double flared tunnels and these are the most perfect metal double flared tunnels I have owned. I love everything about all of MYSTICMETALS metal double flared tunnels: the price, the material, the lightness, and I love the perfect width/height of the actual flares (they aren't big/chunky like some of my other tunnels which makes the actual hole/tunnel look smaller than it actually is).<br /><br />I'm not trying to take business away from Amazon but I found it was cheaper to order from MYSTICMETALS website because their shipping is so much cheaper. Here on Amazon they charge $5 but on their own website their shipping is just $2.99. And for my order of 6 tunnels I was charged just ONE shipping fee of $2.99 and not 6 shipping charges.<br /><br />Anyway, check out my pics of the tunnels I order from MYSTICMETALS website. Hopefully it will give you potential customers a better idea of what the metal double flared tunnels actually look like. In the pics all the pairs are 00g (10mm) and the silver tunnel in the middle of the pics is my old 0g (8mm) just so people can see the difference between 00g and 0g side by side.<br /><br />P.S. The colors I bought are: silver, black, rainbow, blue, gold, and their thin walled blue silicone tunnels.	2015-08-01

The diamonds are big enough to be visible but they are completely opaque and cloudy. It's pretty much what I expected from the piece, but you should just not expect to have this shiny, glittering diamonds, because that's not what you typically get if you don't spend hundreds of dollars.<br /><br />The earrings themselves were pretty. It was a nice design - a nice twist to a hoop. They felt well made and substantial. They are very wearable - I could see wearing them to an office or on a casual day with jeans or you can dress them up and wear them to a fancy event. They look like yellow gold, although it is plated over sterling silver. They weren't too heavy so were comfortable to wear. The closure is easy to do. They were a good size - large enough to be noticed but not too large that they seemed overwhelming. Overall a reasonable choice for someone who wants substantial diamond earrings but doesn't have hundreds and hundreds to spend.	2015-08-01

[[VIDEOID:8a66bc91b4afd41ea1ab8a83b6da99e6]]This is a beautiful necklace that is elegant and has an expensive look to it.  The chain is extremely delicate and the clasp tiny (so make sure you have the nails you need to open it).  While on the video I mention that I was unable to separate the inner heart to see the engraving, once I gave more slack to the chain I had no more problems.  It is clearly visible and gives the necklace a personal and loving touch.<br /><br />Overall I really love this necklace.  It is perfect to wear with a little black dress when going out on the town or even with jeans on those days that I want to show people I am loved.  Great necklace!<br /><br />Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned.

I got this after my husband thought it was kind of cool.  I thought it was different and wasn't really sure. I thought the dinosaur was going to be small but it is very large.

It is very good quality and the different pieces of the dinosaur are clearly visible and easy to tell what they are.  It is a very cute necklace.

Stainless steel is great for the sensitivity issue, and and the small size is good for my ears not to be overwhelmed by my multiple piercings.  The posts are long as noted in other reviews here.  I take my earrings out and clean them with jewelry cleaner and then rinse with water every night (only takes a minute and all my earrings always sparkle like new) so this is not an issue for me.<br /><br />The fun part is wearing these cute earrings is in summer with the thunderstorms all around, and on Thursday, &#34;Thor's day&#34;; which some claim is named after that hammer-wielding God of thunder.  The earrings (as well as several other pairs of Sabrina Silver earrings I have ordered), arrived quickly, packaged in a silver (what else lol) box which is suitable for gifting.	2015-08-01

Take it from someone who got burned!!!!!	UPDATE!!!!!!!!  Well, I take it back!  These are not well made.  :(  Trying to put the back-stopper on completely bent one earring so badly it just looks silly now.  I tried as delicately as I could to put it back into shape, and it just made it look worse.  So bummed!  I wanted to like these sooo much!  Waste of my hard earned $$ forsure!  I got to wear them once, and they kept falling out.  So, I then spent more $ to buy stoppers, that don't go on well bc the earring is just a hair bigger around than the backing hole.<br /><br />These are very pretty, well made earrings.  But, they are very delicate.  Not something you would want to leave in and go to bed.  Only downside was I had to buy back stoppers since they are not included, and without them they do tend to come out.  But, all in all I recommend.  I feel very dainty wearing these, and have gotten many complements.	2015-08-01

I love this pair of earrings and I can wear them with almost anything.<br /><br />They look good with jeans and a sweater and they also look nice with a dress and high heels. I especially like having both the gold and the silver hoops together because I tend to wear both metals together anyway.<br /><br />They feel substantial but aren't heavy when I'm wearing them, which is a big plus.<br /><br />And I like that they are 18k gold plated and sterling silver.

I was skeptical to buy earrings online that I could not see beforehand but gave it a shot.  We had tried several previous earrings that claimed to be safe for small children or have &#34;screw backs&#34; and my daughter always got them out.  We were constantly losing earrings or backs and scared that she could choke if happened to put one in her moth.  These have been a beautiful reprieve.  She has ben wearing them for months and no issues.  They truly screw on.  They are not heavy or large so they do not bother her.  They do not irritate her sensitive skin and they look just as beautiful as the day we bought them.  She wears them 24/7 including shower/swimming, sleeping, and during activities.  Highly recommend especially for parents looking for their toddlers or children with metal allergies.<br />2016- we just bought our second pair of these earrings for our daughter who just turned 3. We still love these. They are snug in her ears and any other style she removes on her own. They look expensive and she gets lots of compliments and we don't have to worry about losing them.	2015-08-01

In the photo these look a bit larger than they actually are.<br /><br />Now then, I have to say that I've been impressed with the Amazon curated jewelry.  For the most part it's been well made, interesting, and offered at a compelling price point.  These are no exception.<br /><br />With hanging earrings it's possible for the designer to really show off the gem.  As light can freely enter the setting from more than one angle, it also offers a bit of a challenge to show off the gem without overpowering it.  I think this setting does a good job of making the sapphire the star.  The companion stones are also cut so they catch light, but don't distract from the main gem.  It makes for an eye catching piece that is very complimentary.<br /><br />The clasp seems a bit fragile to me, at least to open and close.  Once closed it seems secure and I don't think there's worry about these falling out.  That said, the wire does bend rather easily (which is, to be fair, by design) and I think more-than-normal care is needed to make sure these don't get too out of true.<br /><br />Presentation is typical Amazon - high quality boxes-within-boxes, with matte black accented by royal blue.  I do think the box is a bit large for the product, which I think takes away from the impact of the earrings when the box is opened.<br /><br />So the takeaway - very nice quality setting with a somewhat fragile clasp.  If these are for gifting, transferring them to another box isn't a bad idea.  But I think they look interesting.  A good product!	2015-08-01

I own many pairs of metal double flared tunnels and these are the most perfect metal double flared tunnels I have owned. I love everything about all of MYSTICMETALS metal double flared tunnels: the price, the material, the lightness, and I love the perfect width/height of the actual flares (they aren't big/chunky like some of my other tunnels which makes the actual hole/tunnel look smaller than it actually is).<br /><br />I'm not trying to take business away from Amazon but I found it was cheaper to order from MYSTICMETALS website because their shipping is so much cheaper. Here on Amazon they charge $5 but on their own website their shipping is just $2.99. And for my order of 6 tunnels I was charged just ONE shipping fee of $2.99 and not 6 shipping charges.<br /><br />Anyway, check out my pics of the tunnels I order from MYSTICMETALS website. Hopefully it will give you potential customers a better idea of what the metal double flared tunnels actually look like. In the pics all the pairs are 00g (10mm) and the silver tunnel in the middle of the pics is my old 0g (8mm) just so people can see the difference between 00g and 0g side by side.<br /><br />P.S. The colors I bought are: silver, black, rainbow, blue, gold, and their thin walled blue silicone tunnels.	2015-08-01

So if it breaks while you are wearing it, you will get cut up pretty good. I had one shatter when it fell a flight of stairs and hit brick. Shattered in about five pieces.<br />The other is, if you manage to bend it, the doctor will not be able to cut it off. Their tools are carbide.	2015-08-01

However, I liked the design on the front enough to make the trade off.<br /><br />I believe these are available for every letter of the alphabet.  When you order, make sure your item starts with the letter you want to display on the charm.<br /><br />Examples:<br />This product displays an &#34;A&#34;<br />A - Large Solid 925 Sterling Silver with Black Finish Szira Collection Paw and Hearts Monogram Initial A Charm, Pendant, Key Ring, for Dog, Cat or Person<br /><br />This product displays a &#34;T&#34;<br />T - Large Solid 925 Sterling Silver with Black Finish Szira Collection Paw and Hearts Monogram Initial A Charm, Pendant, Key Ring, for Dog, Cat or Person<br /><br />Additionally, check the width and height on the Product Specification.  There are 3 different sizes.<br /><br />If the letter and size combination currently you want are not available, contact the seller Sziro Jewelry Designs.  I wanted 4 of these and only 1 was available.  Sziro Jewelry Designs responded to my inquiry their next business day.	2015-08-01

The colors aren't even close to as vibrant as pictured. The 2 larger blues almost appear to be the same blue vs. distinctly different. They lack sparkle. Not nearly as impressive as I had hoped they'd be.<br />The posts are nice and long but the backs are flimsy and basic.<br />To top it off, the packaging is extremely unimpressive. They came in a fairly large, paperboard box with a 'made in china' sticker on the back. When opened, the earrings sit all the way to the front on a folded paperboard. These really lacked in presentation and I would not suggest them as a gift.	2015-08-01

No thanks...	I bought this set for me and husband as an alternative to our wedding rings because we are active people with a rich irish heritage. I was so excited to recieve them but was disappointed when I opened the package. The design is cheaply printed on the bands and it's so small you can't even tell what it is till you look up close. I was willing to overlook it but by the third time I wore it its badly rubbed off already. Waste of money. Only good part is after inspecting it closer, I found out it was a QALO band which is what I was going to buy next. Given some time, it'll be the black band I was planning to buy anyway it just stinks to not have the celtic design.   Another point I wanted to add was the crazy shipping for ridiculously light items to ship. Also I originally needed to exchange my husbands because it was my fault I bought the wrong size but to charge me an ADDITIONAL  $6+ in shipping back was a deal breaker for this Prime member. I would request a refund for them entirely but decided I'd rather not spend $6 to ship them back and use them as backups for some other time.	2015-08-01

Save your money and buy white gold. This is either poor quality silver or it just sucks. It dulls very fast when worn, and takes a lot to get the original polish. Which may I say was beautiful. But I'm noticing that there's little imperfections in the links, like black dots and looks as if the silver is almost peeling off. I don't know how to describe it. But I do not recommend at this price, anything above 50 bucks just don't make sense.

I ordered these because they had a nice steampunk vibe and I loved the garnet color in the image. I was a little disappointed when they arrived because they are so much larger than the image suggests. About the size of the end of your thumb, or a grape, I'd say.

I was slightly worried about ordering it after reading some of the poor reviews, but they must have just been unfortunate events. The thing to understand is that this is not fine jewelry. This is fashion jewelry which means it shouldn't be held up to the same standards as an engagement or wedding ring would be.<br /><br />I have had my ring for almost three weeks now and there is NO bending of band and NONE of the stones have fallen out. The center stone is only slightly loose but has not even begun to threaten to fall out. I wear this ring every day to my job as a receptionist as a salon where I am constantly running laundry and snagging it on towels. I am very pleased with how this ring has held up. There are some minor scratches at the bottom of the band, but that is to be expected with sterling silver.<br /><br />As far as the color of the center stone is concerned, this is not the ring to get if you are expecting a dark green stone. Also, a dark stone is NOT what is pictured. The stone in my ring is a very faint, but beautifully, pale green stone. Wearing green makes the color pop, but wearing it with anything else doesn't cause the ring to clash with your style.<br /><br />This product would have received five stars if the center stone was perfectly secured in place, but for a fairly inexpensive purchase, this ring is great!	2015-08-01

[[VIDEOID:c401d190cd9ddfb0510b49bab175b30e]]This review is for the EleQueen Women's Gold-tone Cream Simulated Pearl Reversible Double Dangle Earrings Ivory Color.<br /><br />This set of unique earrings is very delicate and very cute. The earrings came to me in a signature EleQueen powder blue jewelry box with matching pink velvet bag. I am able to store the earrings in the bag, it keeps them tangle free and super shiny.<br /><br />The luster on the pearls is very luminescent and ivory. They look extremely realistic. The wires are gold color and attach the two pearl balls to each other - but also go through the hole on your earlobe. It is a SUPER thin wire. I would say even thinner than an earring hook but probably about that size.<br /><br />The most unique part of these earrings are the backings. The backing IS the second pearl ball. The wire goes through the smaller pearl and holds the earring secure to your lobe. It is VERY easy to use. If you decide you don't like that style - EleQueen has included normal gold earring backs so you can switch out the second pearl ball. It also gives a different look from unique to traditional, so it's fun to play around with the two depending on the outfit you are wearing.<br /><br />5/5 stars for beautiful, uniqueness of design, and materials of gold and pearls.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-01

I own many pairs of thin walled silicone tunnels and these are the most perfect thin walled tunnels I have owned. I love everything about all of MYSTICMETALS thin walled silicone tunnels: the price, the material, the lightness, and I love the that these thin walled tunnels actually make your hole/tunnel look bigger than it is.<br /><br />Now I've ordered from MYSTICMETALS a couple of times and I've been very pleased with their customer service, prices, selection, and their shipping is SUPER fast. My order from their site arrived in less than 48 hours from when I placed my order and they're in Ohio and I'm all the way in Hawaii.<br /><br />I'm not trying to take business away from Amazon but I found it was cheaper to order from MYSTICMETALS website because their shipping is so much cheaper. Here on Amazon they charge $5 but on their own website their shipping is just $2.99. And for my order of 6 tunnels I was charged just ONE shipping fee of $2.99 and not 6 shipping charges.<br /><br />Anyway, check out my pics of the tunnels I order from MYSTICMETALS website. Hopefully it will give you potential customers a better idea of what the metal double flared tunnels actually look like. In the pics all the pairs are 00g (10mm) and the silver tunnel in the middle of the pics is my old 0g (8mm) just so people can see the difference between 00g and 0g side by side.<br /><br />P.S. The colors I bought are: silver, black, rainbow, blue, gold, and their thin walled blue silicone tunnels (I already own their black, white, clear, and red thin walled silicone tunnels and I love them all, especially their clear ones.	2015-08-01

It's nice looking, though I'm not sure about the straight, &#34;post&#34; design. Is it supposed to be a stauros? The little diamonds are, well, very little. But again, at this price point the idea is to provide just a flash of fanciness - not a showstopper. The chain is kinda wimpy, but again it is what it is. The full retail price is kind of a joke, but that's why it's currently 64% discounted. Another reviewer mentioned having a &#34;jewelry starved&#34; wife and that pretty much describes my situation as well. The wife likes it, so job done. But I never get her jewelry so she'd be happy with something out of a gumball machine most likely.	2015-08-01

My order from their site arrived in less than 48 hours from when I placed my order and they're in Ohio and I'm all the way in Hawaii.<br /><br />I'm not trying to take business away from Amazon but I found it was cheaper to order from MYSTICMETALS website because their shipping is so much cheaper. Here on Amazon they charge $5 but on their own website their shipping is just $2.99. And for my order of 6 tunnels I was charged just ONE shipping fee of $2.99 and not 6 shipping charges.<br /><br />Anyway, check out my pics of the tunnels I order from MYSTICMETALS website. Hopefully it will give you potential customers a better idea of what the metal double flared tunnels actually look like. In the pics all the pairs are 00g (10mm) and the silver tunnel in the middle of the pics is my old 0g (8mm) just so people can see the difference between 00g and 0g side by side.<br /><br />P.S. The colors I bought are: silver, black, rainbow, blue, gold, and their thin walled blue silicone tunnels. And these rainbow ones are actually pretty cool looking and quite trippy like a nice acid trip.	2015-08-01

Wish I could give more:)	This ring is just perfect. I ordered it for my fianc&eacute; for his wedding ring, and he loves it just as much. It looks so much better in person as well. I definitely recommend this ring to anyone who's thinking about buying it. It fits true to the size it says. I'm so glad I was able to get this product at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest unbiased review. I had been looking at a few different rings, including this one, and happened to come across a offer for this. I showed all of the rings that I had liked to my fianc&eacute;, and he had picked this one out as his favorite. (Which he didn't even know that I had a discount for this). So it was a win win situation. He's a hunter, and so am I, so this definitely will be perfect for him to wear for the rest of our lives after August 28th, 2015. :) he tried it on today when it came in the mail. The only con I have about it, is that it is a little &#34;heavy&#34;, but not a Big deal at all. And I'm happy that I made this purchase.	2015-08-01

We've had them about a month now, and thus far are very satisfied. They arrived as described simply packaged in just a plastic bag placed in a small cloth pouch. At first, my wife was hesitant to wear the ring often, because she was afraid it would be scratched or nicked. But I explained to her the material was tungsten carbide, which is one of the hardest ring substances out there, and one of the best priced. Thus far, neither of our rings show any sign of wear at all after more than a month of use, which is what I expected and hoped for. They're comfortable to wear, and to me at least, almost have a shiny, light reflecting coloration that looks like stainless steel, which is fine. The coloration of the ring is not dark at all, and in fact, on our fingers, looks much lighter and more shiny/reflective than the photos posted on the Amazon listing.	2015-08-01

I really like this ring, because it's different. Since this is a stainless steel nail looking type ring that stretched around your finger, it's really cool.<br /><br />I know that it says its a screw head, but there's no inserts in the head for screwdriver to have gone, so I definitely think it's more of a regular nail, but it is still really unique and I totally love it. I can see around the head of the nail where there's 4 lines, so if that's the part that's supposed to be true, I don't think that it's really enough to call it a screw, but there's nothing wrong with this being called a nail ring. Because it's still really different.<br /><br />I was really hoping that this ring would not be uncomfortable, and surprisingly it is not! It is definitely not a comfort fit ring, but because of its design, it doesn't have to be a comfort fit because it's not flat on the inside. That part is actually really awesome and I think it's probably more comfortable than a comfort fit because it's shaped circularly the whole way around like your finger is.<br /><br />The cubic zirconia stones there in the string are very pretty, and I love that they are at the tip of the nail! Or screw. It definitely makes the ring pop a little bit more having the stones on both ends.<br /><br />This is a very beautiful ring, & I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wanted to be different, and did not want to have a plane and/or boring ring. This is definitely well made, it's beautiful, and it is unisex which gives it its own uniqueness in itself.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.	2015-08-01

I don't see any grey. Second, this is a very beautiful bracelet but runs BIG... which is bizarre because everything from overseas tend to run small. Very dainty, feminine braclet. The bracelet length is big, but the pendants are rather small.  Overall, very beautiful bracelet. It slides a little since it runs big.. but very pretty for casual wear or fancy wear. Cheaply made, but what do you expect? $3 for a cute, small, delicate bracelet is the perfect price.  FYI, picture does make it look big because it's up close. None the less, it's a beautiful piece. :)	2015-08-01

I don't really like silver colored jewelry. So the second hoop was given to a friend and was of no use to me. But the gold one looks good! I wish I could have bought it by itself, but oh well! The metal is really strong. I have a very small nose so I had to bend it to be a little smaller which was really difficult to do. I even tried pliers. After quite a bit of effort I got it to bend a little. I'd still like it to be smaller, but I don't think that's happening. Still! It fits much better than before and looks good. Sometimes the hoop swivels a little so you can see the opening and the blunt end and that doesn't look great. But for the most part it stays in place.	2015-08-01

I wore it for a week while working (barista) and one of the braided ends (where the clip is located to attach the two ends together) came loose from the buckle. It's pretty easy to rebraid and re-clip (it's just like adjusting/re-clipping skateboard belts) but I can see the possibility of losing it fairly easily if it were to fall off of your wrist during certain activities (swimming, skating, etc.). Still, it's not a deal-breaker considering the fact that I only paid $3 for it (but with that said, it is absolutely not worth anywhere near the &#34;list price&#34; of $45.00) . For it's current price, I'd definitely recommend it. 6/10	2015-08-01

These earrings are not only attractive and classy-looking, but they don't bother my ears at all. They're light-weight and I forget I'm wearing them. I also love the fact that the earrings come with two backs - the typical metal back and the softer, plastic back which I prefer. I love these earrings and am happy I tried them.	2015-08-01

Jewelry	5	6	7	N	N	Nice costume statement jewelry set, stones are cut well	I have a lot of jewelry from Qianse, and got this for a gift.  I am going to be giving it to my mother in law for Christmas. It's statement costume jewelry, and definitely more her style than mine.  The crystals are cut well, and are a beautiful deep blue color. The pieces are weighty and substantial.  The necklace itself has six crystal up each side, then metal the rest of the way up.  It measures 18&#34; with a 2&#34; extender, making it 20&#34; total. The pendant has a 1&#34; drop. It's easy to clasp.  The bracelet is 7&#34; with a 1&#34; extender, 8&#34; total.  The post earrings have a 1&#34; drop. I appreciate that the crystals are encased in metal, instead of just being painted silver on the back like some cheaper sets sometimes are.  The set comes in a standard paper gift box that is too small for the set, I actually photographed it in a bigger box.  It included a free small scarf.  This set is not my personal style, but I know for a fact she will be delighted with it.  I received it free in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-01

Looks good but the clasp is poorly made and does not keep the Cord Necklace Chain stably on the neck. It keeps opening all the time! I tried to wear it for two days and at the second day it dropped from my neck at work when I was just walking from one place to another. I even didn't notice that! My workmate found it and returned it to me. After that I never put it back on my neck!<br /><br />Beside the problem with the clasp the cord is very nice and I am really disappointed that I cannot use it.	2015-08-01

I really am very happy with these pretty earrings. I am petite with short hair and a short neck and they really seem to suit me. They seem to be solid and well made. The filigree is very pretty. They don't seem to be oxidized, which doesn't bother me. They seem to be solid and well made, The only issues I have with these is that the wires on mine seem to be wide and yet they were sold without stoppers, which really is not a problem since I put a pair of stoppers I already had on them, and there doesn't seem to be a pendant to match them. I would really love to get a matching pendant (or close to matching) that would be just a little bit bigger, That tells you how much I am enjoying these earrings.  They will probably become a favorite pair.  I highly recommend them.	2015-08-01

One disclaimer, the amethyst is a lot darker than what is pictured, more of a royal purple. Although, since these are natural mined stone VS. laboratory grown I'm sure this can vary, the jeweler did a very fine job of matching all the stones to be the same color on the bracelet.<br />Very happy with this purchase!	2015-08-01

It slips off your ear pretty easily. Might have to try it out a few more times but probably won't buy this earring again.	2015-08-01

It doesn't move or swing around on my finger like other rings can because of the way it's designed! :) It's two rings in one, I see hearts or clovers . . . .	2015-08-01

The front of the ring is a little wider in the  than in the back which I'm not sure I expected.  I have arthritis in my hands so being adjustable is helpful.  I am happy with my purchase.	2015-08-01

Not what I expected. It's a little more cheaply made than what I thought. If I had seen this in a store, I definitely would not have bought. The ring doesn't lay flat, and is always in an awkward position on the cross. I also noticed a couple of misspelled words in the prayer.	2015-08-01
