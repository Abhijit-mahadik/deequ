The ONLY way you can tell this apart from an OEM controller is the missing Nintendo logo, and props to Cirka for not slapping on an uglier one in its place.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the buttons & stick were pretty stiff at first, but 'twas nothing some WD-40 and a couple rounds of Fox vs. Captain Falcon couldn't remedy. Seriously, it just needs to be broken in.<br /><br />Now, when my friends all gather for drunken late-night Kario Mart, it's the first controller to be pounced on, leaving the once superior OG's to wonder when was the last time in life they felt young.	2015-08-21

Get it only at the cheapest price possible.	First off, let's talk about the sound mixing. Who ever did that should be fired, or retaught, just something. The first thing I did before starting my game was turn down the background music a bit and turned up the voices up a bit, and then I started the game. Through out the entire intro I felt the BG music was just to loud and was overpowering the voice acting. Especially for those characters with softer voices.So after the whole beginning part of the game the first thing I do is once again turn down the music and turn up the voice acting. At this point the voice is a max and the BG music is at the next to lowest setting, and guess what background music is still kinda loud compared to the voice acting. Now I just play the game on the lowest setting of background music and the highest setting voices. But be warned these settings don't effect the anime cut-scenes so when they occur do your best to pay attention in case a character says something because yes again the problem occurs again where the voice acting volume is way to low compared to the music and there's no subtitles.  Labyrinth and Battle System Now I'm a kind of person who doesn't mind grinding for hours on end. In fact I love grinding, I'll get lost in grinding sometimes and be like &#34;Oh yeah I should continue the story huh?&#34;. As long as the game is fun and they have a nice battle system, I don't mind grinding at all, I never go out of my way to avoid battles. That being said, I thought fighting in this game and just overall the whole Labyrinth places to be horribly boring. Playing the demo, the battle system is unique, and I was excited for the actual game to see how it might expand upon it further, but eehhh.... It's like any turn-based system (that don't try to expand upon it more to make it fun) it was literally for me just attacking every turn. Even if I used magic skills, it didn't feel like I was doing much other than you know, attacking. In fact fighting is so boring in his game for me, this is the first game where I really use the &#34;auto&#34; battle function, like there's no point in fighting it out myself. I mean for bosses I'll turn it off because I mean come on it's the boss, but again the battle system isn't very fun to me, not even a boss can fix that. Getting into battles with the monsters is also kind of awkward, while you're in the Labyrinth there's no way to like swing your weapon or slash, just anything to attack (as far as I know) so the way to engage in battle with them is just to...walk into them. Now the problem with this is they have a &#34;advantage&#34; and &#34;ambush&#34; system, so sometimes I'll literally walk into deadpan but it'll count as an ambush on my part, and it's just a little frustrating 'cause that's just extra damage to heal off afterwards. The Labyrinths themselves are dull too, it's not like it has cool music or anything, and they don't change aesthetically enough from each other to give the player the whole &#34;wow this place is cool&#34; feeling. It's just a different colored, different wall textured place, nothing exciting. And since all Labyrinth's are just kinda the same you just kinda see the same kind of enemy over and over. It's not like in other RPG's where there's like areas so you'll see like wolves and pixie's in the forest and then like sand worms and scorpions in the dessert. It's just kinda of same 'ole same 'ole just stronger. I mean at least in regular RPG's there's a large space between seeing monster A and monster A recolored and stronger to keep it from being dull. But in this game you see like 3 versions of monster A in the span of like 2-3 Labyrinths and that's like 1-3 chapters of the game. The camera in the Labyrinth is kinda awkward too, not awkward as in it doesn't work or really ruin the game. The camera is just...really close and directly behind to the main character. Every time I go in there I just really wish I could zoom out a little. so I can like see more around me. Like treasure and the monsters. I mean you can rotate the camera and it helps....a little. But I really want to like zoom out, and I haven't found a way to zoom out. Like when you go thru a door the first thing you'll see is nothing because the silhouette of the door you just went through will be blocking the view of the entire room. I don't know I just think it's horrible. I honestly dread needing to go into the Labyrinth at all, navigating around there is boring, the fighting is boring. So why would you ever play this game if the core game play of this game is so bad?  Characters and the Heroines! Let's face it, and don't even try to deny it. The main reason we all got this game is to romance us a Waifu and make the &#34;star&#34; kids. The one thing that kept me going in this game the characters and the girls, I think that they're nicely written. Even the characters that aren't the main girls are really interesting! And the whole mechanic of making star kids is really cute. Even with the Labyrinth being as HORRIBLY DULL, I love reading the star kid's banter that'll pop up in there. It really gets ya attached to the little guys. And with 7 girls to choose from I'm sure you'll be able to find one that you like best.  Music I'm going to say this now, the music isn't all too noticeable, it's pretty bland and forgettable. I mean yes there ARE songs that are good. The classmating song, the song that comes up when you're making a star kid, but that's the thing they're the special songs that only appear while you're doing those things. But other than the select few, the music is pretty well, same 'ole same 'ole. You know the generic RPG stuff that you'd expect to hear. The battle song is pretty unique but after a bazillion battles it gets kinda dull. Especially for me since I hate battling in this game so much.  Quests and the Stores Did you know that in this game you can repeatedly do the same quest over and over again? Even when you complete a quest, you can just do it again. Thequests are really dull, doesn't feel like you're helping anyone, or anything. It literally just feels like they put quests in for the purpose of having quests in the game because RPG's normally have quests. But like normally the rewards aren't really worth it, and the only ones really &#34;worth&#34; doing are the &#34;special&#34; ones because they're kinda story related and give you upgrade parts for the girl's weapons. You could easily stock up on supplies by doing the same guild quest over and over again. There's like no point to the store in this game because of this. Even for equipment, because most likely you'll just find something that's better in the Labyrinth anyway. The only real thing you'll go to the store for is to buy the Labyrinth escape item, but otherwise. The store is pretty meaningless thanks to the quests, and that's not really good, since the quests are just there to be quests. The only REAL store you'll actually spend a large sum of your money at and visit on a somewhat regular basis is the Gift Shop, to buy gifts for your waifus.  Voice Acting I think the voice acting is really good, and I think each voice fits every character. The only problem is actually hearing it because the sound mixing is pretty horrible. Crank that Background music to 1 yo.  Story At first I was kinda invested in the main story, but during chapter 3-4 the scientist character does a dumb thing that doesn't make sense and the game justifies it was the right thing to do, and like literally no scientist thinks like that and it made no sense. And it just soured the whole experience for me. Like not only is the gameplay boring, but now the story isn't even good enough for me to continue playing it.	2015-08-21

I'm very unsatisfied with this product. I didn't have it for more that 2 hours and it went from black and grey to Brown and purple. Don't buy this product. I'm a huge Zelda fan and this is a major disappointment.  *update* The color of the decals went back to black and grey. I was using it at work (during some down time lol don't judge) and the color wasn't Brown and purple. When I got home, I took out my ds again and it was looking purple again. I don't know how cheap or type of vinyl and printing method that was used but whatever it was, it's temperature sensitive or light sensitive. One star still cause I'd like for it to stay the color that it was intended to be.	2015-08-21

Work great, and with plenty of cool features, like bass, speech, and nature sounds boosts. Finding a good pair of truly wireless and affordable headsets was a pain in the ass, but here they are. The battery isn't anything to be amazing, but nothing to scoff at either, they last about eight hours. They don't loose a charge either. I had charged them up and hadn't needed them for about a month or two, and they were still fully charged when I next used them. The distance is good, too. The farthest I've gone with them on is about eight to ten feet away from the transmitter, and they still come through, not like crystal, more like a radio signal.	2015-08-21

It is made of plastic, but it is not flimsy at all. The fans are quiet compared to other cooling fans I have used for previous consoles. I also like the feature that you can turn the fans on or off. It charges the controllers well, but they only charge if the console is on or on standby like normal. The stand has 3 additional USB ports in the front. This is a vertical stand, but I found a way to use the stand horizontally. I didn't have room to stand it vertically, so I used a small piece of wood to keep the other side level with the stand. The controllers are still easily accessed to charge when it is horizontal and the fans still work perfectly. When you put down a lot of money on something, you want to take care of it so you have no issues with it in the future. I had problems with my PS3 overheating as I had one of the first ones that was made. I didn't buy a fan for it and ended up having to buy a new PS3 after it pretty much blew up. I've learned from that and have been getting cooling fans for all my consoles. Now with this fan for the PS4, it doesn't even get warm to the touch. Definitely a good investment.<br /><br />I received this product free for my unbiased and honest opinion. I personally tested this product myself, and this is my honest opinion.	2015-08-21

This game is something different in a good way, its main focus isn't stealing cars or stealth like other games. Its main focus is about hacking computers pedestrian's cell phones and security cameras to find clues. while you find out who is responsible for killing the main characters niece. Graphics are passable, I've seen better; I've seen worst. Game play is good besides the glitches that happen out of nowhere with out any signs on how they happen. There are times when i'm running from police in this game and i walk up to a car to boost and the character freezes and just stands there i get move, shoot or nothing. everything around the character still moves, people cars etc. and there are times when the whole game freeze.

US	27453691	R17CWGT8O5146X	B00WTI3JPE	82806212	The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt	Video Games	3	0	2	N	N	Just..Okay.	"Ian B. Cooper's review hit the nail on the head. Don't let the size of this game fool you into thinking that it's amazing. I am half way through the game and I am having hard time not turning off my Playstation 4 because it is literally a series of \\\"fetch quests.\\\\\" The game is filled with glitches such as being unable to break an enemy's guard, even though they can break through yours, falling randomly (for no reason), enemies that literally disappear after you kill them so you can't loot them.<br /><br />That being said, the loot sucks in this game. You get very little experience for all the work you put in. The combat seems to work only when it wants to. I have fought over a hundred battle and it will move the character models to match the movement that the game engine is trying to convey to the world. The open world is huge but.... it's just okay. When I first turned it on and looked at it my thought was, \\\\\"So this is the world? Hmm, alright then.\\\\\"<br /><br />The voice over is pretty fantastic but most characters have nothing useful to say! I appreciate the content but couldn't the dev's put more money into making the game actually good? I think CD Projekt Red really want to drag out the story so there is so much useless s*** and dialogue in the game. *Meet character, get something for said character, meet elsewhere to talk (even though they could talk FINE where they are), retrieve worthless quest item, hope for ending of quest, repeat another 2 times and receive only 80 experience. And 80 EXP is pretty generous in most cases of the game.<br /><br />I really want to care about this world however with so many bad gameplay mechanics, i.e. Combat *that literally takes the game forward* it's hard to care about it. I can't bring myself to give this game more than a 3 out of 5. I think that's being nice too."	2015-08-21

With all the technical issues (framerate, graphical glitches, etc.), you just don’t expect to pay $60 (or over $100 if you purchased the special limited edition like me and/or the DLC) for a game that is not finished out the box.  I played the game the day of release and post patch, so I have a good sense of comparing both sides of the AC:U (pre and post patches).<br />All that being said, I did want to be fair to the developers and give Assassin’s Creed Unity another chance post all the updated patches and state in my opinion if it’s worth your hard-earned dollars.<br /><br />Graphics<br />I have to say that Assassin’s Creed Unity is a good looking game and the City of Paris truly comes to life and was a joy to explore.  A vast majority of the graphical glitches have been fixed; however, you’ll need to load a patch of about 8GB before being able to play.  It corrects most of the framerate issues (there are still some, but not nearly as bad) along with some of the clipping issues that was so pervasive pre-patch, but honestly, with a world this large, I kind of expect some graphical issues.  Again, this is a good looking game!<br /><br />Playability<br />As far as the playability, I felt Unity was a fun game overall.  There are times when Arno would have a mind of his own and take paths that would make me frustrated, but I’ve found that to be the case in most Assassin’s Creed games.  I did enjoy the new “parkour” system of being able to quickly scale a building and the same with descending from a rooftop.  You can do it at the touch of a button and I felt it was a really neat addition for the franchise.  Combat was also overhauled and is much different than any previous AC games.  Gone are the days when you can take on thirty enemies by yourself.  You really need to think about each and every encounter and where some were frustrated by this, I found the challenge and different approach strategic and fun!<br /><br />Story<br />On the story, this is such a subjective subject that I won’t really comment all that much here other than to say that I enjoyed the story.  I think the romance part of it between Arno and Elise was great and was the star of the game.  I wished at times that I could play as Elise, so I’m glad that with the upcoming AC: Syndicate, you can play as Evie.  It’s not the best AC story ever, but I thought Arno got a “bad rap” from some who wanted something different.  Again, I was satisfied with the story but do look forward to getting back to more of the AC Lore with upcoming iterations of AC.<br /><br />Multiplayer<br />There is also the cooperative multiplayer component that I found to be quite fun.  However, I found that if I was paired with players who didn’t share my playstyle (stealth vs. fast, heavy-duty combat), it made it somewhat difficult to accomplish the quest.  This is really true of any experience dealing with multiplayer, but I found it even more so in AC:U.<br /><br />Companion App (Update)<br />When the game was first released, Ubisoft had a companion app that linked with AC:U and players were only able to access certain chests throughout the game by completing activities in the app.  Notice that everything I’m saying here is in the past tense in that the companion app is no more and that’s a GREAT thing!  All these chest and content associated with the companion app is now available without ever accessing the app and again, in my humble opinion, this is a great thing.  I think you can download and use the app, but you’re not missing anything!<br /><br />Bottom Line<br />In my opinion, I would give AC:U a thumbs up and I think is worthy of a purchase, especially being it’s significantly cheaper.	2015-08-21

If you've played any fire emblem games or turn-based strategy, then this is as good as they come.

Every button the controller is stiff, the usb cord is at the most 4ft long, L and R have no analogue (no varying degrees in pressure sensing), the plastic overall feels like its from the dollar store, c-stick is buggy and inconsistent, and finally (the cherry on top that brought me to writing this review)... the hardware is utter trash that WILL break eventually no matter how gentle you handle it.<br /><br />With that said, I was sapped into buying this twice. First time I bought it, it broke within the first couple months. But I figured the reason for that was because I was letting friends use it whenever we'd play. So oh well, not much to be done there other than buy another and keep the controller exclusive to myself. So its on sale and I decide to buy it again. This time I make sure to use it very sparingly, but still it just ends up broken.<br />Now when I say broken I don't mean the controller snapped in half or the buttons break. The hardware inside the controller just dies. It becomes &#34;unrecognizable&#34; whenever I plug it into my computer. Both times that's how the controllers broke. It was gradual as well. I would sometimes get it become recognizable again by fiddling around with the orientation of the cord but eventually that doesn't do the job anymore.<br /><br />So all in all, if you want a GURANTEED TO BE TEMPORARY controller then by all means, buy this. Otherwise look into buying an adapter.<br /><br />There is a 4 port one that doubles as a PC and WiiU GC adapter. While I don't currently own it, I have tried a friend's. It was only for a few hours so I can't vouch for how durable it is in the long run. But thats what I'm going to buy next.	2015-08-21

This is the best purchase I've made for my PS4 yet. Once you open the packaging, you're instantly satisfied with the amount of extra USB ports available to you. The fans provide a huge relief, especially if the area your PS4 is in is confined and lacks airflow. Having both controllers always charged and ready is such a great advantage on its own; adding the vertical stand with docks and cooling fans is a huge plus. The sound emitted from this product isn't too loud. It's what any desktop PC or DLP TV would sound like and it isn't invasive at all. The PS4 does just simply sit in the stand and isn't secured on either side, but I haven't found this to be an issue. It's very sturdy and looks amazing as well. After making the investment into your console, this product is a bargain for the features you gain.	2015-08-21

Now Geralt embarks on his most personal quest to get tangled in furniture while picking flowers and running errands for local peasants.&#34;<br /><br />Maybe that's a bit harsh, but I really feel that's what the game's tagline might be if there was any truth in advertising. Not sure how so many people have been fooled by this game's hype, but I'm guessing a lot of the fans are fans simply because they don't want to feel like they spent this much money on a lemon.<br /><br />I must admit, I fell for the hype, and I tried, but I'm just not enjoying it, and I can't lie to myself and pretend it's a good game.<br /><br />On the positive side, the graphics and the visuals are very pretty, so pretty in fact, that I was kinda blinded by them. After playing so many games that made me feel cold, wet and uncomfortable (Skyrim, I'm talking about you), I just wanted so much to spend some time in a warm welcoming environment. The visuals of this game held that promise.<br /><br />Unfortunately, graphics aren't everything. If they were, this game would deserve all its hype. However, in terms of gameplay, too many of the missions are tedious, the controls and combat are often frustrating, and I find the cutscenes are too many and too boring, and when I try to skip them, it doesn't skip to the end of the scene, nor does it skip to the next decision within the scene - instead it skips about 5 seconds ahead during the SAME cutscene, so I'm hitting &#34;skip&#34; 5 to 10 times during the same scene. Silly choices like this on the part of the developers appear throughout the game, and they make me think this game was rushed out of the door to meet some arbitrary deadline. On the other hand, they must have spent months creating an endless stream of &#34;go fetch&#34; missions, so they had time - they just spent it on the wrong things. I'm beginning to think it would be a better game if I could just remove all the missions and all the combat and just wander around in the beautiful world they've created. On the other hand, I'd still be clunkily bumping into things, getting stuck in doorways and (for some reason) leaping down stairs instead of just walking down them like a normal person would. Maybe the mutations that witchers go through make them incapable of moving normally.<br /><br />Also, it seems the developers of this game have become addicted to motion capture - half the game is boring mo-cap cutscenes and the other half is spent doing lame collection missions for peasants. If I wanted the former, I'd watch a movie; if I wanted the latter, I could get a job in the real world. Where is the compelling story of a world changed by my actions? Where is the epic that a game like this should bring? Skyrim, for all its flaws, at least had those things. The Witcher: Wild Hunt does not.<br /><br />I've been playing videogames for 35 years, and I would have thought that, by 2015, all games developers would have at least figured out how to make game characters move competently. Heck, GTA V and Assassin's Creed pretty much get it right. Surely by now it's not all that difficult for folks who actually do this stuff for a living to make game characters able to move around architecture, furniture and people with some grace. Geralt may be a great swordsman when faced by any kind of monster, but it seems that when he's facing a door, a fence or a flight of stairs, he's in serious trouble. Others may be able to get past this, but I can't - not when there are other games that do movement far better.<br /><br />The game has some potential - it could have been great, but I feel the developers dropped the ball in terms of giving players what we've come to expect from a top-tier title. This game needs some serious work on the basics - it seems the folks behind CD Projekt Red are just not ready for the big leagues.game if I could just remove all the missions and all the combat and just wander around in the beautiful world they've created.

I spent a solid half hour in the settings just tuning everything, especially the controls as you can assign controls for everything (I recommend, if you drive full manual, set left trigger to the clutch instead of brake. It's intuitive - I have left analog stick down as brake) also, the more powerful your car is, the more likely you are to spin out if you accelerate as fast as you can recklessly - you truly have to learn how to tame the cars. Everything's unlocked initially but you'll find yourself working up to the powerhouse vehicles anyways. Wonderfully and beautifully done game.	2015-08-21

I bought this system from a friend I work with. I like it. I love the excellent graphics. Although I like this system I have to say I DO NOT like the automatic updates that you have to sit through for several hours before you can play your game. If you're connected to the internet and you've got a game disc in your console that you want to play, you're screwed. Due to the automatic updating it takes forever to install your game. I found a work-around to avoid the updates though. All else works fine. If you buy this system just keep in mind NOT to connect your console to the internet while installing then playing your games. The only things you need to do on the internet is update your console and set up an account and that's it. I hope this review is helpful.	2015-08-21

I have quite large hands, but am still able to use it for very long play sessions with only occasional discomfort.<br /><br />Second, this is not a &#34;Premium&#34; controller. The D-Pad leaves much to be desired, the L2 and R2 triggers have a weird travel range and an annoyingly high sensitivity, the analog sticks are unclickable (L3 and R3) when the joysticks are anything but dead center (not an issue in the games I play, but I can imagine when playing an FPS, ducking or sprinting becomes impossible), and the buttons &#34;soften&#34; noticeably after several hours of use.<br /><br />With all that being said though, I love this controller. The smart clip grips my Samsung Galaxy S4 in an Otterbox Defender Case securely (except when I try to play in bed with the device near inverted... but I should probably stop playing in bed and just go to sleep anyway) and it has EXCEPTIONAL battery life. The ability to also charge your phone from the controller is also a nice touch, but I rarely use that feature. With the Moga Pivot app the controller pairs in moments and most of my apps natively recognize the controller, allowing for configuration-free play in many cases.<br /><br />tl;dr: A handful of issues keep this &#34;good&#34; controller from being &#34;great&#34; but I would definitely recommend it for those looking for a relatively inexpensive Android gaming solution.	2015-08-21

It has plenty of game play and plenty of things to do. I love the mixture of being an assassin and a pirate. You can sink boats, free slaves, fish for whales, find treasure, assassinate people, and so on. It's very fun. BUT.. the one big problem I have with the game is command glitches. There's so much you can do in the game and it seems like the wires get crossed in the process. Climbing and hiding in a hurry can be problematic because of your character messing up or getting stuck. It's very, very frustrating. The game is very fun, but I don't understand how a game this new can have so many problems when it comes to getting your character to do what you want when you want him to. It's worse than the first Infamous's few and far between glitches while climbing, which is even more sad cuz that game was made years ago. I would almost take two stars of because it is so frustrating but, all in all it is a good game	2015-08-21

Basically a great way to pollute the earth with more plastic since it does not function correctly. First problem is the triggers don't reach the B button. Kinda defeats the entire purpose of the item when you CANT SHOOT ANYTHING! So I had to ghetto rig it with super glue and pencil erasers to make it work. Second big problem is there is a chamber to put your excess cord but there is not way to shut the compartment! They don't have anywhere in the design to allow the nun chuck connection out of it when it is closed so why include it at all? Also, the wii remote is not held in place by anything so it just falls out randomly while playing unless secured with rubber bands. We tried with third party and first party controllers for everything we encounter problems with. So basically this does nothing it is supposed to without serious modifications. Just buy the Nintendo branded ones and don't waste your time with these.	2015-08-21

Mass Effect combines combat and role playing perfectly in an action-packed, story- and character-driven video game. This quickly became my favorite trilogy after my brother introduced it to me a couple of years ago. I became an instant fan of the characters. You suffer through genuine heartbreak when each game ends, and the loss of your favorites never goes without mourning. (Seriously. Ask any Mass Effect fan how the third game affected them emotionally.) You can customize Commander Shepard, which makes him/her highly personal to your tastes as to what a hero (or perhaps anti-hero, depending on what choices you make) truly is. There are plenty of opportunities for romance lines throughout the game, and this is where my only complaint comes in.<br /><br />The third game is the only game in the trilogy in which there are same sex male couples -- and even then, you have a choice of two male characters if you play a male Shepard. The first, second and third games welcome same sex couples for a female Shepard, however. Romance isn't what makes the story, though -- and you even have the opportunity to not engage in a romantic relationship at all. But it's definitely a nice edition, so why wouldn't you?<br /><br />The characters all have unique personalities. The species are all so in-depth that you can study their cultures online, or even in-game if you choose to take the time to do so. The world is open-ended, beautiful, and so expansive that you'll have no choice but to consider (and hope for there being) life beyond Earth.	2015-08-21

Arrived in a completely busted case.  It's one thing to need a generic case for a used game, but there are cheap cases out there that at least are the proper shape & color to fit in with other Xbox 360 game cases.

I figured/hoped that this reduction was because of slow WiiU sales and not a reflection of the quality of this headset. It has the &#34;Official Nintendo Seal of Approval&#34; on the box after all, and Turtle Beach isn't a no-name brand.<br /><br />Headset is very flimsy and seems like it would break before getting much use. Padding for ears is too light, I can feel the hard plastic underneath jamming on my ears. Would probably hurt if I actually wanted to keep using them...which I don't.<br /><br />Which leads me to my biggest gripe: The sound this headset puts out is FARA too low. Even with the volume on the set and the volume on the tablet both set to max, I can barely hear it. It's about as loud as standing ~20 feet from someone playing on a 3DS if they set their sound to half volume.<br /><br />It is so ridiculous that I pulled out a cheap pair of Sennheisers that I bought from Amazon back in 2008 that were broken within a month of using them. The left cup will intermittently drop sound. These are still VASTLY superior to the brand new Turtle Beach headset.<br /><br />The price is so cheap that I won't bother to send it back to Amazon. They have been really good to me over the years. Honestly, I am just going to throw them in the garbage and be done with them.	2015-08-21

Super satisfied with this order. Came quite fast. It came with two battery packs as shown, and it's great material. I was surprised at how good it was, especially for the price. At first, I was scared the battery pack wouldn't fit in my white XBOX 360 controller that came with the console, but when I slipped it in, it was a perfect match! The battery doesn't take long for it to charge--there's a screen at the front of the charger that lights up red or green when it's still charging or is done. When it's all charged, the charger actually turns off (and so does the screen), so you don't have to worry about over charging it. So far, I only have one controller to stick it in the charger, so it looks kind of weird to have an open slot, but that's nothing much to worry about (because I'm going to order another controller anyway). Overall, I'm truly happy to get this! Don't have to waste money on constantly buying regular double A batteries anymore!	2015-08-21

Bon fires (aka save points) are closer to bosses, the combat is more fluid, shops are conveniently placed in a town, and the dodge is more responsive/accurate.

Realistic.  It does have an arcade mode but it is at its best as a sim racer.  I have a wheel setup but I also bought the wheel accessory to use with motion sensor steering. I have always been terrible at racing games with the controller.  It is a wonderful addition to the game and only took a few races to get used to it.  You can use the motion controls with the DS4 as it is, just choose motion steering in the options and turn/tilt the controller left/right.  But the stock settings are too sensitive, in my opinion, so these are my settings in case anyone wants to try them:<br />1. Options & help menu<br />2. Controls<br />3. Choose wireless controller motion sensor<br />4. Press R1 to go to configuration screen<br />5. My current settings:<br />Controller input mode - 2 (scroll down its the 2nd to the bottom on the list).<br />Deadzone -  0<br />Steering sensitivity - 25<br />Throttle/brake dead zone and sensitivity all set at - 5<br />Clutch deadzone - 13<br />Clutch sensitivity - 45<br />Speed sensitivity - 0<br />Controller sensitivity - 30<br />Force feedback - 100<br />Rpm display - yes<br />Advanced - off<br /><br />Also here is a good site for setups - http://projectcarssetups.eu/#/bycar<br />I recommend the game as a sim racer and the wheel accessory.	2015-08-21

Love these! I'm a firm believer in original look and feel - I believe there's a reason the manufacturers made it the way they did. But when I saw these, I decided I had to give skins a shot - and am so glad I did. Unlike other skins, these don't cover the controller completely - they cover the back and the handgrips and it just looks awesome. Fully recommend for functionality as well - analog sticks feel and grip great and so do the handgrips - overall excellent product.	2015-08-21

What to do?	This is not a good game and it definitely isn't worth thirty bucks. If it was ten schmucks, it might be a two star game. It doesn't make the game any better if it's cheaper--it just seems like an offense to charge so much for this crap! There are just so many better 3DS games, that this is a waste of your time!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-the visuals are ok<br />-didn't lock up on me at all...<br />-no save game bugs...<br />-did not cause nuclear war!<br />-better than &#34;Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&#34;<br /><br />Cons:<br />-very little variety. There are sixteen tracks and 3 or 4 of them are very similar desert tracks.<br />-only sixteen tracks. (Mario Kart 7 has 32)<br />-no multiplayer. No local or online multiplayer<br />-all the drivers drive the same. The drivers look different but they all drive the same<br />-All the carts drive like tanks--tanks on ice. It would make an AWESOME ice capades experience, but not so great 3ds kart game.<br />-too expensive<br />-I didn't have any fun playing it and my kids weren't interested (doesn't help that they don't know who Garfield is)<br /><br />There's an awesome racing game on the 3ds. It's called Mario Kart 7. There are lots of mediocre racing games on the 3ds. Some of them are just poor games, some have technical issues like poor frame rates. While not perfect, Ridge racer 3d is a pretty good game. Asphault for the 3DS isn't horrible. This Garfield Kart is beneath them all. It's one of the worst 3ds games I've played.	2015-08-21

They yellow lenses are better to reduce glare than clear ones ...<br /><br />However, as with other people I kept seeing a blur of a reflection in them, on slowly moving the glasses forward down my nose, it became apparent that its a reflection of light from my eyeballs on the inside of the glasses. once you notice it, you see it all the time... its now at the point that its causing eye strain...<br /><br />I will be putting mine on ebay, ive had them a week and worn them 3 times at most, its a shame as they do filter the glare.	2015-08-21

I will start out by saying that this review is based solely on the actual game card and not the gameplay itself.  Idea Factory has an issue with this game being defective. I did not purchase it here but at Best Buy; after doing research all stores have been affected by defective game carts. The PS Vita will simply not read the card. You can reboot your system, put in the card again and again but it wil not recognize it whatsoever.  Not all of the cards are defective of course, but Gamestop, BBuy, Amazon and Target all have had defective bunches of this game out in the market. For now, I would highly suggest holding off on purchasing this game from anywhere unless you can test it in the store. I had a heck of a time exchanging/returning it simply because it was opened and they don't even carry the physical copy in my area at BBuy.  Also, the price point here is crazy for a physical game that may be defective. Amazon has a great return policy but why take the chance and why pay so much more. My advice if you must have it now, purchase it digitally and save yourself the hassle and money.. or go into a local store that has copies, take your Vita and do the purchase/opening there.  I love the Hyperdimension games but hardly any news of how this problem is being handled is disappointing to say the least. I will update my review with further updates and when I have had a chance to play it. For now, IF seems to be quiet on the issue.  ***** Update *****  Bought another copy and it did the same thing. Didn't work. Waiting for a bit before purchasing another copy from somewhere else.	2015-08-21

The game is too long and cumbersome.  There's too many items to collect and mix.  I feel like I need to be some sort of wizard to play it.  Controls also do not feel good.  Character moves too loosely, yet can't even jump over some fences.  While I'm aware this game is not AC, this game's controls could have used a little touch of that.<br /><br />Right off the bat you will see this game has lots of dialogue and cutscenes.  The good thing is you can choose what to say, but there's too much of this.  It feels like a drag.  The game also freezes a lot on the loading screen which adds more to the slow pacing.  My only fix is to suspend it and hope it finally works when I open again or just close it completely.  Keep in mind that every time you start up the game, there is an unskippable cutscene that loads it up.  This is normal for games, but becomes more waiting for this game.<br /><br />In the end, I just felt it wasn't worth my time to invest in.  Normally I do like to immerse myself in games, learn its intricacies and spend countless hours on it, but the game has to grab me from the start.  I was hoping it'd be another Red Dead Redemption, but unlike that game,  it lacked decent flow with good controls.  Performance issues aside, this is where the game failed in my opinion.  The character also lacks emotion to seem interesting.  What has the making to be a great game might not have the right design if you share similar feelings.	2015-08-21

The mic is absolutely atrocious.  At first, I thought it was because of the noise cancelling as it is the summer and I have my AC blasting in the house.  After I would turn the AC off my friends would report that I sounded better.  After I've used these for close to a month now, the mic issue is a real problem and I basically have to shout into it in order to be heard.  I bought noise cancelling headphones in order to not bother others in the house however, I can't do so if I have to shout at my friends.  Not even worth the $100 I spent.  If you are just looking for headphones, then by all means go ahead and purchase.  If you are looking for wireless and you're louder than a bullhorn on a normal day, then go ahead and purchase.  If you're a normal person looking to keep the noise down while gaming, spend the extra money on better headphones.	2015-08-21

In my case I am running windows 8.1 on a Dell XPS pc and despite appearing to install it does not work.  When I run it I can hear music but there video produces a black screen.  Hitting escape or activating the task manager (control, alt, delete at the same time) stops the music but also freezes my computer requiring a restart.  I have tried it multiple times -- no luck.  In fact when I went to delete the program it did not appear in the list of programs that can be removed.  You can find this problem on the internet reported by others but no easy answers are provided (world of goo music but no video)  The bottom line - I can't use it and there does not appear to be a solution to the problem I can find.	2015-08-21

There are so many side missions it was mind boggling - although there is some repitition and some not all that interesting. For the most part I was enjoying the game. Then I upgraded to Windows 10. Now ACU only runs for about 10 minutes then crashes. I'm playing with some settings and compatibility modes that may help. I haven't had a single issue with any other game or application. I'll update if I find a way around the issue if not I'll just dump the game.	2015-08-21

Initially this was a great mouse, however i've only used it for more than a year and its seen its age. As a &#34;mature gamer&#34; I'm not as rough on my gear like my younger siblings, but I thought this would last as long as my trusty logitech mice. Bought it in April of 2014, and I'm just now retiring it 1.5 yrs of service?<br /><br />Some issues, in the past the mouse cursor will only slew diagonally across the screen even though I'm performing only up and down motions. Happened about once or twice a gaming session, now it happens at least everytime. Odd. DPI settings and resets did not fix. Next, the scroll wheel is no longer scrolling or middle clicking. Physical issue, probably something I can fix if I open it up<br /><br />I know I'd have to take it apart, but I need a mouse with more buttons anyway, so I'll try another offering here on Amazon.	2015-08-21

As a longtime fan of the series I was a little worried when I heard they were gonna change the mechanics up with less gravity and a constantly decreasing O2 meter. Luckily Gearbox did it perfectly as usual, and brought an interesting shade of grey to a lot of the &#34;Bad Guys&#34;. The Guns are awesome, the maps are all different and have interesting little easter eggs hidden all over. I am currently on my fourth playthrough and I am still not bored of it, so give this one a try.	2015-08-21

When I first saw the game, I was completely excited, because the show was fun and interesting to watch. So, buying the game was my #1 choice for my Wii console. The game seemed cool at first, but after a few plays from time to time, I've realized how weak the controls, the animation, and game play are. For instance, most rounds that you play in this game seem to be set up for you to lose, and most of the rounds are indeed difficult. The &#34;easy,&#34; &#34;challenging,&#34; and &#34;extreme&#34; choices all seem the same.<br /><br />For the Wipeout Big Ball round, when you're playing against the computer players, they are more likely to jump over them all. However, when you're playing, you can barely jump on one. Another disadvantage of this game is the controls - the controls are very weak and using the nunchuk barely helps at all. When you are out for a round, you are allowed to throw balls at the other contestants in order to push them down easier. At most points, however, you are prevented from doing so EVEN if the game directly tells you to click B to throw balls at the contestants or the targets.<br /><br />The animation is very irritating as well. I like the similarities to the show, but the way the hosts talk, including John Henson and Jill Wagner, the animations are horrible, and the voice acting is repetitive as well. The choice of the characters for the challenges are interesting and unique, but their speed and capability in the game needed much more improvement.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good game to play with the family; however, if you're playing by yourself against a few computer players, prepare to feel frustrated with the game's set up.	2015-08-21

You need to flip the bottom screen in the setup so the high &#34;E&#34; is on the top line (String) on the screen or you'll never be able to use TAB once you start to learn the guitar. The default has the low &#34;E&#34; as the top string and this can seem to be helpful at first but it will really throw you off then you start to use TAB books.	2015-08-21

After several months of play, I can confidently say that I made the right purchase.  The controller is comfortable and ergonomic, and my fingers rest comfortably on the shoulder and trigger buttons.  The battery life is advertised at around 40 hours, and I've found that to be the case, more or less.  The button resistance is satisfying, the thumbsticks feel tight and responsive, and it feels solid and sturdy overall.  My palms do get a little sweaty during extended gaming sessions, but I'm a sweaty guy to begin with, and I tend to grip the controller like it's trying to escape, so that's probably just me.<br /><br />Be aware, you will need a Microsoft Wireless PC Gaming Receiver in order to use this controller with a PC or Steam Box.  This specific controller didn't come with one, but it was easy enough to find one on sale.  That having been said, this controller gets a solid recommendation from me.	2015-08-21

I Like the domed shaped medium height ones but the longer ones may work if you only use one but if your using 2 the one on the right side of the controller might be too tall for most FPS as it takes a while to move from right stick to buttons. These are just opinions from my personal experiences but try one and see which works best for you.<br /><br />Thanks Foamy Lizard for a great product.	2015-08-21

One note is that the buttons to adjust mute, volume, etc., is that they do not have clear tactile cues...hard to tell which buttons just by touching them...so until you use them a while and remember their placement, you might find yourself taking them off to look at the button markings.

Recently my two year old daughter got a hold of the disk and rendered it useless. No problem I though, Ill go down to Gamestop tomorrow and pick one up for dirt cheap right? After all the game is ancient, and it was never that popular even when it was first issued. To my surprise there was only one used copy of the game in my entire county and they wanted $60 for it. Hell no! So then I looked to Amazon and I find they want $90 for a new copy. Hell no! Well I settled on a pre-owned copy from an Amazon seller for around $40. Why am I telling you all of this? Because there is no other game that I would jump through hoops for and end up spending more money on it today than I did when it first came out 2 1/2 years ago. Yes I love this game, and I have wasted hundreds of hours becoming the greatest pitcher baseball has ever known. It is after all the only video game I still play.	2015-08-21

Only complaint is in the beginning you meet up with Major Stede Bonnet and share a few adventures, and then he completely vanishes.  His public hanging in December 1718 in Charleston, SC<br />(only a month after Blackbeard was shot by Lt. Robert Maynard) is not included in the game.  There should be an update to correct this oversight.  Another suggestion would be as you play the game you should be reading A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson (or DeFoe?) published in 1724.  It makes the game even more enjoyable.  The use of the lithographs from this book are obviously used to create the full colored characters that you will encounter in the game.  All-in-all a job well done by UBI Soft.	2015-08-21

Not a whole lot to say on this one. It fits the PS4 well, but It also doesn’t have a very wide base, so I don’t know if I’d trust it 100%. Storing the PS4 vertically is nice, it saves some horizontal room, but if there's a lot of traffic where you’ve got your consoles plugged in, all it would take is one good bump to knock it over. If it was a tad wider, and maybe clipped on to the PS4 in some capacity, it would be grade A, but as of now, it’s a decent, standard vertical stand. You could do worse. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.	2015-08-21

I haven't gotten to far into the game yet but I gotta say so far I'm absolutely loving it it reminds almost of banjo kazooie with a Chinese/Asian feel it is a straight up old school 3D platformer and it is quite refreshing to go back to that style of game especially on the new consoles the game looks great the updated graphics are very colorful and I absolutely love the music the Chinese plucked guitar sound ( don't know what they call the instrument) is soo awesome All and all if your a fan of old school 3d platformers then this is the game for you highly recommend	2015-08-21

This game has managed to take a fun and interesting series and utterly ruin it. NOT FUN AT ALL! I can't believe that anyone makes it to where this dog of a game supposedly gets good, and I find it hard to believe that  it ever does! This game is absolutely horrible. I understand that people griped about Dragon Age 2, but that game was fun from start to finish.<br /><br />This character,, Maxwell House? He's a cardboard, one dimensional character with less personality than Mario. The role playing in this series is but a shadow of the previous games, combat is unimpressive, and why, for the love of God, can you not import your game settings when you're playing all three on the same console??? Why force players to go through a cumbersome online experience from their computer? What? You couldn't pay Dark Horse to do an intro comic like you did for Mass Effect?<br /><br />I loved the first two games and was really psyched to play this one. Biggest disappointment ever! Avoid this game at all costs, and keep your money. It is not worth it, unless you want an expensive coaster.	2015-08-21

I'm no audiophile, but using these after having my V-moda XS's I haven't had a problem with audio quality.<br /><br />This thing is awesome. It's very comfy, and the material won't let your head get too hot from long sessions.<br /><br />I have my xbone and PC on the same desk, and it connects to both wirelessly at the same time (however does need to connect to xbox controller if you want to chat, the only downside)<br /><br />The connections are simple. You run the optical from your xbox, and run the USB power from your PC, which you also use for a microphone, and run a 3.5mm line from your pc to the transmitter for audio. 3 cables and you're completely done setting this thing up. Plug in the short USB cable to the back of the transmitter to charge it when it's on the stand not in use. I'd recommend picking up a 6 foot amazon basics micro-usb cable so if it runs out of juice while you're playing you can plug it in and keep going. You will have to shave off some excess plastic on the micro-usb side though, just use a file or a mini-saw on a multitool. Just don't forget to update your headset and your xbox one controllers!<br /><br />Anyways, onto audio.<br />I wanted surround on my PC and my Xbox, and this thing wirelessly delivers. With the aforementioned 3.5mm jack from pc to transmitter above, and setting it up as a surround connection with your audio devices manager, it sounds great. It delivers the sound I want from playing Battlefield on PC or Halo/Forza on my Xbox, big bass with nice clarity on the highs. You can use the other 2 pre-sets, 'core' and 'gaming' or whatever, but I just prefer the first one, 'media'. The other two artificially boost the mids and highs too much imo. Be sure to fine tune these even more on PC using your audio eq settings.<br />The mic is passable. It's nowhere near the best, but it doesn't bother my friends on skype, even when I just downgraded from the great V-moda Boom Mic. You can find a lot of mic samples with a quick youtube search.<br /><br />There's not much more to say here. It wirelessly connects to my xbox and pc, sounds great on both, I can nearly walk across my entire smaller sized house (20-25 feet) without audio cutting out, it's very comfy for extended periods, and it just works. If it doesn't feel like it's fitting you well, try making the headband smaller, for my average sized head I made it go down 2.5 blocks on the headband.<br /><br />The price on these may be steep, so just be a smart shopper. Look for used Amazon Warehouse deals specifically, I bought mine in 'very good' condition for 200, and the box's seals weren't even broken! 100 dollars off for nothing wrong! Sign up for amazon cards, get the giftcards and make sure you don't use them to pay when checking out since they are made default payment options. Be a smart shopper, and enjoy the best Xbox/PC wireless setup you can buy!<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />With the release of Windows 10, you can join and create parties within the Xbox App on your PC. So, if you plan on gaming with a party, you can have fully wireless chat and game at the same time! Just have your PC setup like above, and start the party. You can listen to both your PC and your Xbox at the same time, so that also fixes the music snapping issue completely!a lot of mic samples with a quick youtube search.<br /><br />There's not much more to say here.

If you really love the Arkham series games you will like it I suppose but it's just more of the same. This game feels a lot more linear to me than the other titles in the series. Also a lot more puzzle based which isn't really my thing. The thing I like about the Arkham games is flapping around Gotham as the caped crusader, spotting a gang of thugs down on the street and then swooping down and dishing out a platter of bat-justice. But for me this game just didn't have enough of that.<br /><br />Also the surprise attack feature makes things way to easy.you can surprise attack and enemy and then chain surprise attack the entire group one goon at a time with only the push of a single button. It makes your feel super powerful but it's neither challenging or fun.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I wanted this game to be good. I traded  in three older games to get this one but it's just meh. It looks amazing and the batmobile battles are some of the best funnest to have in the game but I was hoping for a leap forward from the last title in the series and it just wasn't there.	2015-08-21

Their ads lead you to believe that there's an open-world with different classes to choose from. However those ads are almost lies. The game is short without paying an extra $60 for the DLC, the multiplayer is a halo clone, and the &#34;open-world&#34; is made up of separated areas with invisible walls everywhere and a pretty sky-box.<br />  I've played this game for over 200hrs and had very little fun. Since, I've picked up Elder Scrolls Online which is a much more comprehensive MMO with an actual open-world, and a lot more activities in said open-world.<br />  The classes are Enforcer (supposed to be a tank hence the armor) which ends up being a support class. Hunter (the rouge) It's as advertised. Last but not least is warlock (wizard,sorcerer), this one is the tank/dps/everything so its basically OP. This is confirmed by even bungie, there is a challange for one of the legendary weapons in the game that allocates points to kills on specific classes, the warlock is worth 5 more points than the other classes.<br />  In the first-person shooter aspect it's a re-skinned halo. I've played a lot of halo as well. Basic kill is a few shots due to shields, It's very formulaic<br />  Save yourself the wasted time and buy something else. Do not support this kind of game development.	2015-08-21

I bought my set back in november 2013 and they're starting to wear out. By that, I mean the wire has started to separate at the base of the earphone on the left side, which infrequently causes the left audio feed to cut out. I'm also not fond of the uncomfortable textured material on the earcups and the tough foam inserts exacerbate the issue, It's like I'm wearing sharks on my ears.<br /><br />One thing to note, while you CAN connect these to your PC (Plug the USB plug into a free USB port and the green-ended cord jacks into one of the green ports on the back of your machine), the handy volume slider on the attached control box doesn't work when connected to the PC (because reasons... seriously, I don't see why it shouldn't work)<br /><br />Overall, if you need a cheap headset and don't mind having to replace them in a year after neglectfully leaving them wherever, these might be for you (if you don't mind minor discomfort) I don't think I will, though.	2015-08-21

Super fun, and I love how it detects your clothes color to determine the colors your character would be wearing. Had no technical trouble with it, and feel super satisfied with this order! Could be hard when it comes to controlling your character when it comes to turning a certain direction or so, but that's pretty much about it. I like how you can play up to four players, though you're not accomplishing the levels together--you're accomplishing the levels separately in 4 screens, if you know what I mean. What I don't really like is once one player finishes the level, the level is automatically done, and the players who aren't even near the end of the level won't get the chance to finish it, if you know what I mean.  However, it really adds on to the competitiveness to try to accomplish the level. Overall, I am super satisfied with this! Cool game!	2015-08-21

It seems the angle allows it to slide in all the way so you can load the game. Numerous people returned their box and the replacement failed as well.  This seems to be a major problem that Microsoft hasn't initiated a fix for yet. Why should I return it for repair or replacement if I'm still likely going to experience the same issue.

A very different Final Fantasy than what we have become accustomed to, but still offers a fairly fun experience that may or may not to all RPG fans!! Diehard FF fans may not enjoy the game because it does &#34;venture&#34; into some newer territory as far as gameplay and what you are limited to do.<br /><br />STORY: The war ravaged land of Orience is a constant battleground for its inhabitants. The evil Militese Empire has its lands in the north and has raged war on the lands to the south of Rubrum all over the magical Crystals that embody the essence of each of the lands. Each region has their own Crystal (even Militese) and each one provides protection and power to each region. Militese Empire has become greedy and is looking to take over all the other Crystals and that's where you come in. For the first time ever in FF, you will be able to control one of 14 characters and fight off the Empire's cohorts. You will control one of the cadets of Class Zero, which is a training center of young recruits in Arkademia which is located in the heart of Rubrum. You will battle the Empire and look to conquer back your lands that the Empire has seized. All in all, the story is a little lacking as far as a Final Fantasy story should be. The game leaves a TON of questions unanswered and does a poor job of explaining much at all and sort of expects players to figure it out on their own. However, it is a tale of much pain and sorrow and can at times leave players feeling much grief. It is a violent and sad life the young citizens are thrust into and offers an ok experience. DOES NOT come close to other more epic FF titles as far as an epic story though. STORY 6/10.<br /><br />GRAPHICS- Game looks good and environments can be very pretty to look at times, although not what you would come to expect for a game with the PS4's capabilities. Characters who are talking don't at all look like they are speaking and the environments all pretty much look the same. The towns ALL look the same. While in combat  though, all the colors from casting spells and attacking are fun to see. GRAPHICS 6/10<br /><br />GAMEPLAY- Ok, FF Type 0 is fun. However, If you are looking for tons of new places to discover and lots of loot, then this may not be for you. You do at some point get the option to explore the world as you unlock more and more places as you progress in the main story. It is still limited though, as you progress through the story, the game provides you little time to do so. There are TONS of quests and TONS OF REPLAYABILITY however. When you finish Type 0, you have only just begun. NEW quests will become available and this one of the games best features. ALSO, there are different endings, so there is a lot of time that can be put into it. And, there is a codex system (reference location where you can look at bestiary, keep up with quests you have completed and more) which is called Crystarium, a great feature to FF Type O. Fun game but not ENTIRELY what you would come to expect for a FF title. GAMEPLAY 7/10<br /><br />BATTLE- The battle system is GREAT!! Best feature of the game and by far the fastest and fluent combat system we have seen YET! You can only control one character at a time in battle but can switch between 1 of 14 at any given time. And there is no pause in between. Its a swift and fun approach. You will be amazed at how fast the combat is, (especially if you are used to the old style FF games system) and you can die literally in seconds if you aren't careful. A great system that may not appeal to diehard fans! BATTLE 9/10<br /><br />OVERALL- Type 0 is a fun and fast paced game that offers a lot of replayability. Finish the game and start anew with new quests and new things to uncover. The mediocre story weighs it down and characters aren't the greatest of any FF game, but it is still a fun RPG adventure that I recommend any fan of FF try out!!.

I bought this for my brother's PS4 and he instantly fell in love with it. Both controllers are constantly at a full charge and if you ever have a guest over, you're ready to go! Another thing we love is if you play for a long time or leave your controller on accidentally, you always have one charged and ready. I first noticed how sleek it looked and nicely it was designed. It has nice curves but also has sharper features that compliment your console. The controllers fit nicely into the dock and the USB gently slides into the controller, giving you a quality feel and no damage to your equipment. One great thing that everyone instantly notices is the LED bar that continuously lines the entire outside of the unit. It provides a rich assortment of colors that fade into each other endlessly. This is displayed on top of a horizontally placed PS4 and is a must for any console owner. Keep in mind that in addition to all these great features, you'll also gain a USB port on your PS4 to utilize for anything else.	2015-08-21

People play it and they immediately get pulled in by the crazy story and quirky characters. Let me assure you, no one is attracted to this game because of the graphics, gameplay, or controls...they are terrible on every level. This is a very PS2-ish looking title, and the controls are the worst I've ever utilized. No, what people are attracted to is the Twin Peaks influence, although, they may or may not realize that fact.<br /><br />Twin Peaks was a TV show that made it's debut in 1990. The peculiar characters in Deadly Premonition are all borrowed from Twin Peaks, same with the story line. If you have a sense of humor at all, or are into the paranormal and macabre, you will find Twin Peaks very entertaining and original. I'm going out on a limb here, but when people fall in love with this game, what they're really doing is loving the off-beat, quirky styling of Twin Peaks. It's a shame because this cheap imitation will rob you of the experience of watching the show (if you play the game first). Deadly Premonition is not original in the slightest...it's weird and it's niche, I'll give it that.<br /><br />To sum it up, Deadly Premonition a miserably failed attempt at a Twin Peaks influenced horror game, but they Japanesed it up so much that the end result is unique. I do not recommend purchasing this game for anything more than $5. Save your money for a good Twin Peaks inspired game like Alan Wake and watch the show instead.	2015-08-21

Anyone intending to purchase this item, please read first! This decal game console sticker is only for the &#34;Slim&#34; Xbox 360! Not the Original or latest model! No where was I told of this and I own the original version! I had to improvise and cut out sections for the controller USB and memory slots (in my attempt to do so I broke the covering slot for the memory *is very annoyed*). Also, the larger pieces do not fit right on the front and back. They are wider, but longer, in which I had to cut the ends so the vent holes on the xbox wouldn't be covered! I did consider returning, but they are basically just stickers and I was able to get them to work for the most part. However the parts for the xbox controllers, those fit perfectly :P They look really nice and it's cool to play FF13 with my ff13 decal stickers.<br /><br />Other than the heads up for what versions and not making alternate for each versions, these decals are really cool!	2015-08-21

I still think it was a fun game and very ambitious for the time, but wow is it buggy.<br /><br />Choices you should have aren't really choices, because if you chose one way you run in to a unintended dead end and have to start over from the last save.<br /><br />I just beat the last boss before writing this and the game froze and I had to play it over again.<br /><br />The first Mass Effect game on ps3 is not for the impatient gamer. I had to watch many scenes over again because of little bugs and glitches.<br /><br />Another complaint I have about the first game is the blandness of some of the environments. I bet pc version has cool mods to fix this.<br /><br />I still give it four stars because I like the ambition the game had for the time.<br /><br />But I am not used to playing games that are this unpolished, It is kind of jarring really.	2015-08-21

Straight to what you want to know: The joysticks on these are not good. They have an enormous deadzone in the center and near the edges it's full tilt. That means while this might be okay for some games where precision isn't at all needed, don't even consider playing Goldeneye. You wont be able to aim, even walking in that game is difficult. Certain moves in Smash will not be easy but you can get by. Feels like this joystick only has sensitivity between 60% and 100%. The joystick is also really stiff, moreso than the original controllers were at launch. I bought three of these so I know these findings are not a fluke.<br /><br />And you won't be able to replace the joystick. Not as easily as normal, at least. These are not like the normal controller where the assembly plugs into a slot. The wires actually go straight to the main board. It looks the same as the real deal on the outside, but it's not the same on the inside.<br /><br />However everything else besides the joystick is great. The build quality feels just as good as a real one. The buttons actually feel better than a real one, they're more clicky. If the joystick were better these would be perfect.<br /><br />Overall unless you're in a pinch, I would suggest buying a used controller on ebay rather than getting these. I got a couple used official controllers for $15 that still had fairly tight sticks. Clear, too. So for only a dollar or two more, get the real thing.	2015-08-21

I ordered this so I could play N64 games on Project64. I have a Windows 8.1 laptop (Lenovo Yoga 2) and I didn't even have to install any drivers, I just plugged it in and set the buttons. It works flawlessly!<br /><br />The controller has all of the same buttons as a real N64 controller, but is lighter weight. I highly recommend it for playing N64 roms!	2015-08-21

US	34311542	RQKQVDDOKW5MU	B00YXO5X4M	832423177	Turtle Beach - Ear Force Stealth 420X Fully Wireless Gaming Headset (Certified Refurbished) - Xbox One	Video Games	5	4	5	Y	N	An easy five stars.	I received the Ear Force Stealth 420X headset to review through the courtesy of the amazon vine program. Really, there is nothing not to love about this headset. I know every time I try a new design I say it's the best I've ever owned, but I have to say it again, and very emphatically this time.<br /><br />First of all, everything about the Ear Force 420X is comfortable and user friendly. The padded headpiece keeps the headset from rubbing on the top of your head. Some of us don't have thick hair and that's important to the length of time we will be able to keep them on and keep on playing. The ear pieces are also nicely padded and fit over your ears. And while it is not a cheap lightweight, it's easy to forget you are wearing it after a while. There is no discomfort anywhere.<br /><br />The mic is well positioned to be convenient but out of the way. It can be positioned so it doesn't pick up every huff and chuff and all the mouth-breathing you do when you forget everyone's listening. And you can hear your own voice in your earpieces so don't have to guess at the volume you are transmitting. The headphones fit so well they block out most of the ambient noise in the room despite the fact they are not noise-canceling. And wow, the sound you hear through them! Every audible detail comes through loud and clear. And I do mean clear. In one instance I heard footsteps of someone creeping up on me in a game I had never heard before. No arguing, these are superior headphones. And the ear pieces can be turned 90 degrees to uncover your ear so you can stop and listen to someone talking to you in the room, or answer a phone or something without removing them. Very clever.<br /><br />They are wireless and rechargeable with the enclosed cable. They are easy to pair with your system, using the enclosed usb. Every time you start or end a process, a female voice tells you what you have done: &#34;Powering on.&#34; &#34;Powering off.&#34; &#34;Pairing device.&#34; &#34;Device has been paired.&#34; Very handy since you can't always see what you've pressed on the earpiece while you're wearing them, and figuring out what the flashing/solid red/green lights mean is no longer necessary.<br /><br />Designed strictly for using with your Xbox One, and it mentions mobile devices, but I have not tested them on anything but the Xbox One and don't intend to. These headphones are a fantastic bargain, especially since they have dropped in price by fifty dollars in the month since release. You get a whole lot for the money. Five solid stars.	2015-08-21

It works on Smash Brothers perfectly and all four slots for the controllers work great! Now I can play smash with my friends and not have to play on the not so fun to use Wiimotes!<br /><br />The company who sells this has awesome customer service. The first one I recieved didn't work and I contacted them and they replaced it no questions asked!

It comes with everything you need for hotswapping & recharging the batteries, or just charging them while still in the controller.  The quality &#34;feeling&#34; for all the items is also very good.  The problem comes down the line after several hours/months of use.  I think it was around a year when the batteries started to have very short lives.  You can't realistically expect them to last forever, so the question is how long do they need to last for you to feel you've gotten a good value.  If about a year sounds good, then you'll be very happy with this product.  If you want a bit more, say 2 years, then you'll be a little disappointed.  Anything beyond that, you shouldn't even consider these.	2015-08-21

Haven't used it on Open Rails yet, but hoping to try soon. The price may be eye-watering, but it is worth it for the true railfan.<br /><br />Couple of issues I did notice, but most of these are a result of the train sim: occasionally the simulator will ignore the throttle and reset it to zero. Also, some locomotives will not respond to either the brakes or throttle. Again, this is a problem with TS2015, but is useful for people to know.<br /><br />One problem I have with the raildriver is that the throttle is fairly unresponsive. You have to open up the throttle by about 20% before the controller notices the movement. It's not a large problem, but one that would be nice to fix later on.	2015-08-21

And the terran and zerg campaigns in this game (vanilla, not brood war) have been outdone by their novelizations: Liberty's Crusade by Jeff Grubb, and Queen of Blades by Aaron Rosenberg. I strongly recommend them.	2015-08-21

From other reviews on the laptop, I knew that my HP Stream 11's trackpad wasn't going to be 100% smooth, so I thought an optical mouse would come in handy.<br /><br />I tried this mouse out for the first time yesterday and it was nothing short of bliss. The setup was easy--take out the usb that is underneath the mouse itself and connect to your laptop, pop in a AA battery, press the little clear button in the top, and you're good to go.<br /><br />The mouse feels good in the hand and I credit this to the shape of the mouse itself and textured grips on the side. The mouse shape is the opposite of the more popular, flatter shape (think Apple), therefore making it more suitable to the natural cup of your hand when using a mouse.<br /><br />As I've only used this for one day, I can't speak on the longevity of it yet. If I run into any problems with it, I'll make sure to update this review.	2015-08-21

First of all, if you see the price still listed as $199, then that is incorrect , it should only be $69.99,<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great way to play your Retail GBA games, game mods/fan translations, or even homebrew.<br />While it can play gbc/gb game backups, it can not read the cartridges.<br />And it dose not support multiplayer in gbc/gb.<br />But multiplayer on GBA works great, and it even supports the multiboot (downloadplay) games like mario kart!<br /><br />The buttons are very responsive, it comes with tv-out, so you can play your games on the big screen. (kinda like a built in gameboy player)<br />And it runs your GBA games at FULL 60fps, and even in higher resolution the the original GBA.<br /><br />for your mods and homebrew you have an easy to access real-time clock.<br />it seems to have some time slippage, but it stays on time for the most part, and is easy to fix the time with the quick menu.(that can be launched while in game)<br /><br />overall this a great device, yes, I was provided with a review copy, but this is still my main way to play gba games now<br /><br />THE ONLY DRAW BACKS:<br />-many gba accessories DO NOT WORK (game cube link, e-reader, battle chip gate, etc)<br />-can not transfer saves to/from cartridge.<br />-no auto save backup when running from sd card (you must manually use the button combo, or enter the menu in order to transfer your save from the ram to the sd card :P )<br />-can not run/backup gb/gbc games (not a big deal, but would be nice)<br />-real time clock's time can start to slip after a while (dose not affect games run from cartridge)<br />-x/y buttons can not be re-mapped (they just act as L/R)<br /><br />But none of those drawbacks are a big enough deal to make me dislike the revo k101+<br />just some things that would be nice to add,<br /><br />and about 90% of them are possible with accessories or software updates,<br />so it's possible that they may be added in the future!<br />but as of now, I love thek101+ and highly recommend it AS IS!<br /><br />you can see my full review here:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMHbl_-_VME	2015-08-21

I bought these Gunnar Optiks DES-05101 Steel Series for gaming, after returning the Gunnar Optiks INT.  They are amazing, but I had to return them and the other set, because they are simply not wide enough for my head.  I'm 6'2&#34;, 215 pounds.  I guess my head is slightly larger than average, because the arms of the glasses just barely slid over my head and ears.  I could only game for about 10 minutes before I felt pressure.  It's a shame, because at the time these were the widest frames available.  I wish they were wider and fit better, because they really were great at cutting down the glare, and making the image sharper.  If Gunnar makes glass frames for wider heads in the future, I will definitely buy a pair!	2015-08-21

Straight to what you want to know: The joysticks on these are not good. They have an enormous deadzone in the center and near the edges it's full tilt. That means while this might be okay for some games where precision isn't at all needed, don't even consider playing Goldeneye. You wont be able to aim, even walking in that game is difficult. Certain moves in Smash will not be easy but you can get by. Feels like this joystick only has sensitivity between 60% and 100%. The joystick is also really stiff, moreso than the original controllers were at launch. I bought three of these so I know these findings are not a fluke.<br /><br />And you won't be able to replace the joystick. Not as easily as normal, at least. These are not like the normal controller where the assembly plugs into a slot. The wires actually go straight to the main board. It looks the same as the real deal on the outside, but it's not the same on the inside.<br /><br />However everything else besides the joystick is great. The build quality feels just as good as a real one. The buttons actually feel better than a real one, they're more clicky.

Each mission is 10-15 minutes long and has you performing several objectives before calling in for evacuation. Enemies patrol the map, adding a small stealth element to gameplay as patrols will call in endless reinforcements when spotted. It's very easy to get overwhelmed and with limited resources you have to play smartly on the highest difficulties.<br /><br />The highlight of the game is the fast paced, absurd gameplay. Enemies are rather smart, splitting up into groups to cut off your path while attacking aggressively. All equipment, including respawning players, are dropped in via massive drop pods (similar to Warhammer 40,000) that crush anything they land on. There's a ludicrous amount of firepower available including mini-nukes, mech suits, strafing runs, mini-guns, and auto-turrets that will shoot any foe they see with reckless abandon even if you're standing in its path. Friendly fire is always on which sounds unappealing but trust me, there's nothing more fun than a perfect run going to crap because someone panicked and tore through your unit.<br /><br />Helldivers is one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had on consoles. It works excellently with local co-op and it's the only game I think is best with random strangers.	2015-08-21

This Game is awful! it starts out pretty fun at fist but the creators didn't seem to understand basic game design. the player is not eased into a strange world but instead you get the feeling you are in a hopeless situation where all odds are against you. at first the game plays smoothly, introducing new enemies and opening up new areas, but it suddenly sends you out to destroy a monster that you are in no way ready to face. The monster can be fought until time runs out (which is 50 minuets) without dying. It calls up is offspring to help and if you kill them the game gust generates more. in short you are fighting a losing battle and the stupid game will not go any farther until you finish it. also if you stop to drink a heath potion instead of pausing the game play like most good games do, this peace of crap lets everything attack while you are helpless so you end up with less life then you started with, and if by some twist of fate you do manage to hurt the monster then it runs away and by the time you tract it down it has regained it's health. This unfair game play  leaves the player feeling angry which defeats the point of a game in the first place.<br /> On top of all that there is a serious control overload with this game i have played it for a week and the controls are still getting mixed up. I think it stupid if a game needs me to stand on my head, jump up and down three times while holding the X button just to make something simple happen. A good game should be simple to learn yet hard to master. This game takes a huge investment of time to learn only to make you feel like it is programmed to stop you from ever mastering it. I wish that these big game companies would take the time to read a book on proper game design before they make crap like this.	2015-08-21

Straight to what you want to know: The joysticks on these are not good. They have an enormous deadzone in the center and near the edges it's full tilt. That means while this might be okay for some games where precision isn't at all needed, don't even consider playing Goldeneye. You wont be able to aim, even walking in that game is difficult. Certain moves in Smash will not be easy but you can get by. Feels like this joystick only has sensitivity between 60% and 100%. The joystick is also really stiff, moreso than the original controllers were at launch. I bought three of these so I know these findings are not a fluke.<br /><br />And you won't be able to replace the joystick. Not as easily as normal, at least. These are not like the normal controller where the assembly plugs into a slot. The wires actually go straight to the main board. It looks the same as the real deal on the outside, but it's not the same on the inside.<br /><br />However everything else besides the joystick is great. The build quality feels just as good as a real one. The buttons actually feel better than a real one, they're more clicky. If the joystick were better these would be perfect.<br /><br />Overall unless you're in a pinch, I would suggest buying a used controller on ebay rather than getting these. I got a couple used official controllers for $15 that still had fairly tight sticks. Clear, too. So for only a dollar or two more, get the real thing.	2015-08-21

I found the game to be quite good in the tradition of FF, but there are some weak spots.<br /><br />The graphics are quite impressive for being on the DS. Models are full 3D and there is even some voice acting done in the game (even though it is a little rough) Plenty of on screen enemies, with no noticeable slow down to the game. The battle system is hack and slash with some magic elements mixed in (much like Kingdom Hearts), and not turned based ( which I miss). The magic is a little peculiar in this game, because there are only 10 or so basic spells and instead of learning them and using MP to use it, you collect orbs and use those. Without the orbs, even with full MP, you can't use the magic. Odd choice.<br /><br />The story is a little slow. You basically collect new additions to your party as you travel the world map. There is an ominous figure mentioned here and there, but no idea what his main plot is. There is a huge time jump and your characters are suddenly like 5 years older.<br /><br />The puzzles are pretty unique although a bit tricky at times. The dungeon rooms can get a tad disorienting since they look the same and it can be easy to go around in circles.<br /><br />Fun game overall.  Recommended	2015-08-21

It also removes the need to turn a controller on and off to get from app to app.  My only complaint is that there are no numbers on the remote. With the cable box integration, OneGuide is a cool feature but since there are no numbers you have to scroll up and down to find channels instead of being able to input them directly.<br /><br />As for the remote itself, the remote looks good and feels sturdy. I've had the remote for at least 9 months and the battery still hasn't needed to be replaced. Oil from your fingers can show up on the remote's rubbery texture, but its easily cleaned.	2015-08-21

Well, this time they were pretty accurate. No story is not a problem for me, and the graphics seemed to look pretty decent on the screenshots that I seen. So what was bad about this? Weapons have no stats! They just have a level, and a particular monster that they're strong against. If you want to know what type of monster that is weak against a particular monster, then you have to look in the manual and remember, because the game don't have that info. Some areas are just a big open space that's drab and full of nothing, and others are just narrow hallway mazes that go down floors. The bad thing is that I read that there is a glitch in floor dungeons to where you cannot progress any further if the game decides not to not randomly generate something very important, and never does at all. So you have to warp out of the dungeon and start over. Something along those lines. NO DIABLO HERE!	2015-08-21

Great Accessory!	This thing has everything. A vertical stand for your ps4, that holds it securely, 2 dualshock 4 charge-dock slots, and a 4 port usb hub in the front. Weighs more than the regular stand or dock, and looks sleeker than the standard USB hub. If you're trying to keep all your PS4 stuff in the same place, this thing is great for organization. Plus, you can plug in another charge dock, and charge 4 at once! So if you've got a lot of controllers, I recommend this, to help you keep them organized. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-21

This is definitely the best Android TV box out now and definitely the go-to if you plan on gaming on it.

It's one of my favorite team fighting rpg games I've played. I really wish they had made more legend of dragoon games. But hopefully they bring it back in the future some time..<br />I've never hard anyone dislike this game that played it. So if you a big rpg fan that likes the final fantasy like games then you hit the jackpot playing this game.<br />First you start out playing as a regular character upgrading weapons and armor and what not. But then after So far in the beginning of the game you'll find a dragoon power, giving you magical armor with wings, also giving yourself extra combo attacks with magical super attacks.<br /><br />You will later find companions down the road which you'll find dragoon powers for them also.<br /><br />Your attackers will be set off every 30-60 steps you take outta the town area's. They'll be a light indicator on the top of your guy's head showing how close you are to the next attackers set off battle.<br />Every time you go into battle you'll gain experience points, items and gold, which will help you buy stuff, sell stuff in towns, and make your guy upgrade in his or hers levels.<br /><br />The game itself is 4 CD disks. It's a good long length game, but a lot of the CD space I figure is full its detail in beauty and artwork which is way worth it.<br />If I bought this game today i'd still pay $40-$50 dollars for it. This I believe is a well worth and needed game for the PlayStation, ahead of it's time.	2015-08-21

I took a point off because it's black on black with black buttons and if you put it down on a black coffee table... it disappears. ;-)  Needs to come with additional usage instructions, it took me a bit to figure out how to adjust the volume (the Nvidia Shield Android TV has a volume adjustment separate from your receiver or other audio device).  P.S. I forgot to mention the audio volume is adjusted with a touch sensitive strip down the middle of the remote.  Very cool, but also have touched it by accident too.    Having the built in mic for audio searches (I hope commands at some point too - if that is not already available), and a headphone/mic jack for nighttime listening is another reason I went for this accessory.  I can understand that keeping it &#34;out&#34; of the Pro package was a price point / profit thing, but really, this Remote should be included as part of the original Nvidia Shield Pro package.	2015-08-21

My first &#34;real&#34; arcade stick and I'm in love with it! I went from a Hori Mini to this and when it comes to arcade sticks you get what you pay for. This feels premium, buttons feel great, the stick itself feels precise, and I love the weight and the bottom cushion. The storage compartment is awesome, no more wrapping my cord around, and the ability to switch from last gen to current gen is God like. Very happy with my purchase, and it came just in time for the Street Fighter V beta! Good job Mad Catz!	2015-08-21

I can't comment on using this to stream to another television or use TV services because I have no reason to do that, but what IS happening here is that you're getting a current Sony gaming console for $35-40. IT'S A GAMING CONSOLE. I didn't want to spend $200-ish on Vita just to play a few games I was interested in, but a little non-obstrusive little thing that costs me much less that plays those games and other older generation stuff ON MY TV? That sounds great. The games upscale very nicely.<br /><br />The only thing you could complain about is how it doesn't support -every- Vita game or every PSP game. Here, look at a list and see if it supports your game or not:<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_Vita_games<br /><br />As you can see, the ones with &#34;No&#34;s are generally games you probably don't care about anyway because they're older titles, ports or games you probably would rather play on an actual console regardless if you're using a TV (Call of Duty, some fighting games). The list of not-compatible PSP games is also pretty short and mostly uninteresting games, save for Dracula X Chronicles, which is the only knock I have against the whole thing.<br /><br />I don't know how else I can clearly say it. You get to play a new library of games for ~$40. When has anything close to a current console been $40? It puts those small details and hard to read text up on your HD television. So...if streaming lag is a problem for remote play or whatever else you're trying to do, instead just play on the main TV anyway? Get your own house? lol. It's a Vita. On your TV. It works great. $40.	2015-08-21

Amazing advance in technology and convergence experience that &#34;might&#34; give some of the gaming platforms a run for their money in the future.  Streaming games is smooth (via Ethernet) and range of available games good.  Game controllers are well liked by my console savvy kids (ages 15 and 11). Remote was a necessary addition for anyone wanting to use the &#34;TV&#34; part of the system who is a little intimidated by game controllers... and it is a marvel as well, with Audio volume control hidden as a contact surface in the middle of the remote (bought separately). TV convergence experience with Google Play is really phenomenal and the speed of the processors is evident in the quality of the image (we're limited to 1080p, but this baby will do 4K too). I purchased it to converge our TV experience (using a Tablo PVR/OTA Tuner and associated Android App) with a little side gaming and the ability to rent Movies and shows as needed.  Windows Media Centre with multiple OTA Tuners was our prior system, but the hardware and software kept needing maintenance, and being in the 50 years + range, we wanted something a little easier for everyone to control.  Apple TV was our prior Movie/TV Rental source - so we'll see how that compares, and Netflix the main consumption of our kids - which is of course included as a built-in App and well implemented.  My only desire out the gate would be to be able to have more control over the start-up home screen configuration, and possibly be able to program it to jump directly into our Tablo App, without having to do a bunch of scrolling and clicking, since that is it's primary use.  All in all I am awed at the wonderful engineering that went into this (it feels like it is built like a sleek, futuristic airship, solid), the processor speed is amazing, quality of the picture absolutely better than most of what we've experienced so far.  I have no regrets.	2015-08-21
