They provide position control, keeping your heal over the center of the back of the dandle, and do not constrain the front of your foot, because they have the classic thong style sandal front.  The arch and base of the sandal has good support and can be worn for hours without break-in.  The only negative that I can say is that Olukai has many very nice leather sandals with leather soles, I really wish I could buy this shoe in all leather.

The design is pretty and the soles and laces are super cute. Six year old loved them when she saw them online and in person. They are perfect for a Frozen inspired design. I deducted two stars due to the fact the shoes didn't hold up in construction. Just picked up my daughter  from her 2nd day of soccer camp (two half days) and the clear wrap design has come off on the toe areas after only two days of use. They never would make it through an entire soccer season. I would reccomend for 3-4 year olds and think they may hold up or as novelty pair to wear a few times to switch out but not for wear and tear usuage.	2015-08-14

My box arrived looped shut and obviously damaged.  Upon opening the box, one shoe looked like it had been tried on by a foot that was too big and stretched. I'm very disappointed as I have foot problems and needed the cushioning and support this brand provides as I stand at work for 8 hours a day or more if I have to cover the next shift. I was looking forward to these, now I'm going to return them.  Very NOT happy.	2015-08-14

They don't provide the ease of use like regular flip flops, in that you have to work a bit to get them on. They also took me some time to get used to in between my toes. That part is a little wider than most flip flops, I think. I also find that my feet tend to slide toward the instep of the sandal. I have very high arches and they are still pretty new, so it might just require more breaking in. Overall, I like them. They are definitely cute and I've gotten multiple compliments on them. They aren't as comfortable as I would like, but I think they will get better with time.	2015-08-14

I wore these shoes for a solid 24 hours straight (during the 48 hour film project) without discomfort. I have not worn them with socks and find the inner lining to be comfortable. They are very cute, too! The red color is great in person. I like that I can wear them on my bike commute to work comfortably, but they're nice enough to wear with office attire.<br />My biggest complaint about flats in general is that the heel collapses a bit and the leather gets torn up from coming in contact with the ground. That doesn't appear to be a possibility given the way these are constructed.<br />I can't say they're 5 stars yet because I haven't had them long enough to determine their life expectancy. But if they're like any of the other Timbs I own, expect a long life.	2015-08-14

Even though they have extra cushion they mold to your foot so that they don't feel like you are walking on an odd platform, as it does on some cheaper shoes. I rated that they have good arch support, which I think they do if you have a normal foot. If you have a pronated foot, I would either get some wedge inserts or try a Saloman shoe that is made for a pronated foot.	2015-08-14

I have always wore prescription glasses with transitional lenses, so I never wore sun glasses, until now. I have started wearing contacts and quickly started looking for the perfect sun glasses. My search is over!! Mambo Shades Sunglasses with resin frames and polarized lenses are not only stylish but provide safety for your eyes. The frame is very comfortable around both the nose and ears allowing for a great fit. The polarized lenses are made with high quality in mind. They are glare, smudge and scratch resistant so you can enjoy your daily activities without the worry of damaging your glasses. They come in both black and brown, I personally got the brown and can wear them with any outfit. If you are looking for a good quality pair of sunglasses without spending a small fortune I suggest you give these a try.. I know you will love them as I do. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-14

I bought these shoes because I had heard pretty good reviews on ADIDAS shoes. I ordered a size smaller than I normally do, but I shouldn't have. They don't lace as tightly as I'd like. The shoes also rubbed against my pinkie toe. As far as overall comfort, I felt like I was walking on bare concrete whenever I wore these shoes. There is literally no arch support in the shoes and I could watch as my feet flattened out with each step. There is absolutely no cushioning in the shoe and you can't even replace the insole because the existing one is stitched in. The only plus this shoes has going for it is that it's a cute shoe. I ordered the grey polka dots with the orange trim.	2015-08-14

I don't know why the product name says &#34;Women's&#34; as these are a pretty generic Wayfarer shape that looks great on men as well. In fact, this particular model is quintessentially male hipster. The semi-translucent gray frames are darker than they appear here (check it out on Polaroid.com or other retailers), so I would say they actually more &#34;masculine&#34; than &#34;feminine&#34; (if I had to be gender-normative).<br /><br />The polarization works great, and these are just cheap enough that you won't be too sad if you accidentally stomp on them or leave them on a bus in Cancun (like I did).	2015-08-14

No matter how many times I throw them in the washing machine, my daughter's feet stink the very next time she wears them like the worse teenage boy's gym shoes.

VerY VERY close to the Stuart Weitzman gladiators if you're looking for a more affordable look-alike. I recommend these. Any other brand isn't the same. I felt they fit true to size (i wear 6 1/2) The elastic bands on the calf also fit me fine. I don't think they are too crazy big, I'm 5'0 , 110 lbs and my calfs are pretty average, maybe a bit toned. But I was able to fit them just fine. As another customer pointed out, the shoes came packaged in original box but were folded over in the box (its not a long rectangular box. more squared) so that did cause some creasing/twisted parts in the back elastic bands but not too much. It didn't bother me, also I'm sure with continued use, they will form flat back to normal. I've gotten a ton of compliments so far. I'm happy with them. Thanks!	2015-08-14

Every other pair of sandals  I've gotten for him have fallen apart. I was tired of spending money on shoes that didn't last so I decided to spend a little bit more for these. It was worth it. They still look brand new after three months of heavy use, and they seem comfortable. I'm glad I purchased these high quality sandals.	2015-08-14

Went to Alaska for 3 weeks including 7day backpacking in the Wrangell mountains in the rugged terrain. It held quite good in the extreme conditions, wetlands, boulders, glaciers, small rocks, bushes everything. Had a few minor wears which caused water to seep in the boots.

They also feel a bit heavy and almost clunky.  I have been wearing them daily for over a week.  They also make my feet sweat and smell. :(.  I paid 70 dollars for them &#34;on sale&#34; at a local shoe store.  I wish i would of taken them back.  The 3 strap sandal really doesnt work out for my foot.	2015-08-14

Not durable, broken in one month.	Negatives<br /><br />1. Picture does not accurately represent what I received. The sides on the pair I received are a light, clear orange color that does not match the tortoise shell portion of the front frame.<br /><br />2. Instead of more durable plastic, the main side arms are weak and thin metal with tiny screws of just the type that fall out in a little bit of time.<br /><br />3. One main reason to pay so much for &#34;reading&#34; glasses is style, however another reason would be a durable design.<br /><br />4. Spring loaded hinges that should be a &#34;plus&#34; are more of an issue because they have parts to fall out and break.<br /><br />5. Style looks good from the front, shoddy on the sides.<br /><br />On the plus side (two stars):<br /><br />1. Lens quality is quite clear and good.<br /><br />2. Glasses come with a very nice case.<br /><br />If you're looking for the more durable all plastic clunky frame type setup that can handle hooking on a tee shirt neck or tossing in a pocket, these are not it. Also, if you want more consistent style, maybe Orvis (but much more money).<br /><br />If you are gentle on your reading glasses and also, if you don't care what they look like other than looking at yourself in the mirror directly, you may enjoy these glasses.  If I find out that the seller has changed the photograph to show what I received, I'll add a star.  If they break or have further issues in 90 days or less, I'm knocking a star.<br /><br />Edit Sept. 6, 2015<br /><br />The right arm fell off. Now I have one out of two pairs left. The picture has not changed, and one of two pair are broken. Knocking another star.<br /><br />Edit August 25, 2016<br />It has been several months since the arm broke off of the second pair that I barely used. Two out of two pairs failed. Not going to update this review anymore.	2015-08-14

I started running just this year in traditional 8 mm drop shoes from a major brand, with stiff arch support inserts.  After a knee injury, I started reading into running technique and discovered the benefits of zero drop shoes, minimalist shoes.  I bought another pair of Altra's with light padding and really like them.  I bought this pair because they have &#34;medium padding&#34; and I'm using them just to get started since I run on concrete and want extra padding while I toughen up my tendons.<br /><br />What I love most about these shoes is the roomy toe box.  Why is it so hard to find shoes that shaped like real feet?!  I am DONE with cramming my toes into shoes that are not shaped like a real foot.	2015-08-14

I would not suggest them for anyone with a wide foot. They're a little narrow, but that's part of what makes them more comfortable for my narrow size 6.	2015-08-14

I have had good luck with New Balance as far as finding my shoes which give me lots of support, and they are one of the few companies that make them in a narrow size. (B).  I tried the Dunhams because I liked the way they looked.  They are a very nice shoe, and the fit is good, but I have noticed that these tend to run just a bit large.  So if you need a size 10.5 for instance, you can probably order them in a 10. Overall I'm happy with these and the way they look, but I do caution you that they seem to be just a bit larger than some of the other NB shoes that I have ordered and used in the past.	2015-08-14

When the first versions of Saucony Ride came out I found the soles far too soft so that my landings felt unstable.  But when at last the Ride 6 was made available, I knew I'd found my way back to Saucony.  Though I have always worn a size 6.5 street shoe and a 7 med. running shoe, I had to buy a 7.5 medium in the Ride 6 in the citron color.  Because they were so comfortable ( they do not have a lot of arch support, so I replaced the factory insoles with arch insoles), I ordered another pair in silver-gray/green in a 7.5 medium but, upon running in them, I found they were half size too long and altered my stride. Since it was too late to send them back, I've kept them for dog walking but it seems wrong and is rather frustrating to discover that an athletic shoe company like Saucony would manufacture shoes that vary in size depending on which color one buys.  To my mind, this is the source of customers' various reviews with regard to fit; there is a lack of consistency when it comes to sizing.	2015-08-14

They look just like the &#34;Break My Heart&#34; flat gladiator sandals made popular by Gentle Souls.  I have several pairs of the &#34;Break My Heart&#34; gladiator sandal and really love them, so I figured this wedge would be a great addition to my ever-growing shoe wardrobe.  I take an 8 or 8 1/2 B width, depending upon the manufacturer.  Since the reviews indicated this shoe ran a bit big, I ordered the size 8, and the fit is spot-on. My toes don't spill over the top of the sandal and the sides of my feet are not squeezed by the straps and ties. The color is a nice neutral - like a stone beige - that goes with everything.  I wore these sandals most of the day, in hot weather, standing and walking, and did not experience any foot aches or pains.  However, the reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the way the shoe is designed.  The platform is rigid and doesn't bend with your foot.  As a result, the heel part is not flexible, and is not as snug as it should be. So my heel slips up and down with each step.  Will probably get some heel inserts to minimize this issue.  Other than that complaint, I like these shoes - they are pretty, stylish and fashion-forward.	2015-08-14

I enjoy line dancing and take classes two nights a week and try to get in at least one night of social dancing every month. I have wanted a pair of western cowboy boots for quite some time but the ones I see have been at least $100 and up in price.  I saw these boots and figured I would give them a try.  Well, don’t assume the cheaper price means cheaper quality.  These boots are nearly perfect! The leather material is soft and comfortable on the leg and foot.  It moves well and is not stiff.  The toe bed is a little narrower than I am used to, which might stretch some as I continue to wear them.  I have a larger than normal ankle due to a fracture and surgery over six years ago, but the scar tissue and mobility remains a problem. I have trouble with taller boots when I have to point and bend the foot to slip it in.  I also have large calves so I was concerned about being able to get the boots on.  They are advertised as fitting a 14-15” inch calf and there is plenty of room, even with jeans on.  The tabs on the side of the boot also help with getting them on easily.  I ordered a 6.5 which is my normal street shoe size and I would say they run true to size.  If you have a wide foot however you might want to go up in size as the toe does narrow to a point. I ordered these boots in black, as when we line dance our outfits are black jeans or skirts.  There is some detailed stitching on the boots giving them that western flair.  I don’t think the design is as noticeable on the black as on the brown.  The heel is a great height at around 2 inches, so you remain steady on your feet and don’t have to worry about a higher heel throwing you off balance when you spin and turn, but you still have a raised heel for heel taps or stomping, making the line dancing all the more fun and enjoyable. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I would recommend this boot to anyone who enjoys the western look of cowboy boots, they are so cute with jeans or shorts for that casual cowgirl look.  I would buy them again in another color.	2015-08-14

I ran in these when going for a late night show on the streets and managed to walk faster then my friend who was wearing flats. Of course you still have to be careful these aren't sports shoes, but they are very stable and you feel balanced. I only start to feel tiredness after 4 hours of walking and even then its nothing compared to heels twice less of their height. I think personally if you wear heals occasionally, 8-10 hours is a good time frame to be in sandals of this height. Not to mention they look good and classic, whether you wear jeans or a dress. Fit true to size 8.5M, or EU 39.	2015-08-14

From the reviews of these shoes, some people said that they were too large and others said that they fit fine. I think that the reason for the discrepancy is due to the use case for the shoe. I found that these shoes were definitely too large at my normal shoe size for indoor soccer. I want my indoor shoes to be very snug on my feet so my feet are not sliding around inside the shoe. I have returned my pair for a half size smaller.<br />However, for casual use (not indoor soccer) the normal shoe size should be perfectly fine.<br />That being said, the shoes are very comfortable. Its been a long time since I've used kangaroo leather shoes. They also have a great 80's throwback look.	2015-08-14

I have very wide feet with hard core bunions on both big toe and pinky side of foot. These shoes were accommodating enough to have these parts of my foot under the edge of the shoe. Others I have tried are too narrow and these parts of the foot stretch over the front lip of the shoe.  I have tried dozens of styles of flats, and these are the winners. On the flip side, if you had very narrow feet, it might not work for you.  They don't have arch support, but for the price, I don't care!

Stop looking at these reviews, it fits as expected, that's all you need to know, now GO AND BUY SOME. Seriously I wear these every. Single. Day. Do you know how nice it is to have brand new shoes that you don't have to break in? No, you don't, because you've never had any like these!! I got them in the charcoal stripe and they are beautiful. The yoga mat is so so comfy. I was worried that the part between the toes would rub, but it doesn't. I usually wear a 5-5.5 and the 5 fits like a glove! The charcoal go with anything. I get compliments all the time! Sanuk has done it again. These are worth the normal price, and the ones on Amazon are even discounted so GET SOME! The only thing I noticed at the beginning was that sometimes the inside of my feet slide to the side but it's pretty rare! Also, it's hard to put these on one handed, but still way faster than tying your shoes. Have I sold you yet? Good. You're welcome. Oh about the picture.. There was the tiniest imperfection where the mat had been a tiny bit scratched. You don't notice it and they aren't effected (affected? I can't ever get those right..) by it.	2015-08-14

WORST pair of Reefs I've ever purchased.<br />When possible I wear flip flops to do EVERYTHING!  That being said I bought these Reefs after my last pair (which lasted about 14 months) fell apart.  I thought the &#34;cushioning&#34; would make them last longer and be more comfortable.  Problem is the air bubble is COMPLETELY cosmetic.  As with any air cushioning (think Nike Air MAX) there is a structure inside that is supposed to provide some support to the air bubbly.  The structure inside this is so hard that at no point does the air bubble flex to provide any sort of cushioning.  This in effect places your heal about 3/4&#34; off the ground and the only cushioning provided is about 1/4&#34; of foam.<br />After wearing these flip flops for a week my feet and knees hurt worst then they ever have.  The arch support is almost non existent and because the heal doesn't absorb any impact the sandals create an almost &#34;high heel&#34; type situation.  Not sure what the other 3000 people found great about these sandals?!?	2015-08-14

You can use it as a hold  wrist clutch or turn it into a crossbody purse. I did receive mine free of charge to try it and share my honest opinion. It is made of leather and it's really soft. You can fit your wallet and phone and other things easily inside it.There is an inside zippered pouch that divides it and an outside zippered pocket as well. The stiches are very well done and the zipper works perfectly and matches the design . The handle attaches by clipping into the hoops on both ends of the clutch. great product as usual and I do recommend it	2015-08-14

Wearing them daily in my home city, they were very comfortable and I had no problems with them. After walking around all day for several days in Paris I did get blisters on my heels and toes, and the bottoms of my feet got very sore. I used band-aids until my blisters became calloused and used Dr Scholls gel inserts for the rest of the trip, and my feet were fine. Keep in mind we were walking many miles each day on pavement, though the other two people in my group never got blisters (one did opt for Dr Scholls). I've worn them every day since I got back including jogging on the treadmill and they have been comfortable. The logo on the side is subtle enough that I wore these to nice restaurants and clubs.	2015-08-14

This one is a winner! It manages to combine height, style and comfort beautifully!  The shoe is very well made, bordeaux color is a gorgeous deep red that provides a nice contrast, specially for those with fairer skin. The style also makes the feet look slim. This shoe will definitely get a lot of use this coming fall and in many years to come! The only minor negative for me was the fit. I'm typically a size 7 (US) and got this in 37.5 as suggested, but found it just a tad loose although the slingbacks are adjustable which helps. The 37 would probably have been a teeny bit small so I'm hanging on to these. All in all, still a keeper.	2015-08-14

I'd been waiting somewhere shy of five days to finally open the door and see them on my doorstep. You can imagine my delight at waking up from a nap to see a massive box sitting on the stoop, knowing what was inside.<br />First let's talk about the packaging. They came in a shoe box, the label on top deeming that they were indeed the boots. Open them up and they were separated by a cardboard lining with individual wrappings for each boot. Nice.<br />Now comes the meat and potatoes of this venture: putting them on. Firstly it took around fifteen minutes for me to lace and unbuckle the both of them and another twenty to put just one of them on. The fit was, well, a little too large and especially spacious in the toe but they are easy to walk around in so long as you mind where you're putting your feet.<br />Now, my calves are quite large and I will have to put another hole in the top straps in order for them to buckle, and if you have large calves like myself you might find some difficulty in lacing them up. If you use the standard lacing method you might not even be able to loop them through the top loops.<br />For this I recommend the double helix lace.<br />All and all very nice boots. The shine is something I quite enjoy and there were no imperfections.<br />Here is the part where I offer some advice: if you want these boots to last, zip them up before you lace them and be sure to completely unlace and unbuckle them before you take them off/put them back on. The zipper may seem strong, but put enough pressure on it and no doubt it'll break. Trust me on this I've ruined a pair of boots by thinking I could just zip them on without unlacing them.	2015-08-14

Unfortunately, I was sent the wrong size -- I had ordered a 7M, and the box said 7M, but the shoes in the box were 7.5M.

I ended up returning the mis-sized shoes and ordering them from a department store -- and they are extremely comfortable and fit just fine!	2015-08-14

These are very comfy and give more support than most flip flops. However, I have lost a couple jewels off of them already. The Brussels style has not lost any, and that's worth the extra money to me. I had to try both before buying more. I'm going with the Brussels from here out. These are lower than the brussels style, and may be a safer option for some. Still very good flops!!	2015-08-14

They are comfortable, well made, and there's plenty of room in the toe for my duck feet. I only gave them four stars because they are sized just a little too big. I never wear anything smaller than a 9, sometimes 9 1/2. The size 9 I got are definitely a little too big but I went ahead and kept them because having a little too much toe room is better than not enough. And I can wear them with double socks in the winter. This is just the chance you take buying something online instead of trying it on in the store.	2015-08-14

This bag is excellent for the price. I love its medium size.

I find it interesting that of the many reviews, (though I didn't read all of them) I didn't come across ANY that mentioned the SMELL.  As soon as I opened the mailing envelope, a very strong moth ball mixed with chemicals smell hit me! I'm not sure if it's because they were out on my porch in the heat for a few hours since delivery, but it always makes me leery when I smell that because I wonder where the product was manufactured & WITH WHAT exactly!! They are very nice and soft, DEFINITELY need an insert for support because you are otherwise walking on an uncomfortable flat surface. They are certainly what I would expect for the price - but the jury is still out on whether or not I will keep them. For me - I don't think so - I expected them to stand up a little bit above the knee.  They do in fact go above the knee, but they HUG it, and that is not flattering on a shorter thicker leg like mine. I would have expected made in China, but a check of the website says it's founded in CA, so not quite sure where in fact they're manufactured. But they are definitely cheaply made, certainly as I expected for the price, but if the style was slightly more flattering and/or the smell goes away, I would consider keeping them.  These are the kinds of boots you get that you don't expect to last more than one season, if that, but they stretch the wardrobe and you can potentially get a few pairs and have a few different styles w/o the major $$$. Maybe 1 of my nieces will like them, otherwise they will probably go back, but, I MIGHT try another style from this company if I think it will be more suitable. Do your feet a BIG FAVOR, definitely order a 1/2 size up to add a shoe insert.<br /><br />UPDATE:  DID RETURN THE BOOTS. They didn't fit any of my nieces (2 16's, 17, 20 & 21) & everyone acknowledged that the boots have an extremely narrow foot; & the smell did NOT go away for the few days we had them. If you are lucky enough for these to fit your feet/legs, then as I stated in my initial review, it's good to have as a wardrobe stretcher for certain outfits.  They are not the greatest quality, as the odor immediately reveals, and they are not likely to last all that long.  Woulda if I coulda! But no can do!nitial review, it's good to have as a wardrobe stretcher for certain outfits.

I bought these to wear on our Harley until I could get some sturdy, real leather riding boots.

I need a shoe that is well padded, with a wide toe-box and just enough arch support to feel good - too much arch just hurts my feet. My shoes also have to be affordable, and I must avoid any with memory foam, as I've discovered that I have a sensitivity to it - really an allergic reaction. These shoes feature &#34;yoga mat&#34; soles, are the most comfortable I've found in years, and I can wear them all day without pinched toes or aching feet. I'd been hunting for a new work shoe since Easy Spirit redesigned my old stand-by style, and this is the one - I hope they're available for years to come.

Just as with any shoe, a big part of it is getting the size right.  I wear an 8.5 - 9 depending on the brand.  I got an 8.5 and probably should have gotten a 9.  But they are leather so I wore them around the house at night for a few evenings to stretch them a little before they made their big debut and I LOVE THESE SHOES!  I wore heels every day for over 20 years.  I could run in 4 inch heels, LOL!  Then I got a job where I office from home so I only wear heels a few times a month now.  You and your feet get out of practice.  Now if they aren't comfortable and I have to wear them all day, it's agony.  I can honestly say, if you get your size correct, these very well could end up being the most comfortable heels in your closet!....and did I mention how great they look.  This is a classy shoe!

Only complaint is that the top of the tongue and area around the ankle has stained my white socks with its reddish brown color. It is still happening after two months of wear.<br />UPDATE... Nearly a year later and these boots have held up great. Still at least 6 months of tread left after being on my feet 3-6 miles worth, 40 to 55 hours a week. No holes or tears on the inside fabric. I replaced the laces after 10 months with genuine Danner laces. However...they are STILL staining my socks during hot weather.	2015-08-14

These were the first Asics I kept and am regretting it terribly after walking outside on the trail. When I tested them at home they seemed fine, except for a gripping feel on the ankle even though the size was fine. After walking five miles one day and getting halfway through my walk the following day, the left sneaker began to painfully scrunch the little toes of my left foot. Shortly after, the top of my right foot under the shoe's tongue began to hurt terribly as if something was puncturing my bones. But I looked and nothing seemed to rub anywhere. I am guessing that the shoes were built to correct some foot issue that I do not have, thus making these a misery for me. Which is a shame as they do appear very well made and I don't believe the size was the issue. I have never had such discomfort to the point of hobbling before, and prior to this have been wearing a deteriorating pair of Avias, a far chintzier brand, now held together with band aids on the inside, which even in that condition are way, way more comfortable than the Asics. I don't get why everyone loves these. The comfort and support I was feeling at first quickly wore off and my feet hated them.	2015-08-14

Just got these earlier today, so can't attest to how they feel/hold up after long wear, but they seem very well made and fit true to size.  I actually ordered a half size up based on comments but might order my regular size as well and compare how they fit with the ones I got.  I'm not sure what the commentors who note that the boot is stiff are comparing it against.  I am used to super stiff high quality Frye boots but didn't feel the need to bite the price bullet for the Frye combat boots... these are no more stiff than a normal pair of good boots.  Only difference is that you're dealing with a rubber sole instead of a stacked leather sole.<br /><br />I also have a pair of the Steve Madden Troopa's.  If you've tried those on I would say these run a little bit bigger than those.	2015-08-14

I wouldn't recommend 8 hours in these, but if these hold up like my other two, they are great for a night out...or a night in!<br />The hot pink is gorgeous and will look great with an all black dress or with jeans!	2015-08-14

My husband has been wearing the lace version of these shoes for 5 years.  I ordered the same size (8.5 W)  for these which was perfect.  He likes them so much that he doesn't want any laces any longer.  I've already placed an order for another pair in another color.  Amazon had a great price when I ordered.	2015-08-14

These will not give you arch support if that's what you are looking for.  However, these are meant for skaters or just casual walking.  With that in mind they are very comfortable and stylish.  For the bigger feet out there, they do narrow towards the front so keep that in mind.  A lot of skater shoes do that.	2015-08-14

The shoes were wrapped in the same brand tissue paper and were well protected with wrapping and shoe inserts. The top part of the Easos Geal sandals are beautiful!  That's the only way I know how to describe them! Not only do these sandals come in the Black/Gold, as I have chosen for myself, but they also come in brilliant and bright summer colors, such as: Turquoise Blue, Red, White and Yellow.  I now want a pair in each color!  The fitting of the sandal fits perfect with my size 6 to 6 1/2 inch foot.  They seem to stay on well and have that flat, barefoot feeling.  They are sturdy and seem to hold up well, with an all day wear.<br /><br />***I received a complimentary pair of sandals, in exchange, for my honest opinion and review.  All opinions are solely my own.	2015-08-14

I'm going to have to return these and reorder them in either an 8 1/2 or a 9.  These shoes are cut wide, which I would like in the correct size.  And they have nice toe room. These are lighter than Danskos and the soles are rubber so they provide a nice shock absorber for your feet. After I ordered mine I noticed a fitting guide that helps you decide what size to order. I wish I had seen that before I ordered mine =(.  Anyway,  I'm anxious to try them in my correct size.	2015-08-14

Reviews for shoes can be hard to compare. If you have flat and white feet, then these shoes will support you for experience. That said, I have not exerted them in extreme use.

I cant believe these shoes exist! I also can't believe they are being sold for this cheap! These are without a SHADOW of a doubt the BEST shoes I have ever worn. I had knee problems for over a year and could barely walk 30 mins. Now the knee problems are gone and I can do one hour straight with no issues.I loved them so much I made my friends purchase several pairs after they tried them. I am a very loyal customer to Sketchers and have ONLY worn Sketchers for the past 7 years. The GoPillars technology they introduced in Go Walk 3 makes these shoes easily worth atleast 200 dollars. My friend has flatfoot and wears them and prays for me and thanks me constantly for introducing him to what finally solved his issue. I am very excited to see what Go Walk 4 will be like.<br /><br />Amazing shoes that are extremely under priced and a bargain!	2015-08-14

Since other reviewers said they ran small, I ordered a size 11 when 11s in other brands are way too big. However, they hurt my son's toes the first time he put them on. No biggie. I would just send them back and get the 12s. Uh!  Nope!  The size 11s were $28, but the size 12s were $40. Sorry, I'm not paying that kind off increase ($12) for one size difference. Also, $40 for a 5 year old who will typically grow out of his shoes before wearing them out? I don't think that's wise use of our money.	2015-08-14

However, I feel the need to warn of two things.  One, the size really does run large on these.  You really need to make sure you order 1 FULL size smaller than you normally wear.  Second, these shoes have a very strong chemical odor too them.  I would highly recommend deodorizing them prior to your first wear.  The smell really is bad, trust me.  Other than those 2 small issues, I really like these shoes for the price and would recommend.	2015-08-14

I love the sandals as they are very comfortable so far.<br />I have not had a chance to try them for all day wearing, which is the reason that I didn't give a rating of 5.<br />I love the color and have had compliments on them in the short time that I have worn them (about 2 weeks).	2015-08-14

I wore them a couple times to the office to see how they felt before the trip.  They are very comfortable and don't require much breaking in and they are super lightweight which is nice.  They were easy to pack and didn't take up too much space.<br />A couple things...I almost lost one while swimming a couple yard to shore from the boat, they are not real swim friendly.  Also, once they were wet, the back would rub against my heel and it was not very comfortable. I think the straps would be better as an elastic type material because the Velcro would not stay in place when wet.  Other than that they dried out quickly, stayed surprisingly clean and I am looking forward to wearing them on my hike this weekend.	2015-08-14

I'm keeping them for swollen feet occasions.  One of the biggest features of these shoes is that other stretchy shoes I own &#34;flap/smack&#34; your heal as you walk which is too casual and unprofessional in the work environment.  And,even outside of work, I'd rather not advertise that &#34;I'M HERE!&#34; These shoes are QUIET.  I love them so much that I'm about to order a second pair in my true size.	2015-08-14

The straps hold the sandal on firmly	I bought these shoes for a trip involving canoeing and kayaking. They were absolutely perfect.  The straps hold the sandal on firmly, yet comfortably. Of course, I was able to walk on the rock shores and in the water with no problem.  They dried out great with no change in fit or smell.  I need a good arch support and this provided it.  I didn't wear them hiking, as I was on rocks, etc, and needed protection on the tops of my feet.  I'm not a fan of chunky, athletic-style sandals, so these were a good choice as they are very trim and classy looking.  I wear a 9.5 almost exclusively, except for running shoes where I need an insert, so go up to a 10.  These were a perfect fit.	2015-08-14

A plush, backless slipper	I've been searching for exactly this kind of slipper but it seems the style has gone to the kind with the short heel.  What good is that piece of material anyway?  I just end up smashing it with my heel.  Back to these slippers ... they feel wonderful.  I haven't had occasion to wash them yet but they seem to be well made.  The upper is soft and comfortable inside and the sole is well-cushioned for nearly its full width.  I ordered one pair and came back for the other color as soon as I tried on the first one.  Two weeks later I decided to order another 4 pairs for the future, that's how good they are!  Warning: they run a bit large.  I wear a 10 and had to exchange the 10-11 size for the 8-9.	2015-08-14

The only issue I found with them is that the strap and fabric that goes over the arch of the foot needs a little more forward room and the rear strap that goes behind the heel needs to be shortened just a little.  Whats happening is i can't slide my foot forward enough because of this and while there is plenty of room for the toes, my heel is slightly hanging over the rear of the sandle.  Not much but just enough to notice and cause a little discomfort after they have been on a while.	2015-08-14

The color of these is awesome and I get compliments all of the time. It's why I decided to buy a second pair!<br />These are one step lower than the Paradox, but have similar support. They are very lightweight for a support shoe and are very comfortable. At this point I am not sure if the top of the shoe in the forefront area will be an issue for me, as it is a bit small or there seems to be a rigid piece of the shoe that may prove to be a deal-breaker but is doing okay as of now.<br />Wearing orthotics with this shoe you would have to get a larger size. There is no way it would fit. In addition, I am really feeling the pressure of the top of the shoe where the laces are tied. I have that problem in many shoes where my circulation suffers if it is too tight or presses against my foot wrong on the top nearest the ankle; however, I think buying a longer set of shoe laces and tying them as many runners do, I will add on to my review after I do that and after I go for a run in these. Love them!	2015-08-14

I am on my feet all day (except for right now :o) ) and these shoes are great. I have tried so many different shoes ( Nike Shox, New Balance, some QVC brand and other Nikes ) and these are the best. They really are. I love that I can slip them on and off with no annoying shoe laces. They are super cushy. If anyone has painful feet - you gotta try these out.   Update: 9-11-15  After wearing these shoes for approximately 3 to 4 weeks, I threw them away. My poor feet were KILLING me. I should have never jumped to the &#34;5 Star Rating&#34; as soon as I did. I went out and bought myself another pair of shoes - Nike  Free. So far these are fine. I don't know if I will ever find the right shoe, but what I do know is that those Sketchers were not it.	2015-08-14

Oh god did that fix it. I can now wear them without immediately regretting it.<br /><br />Another thing I saw a lot in other reviews was that there's didn't come in a dr.martens box. My did and they are perfect. You also receive a pair of yellow laces as well as the standard black ones. I would defiantly recommend these for the quality of them and the price. 125$ in stores or 50$ on amazon. Would defiantly suggested you go to a store and try some on before ordering though.

My daughter loves them! She usually wears a size 4, but I got her a 5 (12-18 months) just so she can wear them this fall, but they barely squeeze on her foot now. The pad, or bottom of the shoe fits her foot, but it's hard to get it on. Her foot isn't chubby an is average sized, so I think these shoes are made for smaller feet. The inside is like a soft terry cloth material, and the outside is a fake leather, and is soft and easy to clean. They are warm too. Overall, I like them.

I bought these boots locally as I was concerned about the fit and I wanted to compare the comfort with several different brands.  In every other shoe I own (athletic, dress, etc.) I wear a size 12D.  In these boots a size 12D was very loose.  I could squeeze into an 11D, but the toe box was a little tight on my left foot.  The toe box on boots is rigid and doesn't wear in, so be careful of that.  I went with an 11.5D and it fits great.<br /><br />These boots were much more comfortable out of the box than the Justins that I tried on.  I had really expected to need much more break in time to get them to feel that good.  After a couple days of wear, they wore in and are now the most comfortable boots I have owned.  Also, the quality of these boots in the stitching and materials seems to be much better than the price would suggest.<br /><br />One thing that you will notice with square toe boots is that there are a lot of differences in widths between different boot styles and makers.  I tried on several other pairs that seemed too wide in the toe.  Many of the boots that brands designate as &#34;work boots&#34; tend to be wider and it detracts from the look of the boot in my opinion.  These are not super-wide and look great while still being super comfortable in the toe.<br /><br />Lastly, I went with the distressed leather version of this boot.  They look really great with a pair of jeans.  I tried the other styles of this boot as well as a few pair from Justin.  Without a doubt, these in distressed leather were the best looking pair.  I didn't want a pair of boots that looked like I was headed out to a Western bar, I wanted something that looked like I wore them every day (which I do).  If you want a nice pair of boots that don't look like you are trying to play cowboy dress up, this is a solid choice.	2015-08-14

I've been wearing New Balance shoes for many years because I've always needed wide sneakers. I do like these shoes but I felt they were a little too big. I have always gotten size 7s and these shoes feel like I could have gotten a size 6.5. The first time I ran in them, I was disappointed because my foot was slipping slightly and there was no arch support. I have flexible flat feet and my arches collapse when I walk and run. I bought support inserts and that has helped with the arch problems as well as making the shoe tighter. Overall, the shoe is nice but not great. My last pair were 411s and I used them exclusively for two years (running/walking/hiking) and they only needed extra support inserts recently. Time will tell how these wear.	2015-08-14

Bought these for my first Warrior Dash last fall. AWESOME for that, and for regular street use too. The soles were extremely grippy, even on the Giant Cliffhanger which was slippery with mud from the prior obstacle and my biggest worry on the course. They cleaned off perfectly, and they had been soaked through and through with mud. Instant comfort, fit like a glove the first time wearing them, too. No break-in needed at all, a big shock. I bought maybe a halfsize too large (my size wasn't available but the reviews were just too good). Still the lacing design (those dark bands that extend down from the laces) allows me to tighten not just the laces but the entire uppers comfortably around my feet, but you'd never notice it just looking at them. I wish my size was still available or I'd get another pair today. Solid materials too: the uppers won't wear holes in them or fall apart ever, I don't think. Best shoe I've ever worn.	2015-08-14

They are very comfortable & my daughter can wear them all day.  One pair lasts until almost the end of the year, but by May the strap separates from the velcro.  The first couple of years I used a heavy duty needle & thread to sew the strap back together.  This year I got smart & had a shoe repairman sew the strap with heavy duty thread before school started.  Considering the cost & fit, it's fine with me.  Other shoes have only lasted until January, so these held up pretty well.  If these are just going to be dress up shoes or church shoes, they will last really well.	2015-08-14

She always had a hard time finding items in the bottom of her pocketbook--but especially her cell phone when it started ringing. I was determined to find her a pocketbook that would allow her to organize all her stuff and also one that had a pocket on the outside of her pocketbook so she could grab her cell when it rang. This fit her needs to a tee! She loved it. There are numerous pockets on the outside of the bag so she has everything handy that she uses the most when she is out shopping. Her cell phone is one of those basic flip phones, not a smart phone, so it fit easily into the cell phone pocket. She also loved the strap on the hand bag. The bag is made of leather and should last her a long time. Here is a photo of her with her new pocketbook:	2015-08-14

Adult Men's and Women's Shoe Size Conversion Table<br />https://niceshoes.ca/sizes?q=sizes&nojs=true<br /><br />&#34;... If they have a steel toecap, they will almost always be one size larger than a conventional fit. So for example, if you take a size 9 boot usually, you’ll need a size 8. This isn’t always the case, but it’s true for around 95% of customers, and is only likely to be different if you have a very broad foot AND a very high instep!&#34;<br /><br />I am a size 8.5-9 on my large foot, and size 8.5 on my small foot.  For me, these shoes were 1.5 over-sized for use in hot weather.  Typically, I'll step into a 7.5-8 size boot, and a size 8.5 for sneakers/tennis shoes.  (Absolutely no smaller in sneakers/tennis shoes, as my large foot big toe will easily protrude through the fine clothe.)  In brief, I had to order a size 7 for these shoes.  Even though they are not steel toe, they are still a composite safety toe shoe.<br /><br />The main reason I purchased these, I was getting sick and tired of always buying tennis shoes every six months, which would easily and always wear-out or tear after only six months.  Later I noticed the cloth of my sneakers simply drying-out after a very brief period, and then will tear easily.  Hence, I'm back to leather!  I've had a pair of similar style Corocan boots, which have lated 10 years with only some signs of ageing as of now.<br /><br />I also purchased a pair of Bates Men's Hi Shine Uniform High Shine Oxford, for wearing with some Dickies 874 uniform polyester/cotton blend trousers instead of wearing Levis jeans, for which the jeans also wear and tear too easily.  (The polyester/nylon blended trousers are suppose to wear better or wear-out less easily.)<br /><br />PROS<br />1) Tennis/Sneaker shoe model, but in leather.  This is a standard thick leathered shoe.  No fine leather, or leather that will tear or wear too easy.  (Other models have used fine leathers, with also customers complaining and likely not using Lexol regularly for those fine leathers.)<br />2) Almost as breathable as a tennis/sneaker shoe.<br />3) Almost as light like as a tennis/sneaker shoe.  (Tennis/sneaker is ~11 5/8 - 12 ounces.  These leather shoes are 17 1/4 ounces.)<br /><br />CONS<br />1) Over-sized due to the safety (non-steel) comp toe.  (The safety comp toe is usually standard with most leather boots.)<br />2) Not as light as tennis shoes, but having shoes with thin leather will likely wear-out or tear too easily.  Due care is required of all leather, and the lighter the leather, the less forgiving leather is.  Hence, if you do not wax or Lexol your shoes often, make sure you get thicker leather!<br />3) The arch is a little tight, but will likely wear-in as this is a thick leather shoe.  As such, the arch is probably perfect, I just won't know this for a week or so, or sooner if in hot weather.<br /><br />TIP: If you wear these in hot weather, you might want to step a half size smaller as there's likely no need for thick boot socks.  (Hence, the reason why I went from a size 8.5 to a size 7, instead of a size 7 1/2 for these shoes.)  Colder weather might require boot socks, hence requiring a little extra room for the thicker socks.hable as a tennis/sneaker shoe. 3) Almost as light like as a tennis/sneaker shoe.

These sandals may be the best shoes I've ever owned in this respect (sorry Ugh).  I give them only four stars because I have not been able to get the straps to work well for me.  I adjusted them per the directions, but the extra length on the side was so long it dragged an inch or so on the ground.  I read online this is a common problem and if I cut the extra side strap I would void the warranty, so I ended up tacking the extra side strap in with a thread and needle (I don't think I should have to sew new products).  Also, when I put on the sandals I have to pull hard on the heal strap to get them on (there is no elasticity in the straps).  The result is the the sandals end up strangling my big toes.  I have to readjust the sandals every time after I put them on to keep them from strangling my big toes.	2015-08-14

These are really cute shoes!  The fit seemed a little loose at first, but settled in nicely.  The biggest problem I had with them was the overwhelming dye odor.

Photo id, credit cards, store cards, etc, there are plenty of spaces in two different areas. There is an interior zippered compartment for coins. And there are there separated places inside for for bills, receipts, etc. There is also an additional outside pocket (unsecured) for other slips of whatever. It closes with a snap (my version does). It is pretty heavy duty, almost to a fault. It is thick right out of the box, an inch and a quarter wide at the thickest part before putting anything in. So it only gets bulkier as you fill it. If you have a large bag and size isn't an option, it is comforting to have  something with some girth. If you like a thinner, more compact clutch, I would try the other style that isn't so thick. The print on it is cool but unless there are different spellings from other countries, the clutch spells out Pacefic Ocean (instead of Pacific). Not a big deal but something I notice every time I look at it.<br /><br />It is a wipeable vinyl with the print on most outer areas and a brown interior. Sample provided for review.	2015-08-14

I have been searching and searching for years for a lug sole suede like boot and did NOT want Timberland boots. I was looking to replace a pair of pink suede boots that look just like these and it took FOREVER to find them ( paid 3 times the price 10 years ago for those). I got these in my regular size, not paying attention to EVERY review that said to size up. I should have listened so I exchanged and sized up and they are perfect. And even with sizing up, they make my foot look teeny tiny! And now they are so comfortable. I don't find a problem with the arch support and the back is really nice and cushioned. I will spray with protective spray and quite frankly, at this price, I don't mind if they only last through one or 2 winters, I just wanted the look to wear with jeans and be cute and comfy.  You MUST size up in these but don't worry, your feet will thank you and still look cute and small! I got the cement color and I LOVE them.  The seller was great and the exchange was easy.  I am so pleased and can't wait for fall. I won't only wear them in bad weather, I will wear them with jeans and big oversized sweaters and make my outfit look cute.  I didn't want the look of Timberlands which is why I chose the cement color which is a great neutral and they give some lift and height (even though I'm 5'6&#34;).  I might even get a second pair just to have a back up since it took 10 years to find a cute back up to the pair I was looking to replace.  If you size up, I think you will like these. They are very cute and comfortable.	2015-08-14

Don't get me wrong...they aren't BAD, they just aren't GREAT.<br />What is good about them:<br />Stylish - They are a cute shoe.  The woven material is different and has a nice stretch<br />Pretty comfortable - When you first put them on they do have that, &#34;ahhhhh&#34; factor which lulls you into thinking your feet will have the same reaction after several hours but...not so for me :(  At the end of the day I had slightly achy feet - not like the pain from, oh..4 inch spike heels, but discomfort<br />Decent quality - Pretty well made although I notice that the black wedge sides are made from that type of material that, after some wear, looks like peeling skin from a sunburn.  So far not bad, but then I've only worn them a few times.  We'll see how they wear<br />Pretty cushy insole - Not like thick, memory foam of higher end shoes but decent.  I still always tend to add a medium weight comfort insole to all of my shoes for extra support.<br />Sizing is a bit on the large side - I always order a half size up to be able to fit an extra insole and for room in the toe box but these ran big.  I ended up having to exchange them for the next size down which fit perfect<br />All in all, these are a cute shoe, reasonable price, reasonable comfort but still don't hit the mark for an all day, happy feet Sketchers sort of experience.<br />I will keep them in spite of their short comings and wear them for shorter durations only because they are a bit dressier than the average casual shoe.	2015-08-14

The sole is comfortable but the toe box was narrow and tight. I think Fly London has the right idea on the shoe soles but the sizing and fit is so inconsistent from style to style that  you have to try on a LOT of their shoe styles to find a style/pair that fit well. I want attractive shoes that fit great...and this Fly London style is NOT the comfortable shoe I wear. Wish I had read the other Amazon reviews before I purchased this shoe.	2015-08-14

I will say that they run a tad on the large side.  I usually wear a 10.5 with some shoes going into a 11 so, since I am a wide width, I ordered a 10.5 wide width. The shoes arrived quickly but no matter the type of sock I wore and even with shoe inserts, they were too big. I returned them easily and received my money back within a week. Since they were so comfortable I gave it one last chance and ordered a 10 wide. Perfection! The heel lip is a bit stiff but I wore them for a couple days and that softened out. Even with the stiffness in the heel area, there was no need use mole skin or anything protective while the shoes broke in. I love them so much I ordered a 2nd pair in a different color. I plan on wearing these shoes on a upcoming trip to the UK and I know I will be very comfortable even with all the walking we plan on doing.	2015-08-14

In the end, I can't see spending thousands on a handbag at this time.  Marc Jacobs designed for LV for a while, so I decided to look into his line.  After researching his handbags, I can definitely see his style reflected in his work with LV.  This particular handbag is from a few seasons ago, but it has some of the design elements that I liked in a few of the LV bags, so I went with it.<br /><br />Worth noting:<br />*Overall, I'm very satisfied - though, I wouldn't say this is an equal substitute for an actual LV bag (this is NOT why I took a star off, it is just an observation).<br /><br />*Due to it's design, the base is wider than the top - resulting in an openning smaller than the base.  Given this, I find myself having to feel around my bag to grab something that has made its way into the corners; bags of this shape will all suffer from this to a degree.<br /><br />*It's what I call a &#34;smooshy&#34; bag, meaning it doesn't hold all of its structure like a stiffer bag would when set down.  However, it doesn't deflate and go flat.<br /><br />*A good sized &#34;medium&#34; bag.

I had the right size for my foot, but I do have high arches and this shoe just didn't leave me with enough room. The wrap style of the attached tongue means there is no room to adjust...so if you have high arches, this shoe probably won't work for you. Also, there was a LOT of pinching going on at the joint between my upper foot and my toes...the fabric changes over from being fully flexible to leather right at the bend point which was extremely painful when my foot flexed at all - walking, standing on toes, etc. They definitely could & should have softened that seem for comfort. It's a very pretty shoe with good support, though. For someone with flat, skinny feet - these would be a real gem!	2015-08-14

They don't really fit my feet though. What bothers me is that the tongue is one piece with the shoe, there isn't an opening going down both sides like you would find in older sneakers, it's kind of like a slip-on shoe but with laces over the top. I've noticed this with my daughters Nike's too so I know it's not just a Puma thing. For me this doesn't really work, I have high arches and with a loose tongue I can accommodate my arches by lacing the shoe a little looser towards the top. With these I feel like I'm cramming my foot in and it hurts the top of my foot. I do like the design, the grey with pink accents is cute and they are a nice simple shoe, that's exactly what I wanted. I have worn these out so I can't return them, I thought they might stretch after wearing them but they haven't. I am back to looking for another pair, I just wish that the descriptions would disclose that the tongue is sewn closed. The only other thing that I can think of is maybe cutting the tongue down the side to give me the room I need. I still rated these highly because I think the shoes are good overall. I'm not sure many people will have the same problem that I do, just be warned if you have high arches.	2015-08-14

They were perfect for running as the sole lets you feel the ground. I say &#34;were&#34; because now they are useless. The sole outlasts the fabric on the top thus making the shoes useless.

It's more of a clutch really than an actual handbag.  It's just big enough for a lady to carry around her essential items on a night out on the town.  It fits my iphone 5S perfectly with space for female hygiene items and your favorite lipstick and perhaps a couple of other essential makeup items needed for touch ups.<br /><br />The clutch comes with a removable chain to wear crossbody style as well as a wristlet strap that can be added or removed per your preference.  The material is similar to a patent leather material.<br /><br />Overall, this is a super cute little purse.  Super quirky in style.  It is made pretty well, although I wouldn't want to put it through a lot of wear and tear for fear that it may tear up, but it should be completely able to handle normal wear and tear of normal usage.<br /><br />**  Sample PRovided for Testing & Review	2015-08-14

We are returning the size 11 and would be ordering the size 12.  I can't say enough how beautiful and sturdy these slippers look.  I wished the size was right for both the width and the length (wider and a bit longer).  My husband has a very normal feet for his size.

I absolutely loved these shoes so much that after a couple weeks I ordered two more pairs, since they had been discontinued.

It is right along a line molded into the sole, and with others reporting this issue, I am guess it is why the shoe was discontinued.

Which is surprising, because I have extremely high arches and these shoes provide no arch support whatsoever.  I don't understand how this can be, but I can wear them for eighteen hours with no discomfort whatsoever.  I just believe they've got to be bad for my feet.  Also, I really like a shoe that has a little more height in the heel/sole because I'm only 5' tall and I have trouble reaching lots of things.  So I'm trying to wean myself off of them and find shoes that are a little taller and offer more support.  But they are soft as butter inside and out.  They've also been subject to drenching rainstorm puddles and enchilada sauce accidents to no ill effect.  They can be wiped off quickly with a damp cloth (or dried overnight) and are good to go.  Well worth the money if you don't have prehensile feet!	2015-08-14

The 11 fits well.. another half size maybe an 11.5 would have given me the toe wiggle room I like and would have fit perfect. I can deal with the 11 though as long as my toe nails are trimmed lol. As for comfort the boot feels solid, i wore them for a day to break them in and I have no complaints. Ill be using then this fall in the aderondack mountains for deer hunting so ill revamp my review then. Great price.	2015-08-14

They fit me comfortably right out of the box. I am a fairly solid 10.5 with a wide forefoot and narrower heel. I ordered the size 10, and while my big toe touches the front of the shoe, it is soft and not uncomfortable. I've been wearing these without socks. The arch hits me in exactly the right spot, and the moccasin stays nicely positioned on my foot when I walk. I have a high arch and instep. These fit and feel heavenly on my feet, which are not easy to please!  I think a size 11 would be too big, but I would go that route if I wanted to wear these with thick socks.	2015-08-14

I doubt this purse would work if you are looking to use it as a shoulder bag all the time, unless you have very wide shoulders, because the strap is wide. I suggest to the makers that the next model of this purse be made with a tapered strap. But since I wear the purse across my body, it works well for me.	2015-08-14

These shoes look exactly like they do in the picture but would look even better if the material used was not material and actually fabric. It is this synthetic leather that does not match with anything even if its color coordinated with the shoes because the shoes have a shiny exterior which makes it awkward to wear in my opinion (THE LOOK OF THE SHOE IS PERFECT THOUGH IF NOT FOR THE MATERIAL USED). The buckle-like chains on the sides of the shoes open up and the shoe lace slides out which is stupid and absolutely irritating to say the least. These shoes are what you would expect from a bargain item, but even saying that is a lie because I have bought a pair of other bargain shoes for almost the exact price as these and they look and feel ten fold better than these ever will. I never wore these after the second time because uncomfortable they are, they are now in a dump somewhere because I threw them out.	2015-08-14

Unfortunately, I could no longer find any 9's anywhere in my size so I made the jump to the 10's. I thought at first that I just needed to break them in, but after a couple of weeks I was noticing more and more pain in my foot - specifically the joint where my big toe and foot meet.  Now I am on the hunt for a new brand/style of running shoe. I want the Inspire 9 back. :(	2015-08-14

They even send a few extra sparkles to glue onto your shoes because you will knock some off. They were packaged nicely and arrived fast. I have a solid size 9 foot. These fit. So I would say they are true to size. I did'nt give them five stars for the reason that they bend my foot in an uncomfortable way. Just like Barbie's foot. There is no padding and the point of the shoe narrows to the point that my toes rub on the shoe. I wouldn't wear these for long periods I wouldn't be able to. I think they are great date night shoes. A little dress up bling. I would not wear them to an all day event or if I had the kids with me. With that said I do like the shoe. They seem like they have been well put together so I am not disappointed in them, I will just be selective about where and when I wear these shoes.	2015-08-14

I am picky about shoes, and will say that these were comfortable out of the box. However, this is definitely a summer shoe, as it is mostly a padded mesh fabric. The sole is very soft, and you can really feel everything you step on.  Grip is good, but I have never squealed so much in any other shoe... But I do walk a little weird. They ware wearing a little prematurely on the inside though...	2015-08-14

My 11month old son's foot measures 5 inches and I got the 18-24month size, which fit nicely. A little more room to grow but not that much.  He only wore Robeez with the super soft sole, so was a little freaked out by these sandals and cried and pointed at his feet lol after the shock wore off, he started to walk around and seems to like these shoes now.

These were purchased for my 12 year old daughter for tumbling and cheer squad. It is hard to find cheer sneakers in her size since many in store brands stop at adult size 6. We took a chance as online show purchase is a gamble but lucked out with great quality, as pictured, comfortable cheer/tumbling shoes. She was VERY happy with the selection of multi-colored laces. This is helpful to keep with the color scheme of teams / schools, etc. Good support in the arch, well made, will last a long time. To be honest, even if not for cheerleading, these are great sneakers for athletics in general.	2015-08-14

I'm in LOVE with these shoes! They are very lightweight, airy and crazy comfortable! Before I bought these, I saw them at JCPenney and tried on a 9.5. I thought, perfect! My size! WRONG! These shoes are big! After reading the reviews they said to order a whole size down! So I ordered a size 8. I was worried that they wouldn't fit.. but they're perfect! When they came to my house I noticed on the inside of one of the shoes, the 'sole' or the bottom was not intact or sewn to the shoe. So I thought that they were suppose to intentionally be taken out for washing or something. But the other shoe wasn't like that. Overall, they're awesome!	2015-08-14

I started wearing them regularly two months ago. The coatings on the lenses have failed badly, bubbling up and completely ruining the view through them. Checking now to see what people have posted about Oakley customer service, it appears that there is zero chance that they will make good on the product. Typical reports are that Oakley takes months to as much as 9 months on these types of things, and demands typically $100. Even with very recently purchased sunglasses developing a lens defect or any kind of defect, I did not see a single case of Oakley repairing free. I no longer believe in this company at all and will never purchase another Oakley product. I have had cheap sunglasses last through far more wearings than these expensive ones have. Absolutely positively, they were exposed to nothing that can explain their failure. They were just badly made.	2015-08-14

I have high arches and have long been loyal to Asics, both for running and for casual tennis shoes. I never had any reason to try another brand, until Amazon Vine presented the opportunity for me to try these awesome Mizuno Wave Enigma 5 shoes for free. &#34;BLOWN AWAY&#34; are two words that best summarize my experience so far with these shoes.<br /><br />**POSITIVES**<br /><br />+ Style/Appearance: My Asics aren't much for beauty contests, but these Mizunos are lookers, for sure. I love the metallic blue trim, as well as the yellow midsole. Of course, you'll love the color coordinated laces that you will, unfortunately, never find again when time to replace.<br /><br />+ Comfort Beyond Compare: I cannot tell a lie. These are more comfortable than any other running shoe I have ever worn. They are amazing--ample arch support, incredibly soft cushioning, snug but not tight fit, super soft tongue, somewhat stretchy/elastic laces, supple/luxurious sock liner (could wear barefoot!), and perfect width for normal feet (no too wide or too narrow areas).<br /><br />+ Excellent Breathability: I've worn these for extended periods in warm weather, and the cooling from the breathable mesh material is outstanding. I've never had the urge to get them off because they are too hot, and I am the kind of guy who is always taking off his shoes.<br /><br />**UNSURE/NEGATIVES**<br />It's truly difficult to nitpick on these shoes. In the early going, they seem virtually flawless, but here's my attempt at finding fault.<br /><br />- Yellow Midsole Difficult to Clean: These shoes are so beautiful that you'll find yourself trying to keep them pristine. I have the nasty habit of using one shoe to kick off the other by placing the toe of one shoe on the heel of the other. DOH! I dirtied up the bright yellow midsole, and I was so bummed, especially since I could not get it clean with a wet rag. Perhaps I will try a mild detergent, but the typical wet rag isn't doing it.<br /><br />- Extra Laces Please: I know it isn't industry practice, but when you are paying for top-of-the-line running shoes (I got to try these for free, to be clear), it doesn't seem like too much to ask for an extra pair of the perfectly coordinated laces to be in the box. These laces are to die for, both in color match and in performance with their stretchy/elastic feel.<br /><br />- Somewhat Long Laces: I haven't used the extra ankle-tightening laces hole eyelets at the very top yet, which would help, but these laces do seem quite long. With their stretchiness, I found that I needed to have really big loops when I tied them at the top in order to avoid my laces hitting the ground. Not a huge deal, but I am trying to nitpick virtually perfect shoes!<br /><br />Durability will be tested with possible future updates to this review, as I have less than a month on these. So far, they are holding up wonderfully.<br /><br />Overall, it's tough not to LOVE these shoes, and love them I do. Trying is believing. I never expected I'd be won over, given my past loyalty to Asics.s Please: I know it isn't industry practice, but when you are paying for top-of-the-line running shoes (I got to try these for free, to be clear), it doesn't seem like too much to ask for an extra pair of the perfectly coordinated laces to be in the box.

The first thing I noticed upon unboxing them was that they seem bigger than other ASICS (like the Gel-1000 2 or the Gel-2000 3).  They are built thicker and seem to be &#34;stouter&#34; than the standard road-runners.  The tread is perfect for off-road mix with plenty of traction.  They also have tones of cushy padding in the soles.  I love these trail-runners, they may be the best I've owned to date.	2015-08-14

Came back to Florida and ordered up a pair for shiggles. Though I prefer sandals these are the most comfortable closed shoes I have ever worn. Fairly durable, super easy to slip on and off, lightweight. They can't pass for dress shoes with a straight face (though I try) but they go great with shorts or khakis or jeans or almost any casual paint. I went with a neutral camel color and they match darn near everything. I really like the way the threads are untrimmed around the stitching. Gives the entire shoe a &#34;Here's what I think about your dorky dress code, Pal&#34;  counterculture flair. Then again, maybe some dude at the factory just forgot to trim them.	2015-08-14

Also, I had originally bought the whole upper was leather and was excited to get a well priced leather shoe, but when it came, I realized that all it stated as having was a leather insoles. However, the top insole was fabric so it was hard to ascertain if the insole underneath really was leather. The shoe itself was also very distinctively imitation leather with the smell that comes along with it and did not seem sturdy enough to withstand some good ole little boy abuse. They were a cute shoe though - wish they would have worked out well for us.	2015-08-14

I bought this shoe to go with a Cinderella inspired running outfit for a Disney race.  I loved the color!  When I tried them on, I was amazed at how awesome they felt on my feet!  There is a lot of support and I felt a spring to my step.  I wore them on 3 practice runs (2.5 miles each) and noticed I was able to run longer and a little faster in this Saucony shoe, as compared to my cheaper running shoes.  The top is mesh, so my feet can breathe in the hot, Florida summer!  Also, I usually wear an 8-8.5 in flats, but I purchased a 9 in this shoe to give a little room while running.  They fit perfectly!	2015-08-14

Get some padding for whatever part(s) of your foot they start to irritate, or wear thick socks for the first few times. I've been breaking these guys in and my heels have cuts on them because I was wearing low-rise socks, haha. This is my second pair and I've had issues with both. After a week, they're damn comfortable and last for years.<br /><br />The blood isn't even the reason I'm giving these guys four-stars instead of five. The trouble is that the insole of the shoe (it's a dark/medium blue) stained my white socks. I'm sure this is 100% similar to what happens with new denim jeans. Sperry TS should find a way to wear out the insole before putting it in the shoe. Beyond that, this is a great sperry. It's pure white (don't get the 'Ice,' if you want 'White.' Get 'White')	2015-08-14

Likely order the next size smaller for your shoe size.	Although these shoes are not advertised as having a safety composite toe, I can see some characteristics of this shoe having some sort of minimal safety composite toe.  As such, shoe sizing likely will be considered according to the following:<br /><br />Adult Men's and Women's Shoe Size Conversion Table<br />https://niceshoes.ca/sizes?q=sizes&nojs=true<br /><br />&#34;... If they have a steel toecap, they will almost always be one size larger than a conventional fit. So for example, if you take a size 9 boot usually, you’ll need a size 8. This isn’t always the case, but it’s true for around 95% of customers, and is only likely to be different if you have a very broad foot AND a very high instep!&#34;<br /><br />I am a size 8.5-9 on my large foot, and size 8.5 on my small foot. For me, these shoes were at least one size over-sized for use in hot to mildly cold weather. (ie. Light dress socks) Typically, I'll step into a 7.5-8 size boot, size 8 dress shoe, and a size 8.5 for sneakers/tennis shoes. (Absolutely no smaller in sneakers/tennis shoes, as my large foot big toe will easily protrude through the fine clothe.)  In brief, I had to order a size 7 for these shoes.<br /><br />PROS<br />1) Good standard dress oxford shoe.<br />2) I love the soles, as they provide good cushion as well as good traction!<br />3) Does not requiring constant care. (These shoes seem to have a vinyl coated leather?  You'll apparently see vinyl coated leather used for leather vehicle seats.)<br /><br />CONS<br />1) Although apparently properly sized now at a size 7M and I do not think I require a size 7 wide, they're still a little uncomfortable for continuous walking.  In other words, they're not like jogging or running shoes.  Updated several weeks later, these shoes are more comfortable now after inserting a very cheap inner sole below the original sole.  Also, just using Lexol and wearing regular cotton socks for the past weeks has also seemed to help break these shoes in... or my feet.  Likely just the sole needs to break in just right for parts of the foot to not rub against parts of the upper shoe?<br />2) A pair of Allen Edmonds shoes may still be more comfortable?<br /><br />TIP: If these are vinyl coated leather shoes, from my research on the Internet, they still need leather cleaner, leather conditioner and shoe polish/wax.  People have stated the conditioner will eventually absorb, as vinyl coated leather is still somewhat porous.<br /><br />TIP: The composite toe and heal can be further broken in by manually creasing the material with your hands.foot to not rub against parts of the upper shoe? 2) A pair of Allen Edmonds shoes may still be more comfortable?

They go well with jeans or khakis--anything casual or business dress.  The only problem I had was while taking them off, I grabbed the heel and pulled and instead of the shoe coming off, the heel came off!  It was held onto the sole with five tiny nails.  I was able to hammer the heel back on, but really, should I have to do that?  I have worn them several more times since then.  When it comes time to removing them, I now loosen the laces first.  It is a little more of a problem since I ladder-lace them, but the heel at least has remained on.  The boot leather is soft and pliable.  Try not to wear them in bad weather though.  These shoes are not meant for rugged wear.	2015-08-14

They hold up well, esp. for the price. And, my footing feels secure & stable. When new the leather repelled paint & just pelled off when dry -- not so much now. The sizing seems consistent with my other shoes & boots. I got a half size larger then my normal shoe size & I'm glad I did because with thick socks they fit just right.	2015-08-14

I attend college full time and either have to carry a purse and a book bag, or remember to grab my wallet from my purse and stick it in with my books.

This purse is the perfect size to act as a small purse, or to fit into my larger purse/book bag. It also is large enough to hold my ZTE ZMAX cell phone, a lipstick and my gift card holder.	2015-08-14

This is a late review.. but here it is:<br /><br />I ordered size 8, but they contacted me a few days later to tell me that they do not have size 8 anymore. I usually wear size 7.5 to 8.5 so I went with 7.5 instead of 8.5 because it would be better to have slightly smaller than to have slightly bigger size of running shoes. When I got the product, I realized it isn't the right size for me. I wish I could have just canceled the order when they told me they didn't have the right size. The shoe soles were way thin/light for me, and it honestly feels like wearing a sock shaped of a shoe. I don't wear this anymore, but I mean.. if I didn't have my other Nike sneakers that I bought after this order, I would wear this for emergency purposes (as in working out, not actual emergency) or jobs that would get my sneakers wet/dirty (rowing). FYI, the black part is a mesh-like material, so it kind of shines.<br /><br />This is just my personal opinion, so don't feel like this wouldn't be a good product for you; if you like lightweight sneakers and have narrow feet, go for it dude.	2015-08-14

The inner sole of the shoe is very soft pillow-like and it adds up to the fact that the actual surface of the insole is almost similar to a flat shoe, in terms of how much support you foot needs. The only complaint is that the shoe is somewhat large, I wear 35.5 EU and my usual perfect fit is 5.5. I ordered a 5 and I need an insert for the shoe to s*** perfectly. However I have decided I will keep the shoe because I can rarely find a heel so comfortable, not to mention I can wear it with virtually anything, it could easily match a skirt or a pair of jeans, be those skinny or bootcut. Love it	2015-08-14

I'm glad I ordered half a size down, as any larger might have been too large. They fit perfectly (half a size down) and are very cute. The leather is not treated with anything, however, so any little drop of water or even touching w/ fingers too much causes discoloration. The heel rubbed a bit at the top but I suspect that they will soften w/ wear.<br /><br />I knew what I was getting w/ a flat sandal like this and especially since I was wearing them to a wedding, though my feet did hurt pretty badly the next day. Bare feet would have been better for the long amount of time spent dancing.	2015-08-14

They should not call these &#34;slip on&#34; because you have to use a shoe horn or your finger to keep the back straight when you put your heel into the slipper.  A slipper more like a clog that has a very low back would be a &#34;slip on&#34; since you can literally slip your foot into it.  That will be my next purchase to replace these for the really warm summer days and nights.	2015-08-14

I love these shoes, but I thought they were men's sizes when I ordered, since they showed up in my search for men's shoes =\  I also heard they ran small, so I ordered up according to men's sizing.  However, they actually fit a little bit small since they are women's sizing.  No big deal, they're still pretty comfortable.  I know if I had ordered my correct women's size, they would have been perfect.  Very stylish shoe, and I love the extra set of laces in gold :)	2015-08-14

I wear them daily for work, as well as do outdoor activities in them. For work and casual use, fine boot, pretty boot. For hiking/backpacking, dont buy them. Esp. for the price, you can get a much, much more durable boot. The soles are soft. Good for comfort, not for feeling every rock on the trail.	2015-08-14

Recent studies suggest that the best way to choose a shoe is to simply find one that fits your foot and that you find comfortable. The Wave Inspire is that shoe for me--I have slightly narrow feet and the shoe fits perfectly. It also gives enough cushion without being too cushioned. I pronate a bit (not extreme) and the shoe handles that, well, in stride (sorry could not resist the terrible pun).<br /><br />My only compliant with this shoe (and Mizuno shoes in general) is that the soles seem to wear faster than other brands.	2015-08-14

I initially though that it may be a touch too small when I read the measurements but it's great.  It is really slouchy so if you like structure this is not for you.  But because it has so much give I can really pack it full when I need to.  The shoulder bag to backpack conversion is really easy and is never cumbersome to convert back.  My one really minor issue is that the two front pocket zipper pulls clink together when you walk.  I wish they zipped the same directions so the pulls didn't touch.  The front snap pockets are pretty tiny but they do hold a charging cable for your phone/iPod pretty well.  I've used it every day for the last couple of weeks and there is no immediate indication that this bag will fall apart anytime soon. I would def. recommend this bag.	2015-08-14

After a bit of time to break in (a bit more than a week for me), the boots feel fine for casual activities.

They fit great, weren't painful between my toes and looked super cute. Unfortunately, about 3 weeks after getting them and only a hand full of times of wearing them they fell apart. Maybe the glue they used to glue the toe section into the sandal was no good. Sadly for that reason they only get a 2/5 stars.	2015-08-14

I love the large compartment and multiple inside pockets. The bag is rather stiff, so it keeps its frame when I set it down, which I like, as opposed to a saggy bag.

My granddaughter is 17 months old and a size 5 infant/toddler shoe.  I ordered the large which is a 5/6.

Clarks shoes usually fit okay.  The problem was the left shoe was darker in color than the right shoe.  It makes me wonder if these were perhaps &#34;seconds&#34; from Clarks and maybe that is why they are a little less than when you purchase directly from Clarks.  I usually buy from QVC but they did not have the color or size I needed. One suggestion to the company selling these shoes:  BE HONEST WITH PEOPLE AND TELL THEM UP FRONT IF THESE ARE SECONDS!!!!!	2015-08-14

I saw these boots on Amazon and had to have them to wear with my skinny jeans.  When I received them, they were absolutely gorgeous and appeared to be quality - well made.  I ordered a half size down based on other reviews, and they were spot on.  The boots were actually quite comfortable.  My only issue was this: I am a petite person (5'2&#34;) and at the 8&#34; boot shaft length with the ultra-low cut in the front, they made my calves look HUGE and made me look even shorter - kind of like I was playing cowgirl dress up - which isn't too cool on a 40-something woman.  However, these would look awesome on someone with really long legs in a mini skirt or shorts, but sadly, I had to box them up and send them back, cute fringe and all.  I gave them 5 stars - because these are still gorgeous boots, regardless of the fact that I'm too short.	2015-08-14

US	46064344	RWO7HII7SN8OF	B00KZQ40BY	769882050	Prince Men's Viper VII Mid Tennis Shoe	Shoes	4	0	0	N	N	"The only \"mid\" tennis shoe that works for me"	As others mention, there are few &#34;mid&#34; tennis shoe options out there. These are my third or fourth pair of mid Vipers (various generations). These accommodate my orthotics AND have the wide toe box I need. Nothing else works for me. I wish they were more aesthetically pleasing (the trend seems to be they are getting worse, not better). I suspect Prince does not feel they sell in enough volume to justify a second color scheme--and that they keep the styling conservative because the average age of wearers is 35/40/45+?<br /><br />I've worn them about a year; recreational play on hard courts once or twice a week. I think I'm about ready for another pair, as the tread is getting pretty worn on left shoe from dragging my toes.<br /><br />I pair these with thick Thor-Lo socks.<br /><br />[Side note: I exchanged emails with people at Prince corporate as I waited for this current model to come out--my old ones were very worn and I was growing anxious they had discontinued the Viper. It was a long wait, but they did finally release this Viper VII (out of a new factory, which was part of the delay). I was impressed by the quick response of the corporate rep.]	2015-08-14

The pros outweigh the one con. I thought synthetics were lighter weight than leather but this bag is soooo much heavier than any of my other bags, leather or vinyl. I use it as a commuter bag so it's chocked full of my stuff which makes it even heavier. And being so full it sags on the bottom. I guess I've kept and used it so much because of the size and three inside accessory pockets, perfect for phone, lip stuff, sunglasses. I'm shopping for a new bag and will be noting shipping weights.	2015-08-14

I knew they needed to be mine as soon as I saw them.<br />The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the fringe.  Some of these leather strands are super frail.  A few of mine were loosely knotted and uneven (dragging the floor even), so I tugged gently on them to tighten the knots so that they would lie flatter to the side of the bootie and be straighter, but some of them BROKE off.  And one was already snapped off when I took them out of the box.  Because there are other strands it SORT OF hides this and I didn't want to deal with sending them back, so I'm just dealing with it.<br />Another plus is that these are really comfy considering they aren't support shoes :)  I can wear them to my office job all day without them hurting me.	2015-08-14

Best-fitting trail shoes I've ever had. Nice, big toe box, without it being ridiculously over-sized like Altras. Stable, comfortable. Did two 20+ mile trail races in these, plus lots of long, rocky training runs, and never any blisters or problems. Cushioning is decent, but you can still definitely &#34;feel the trail&#34;, and in fact, I'm now running in Scarpa Ignites, because I wanted a bit more cushion. One criticism is that they didn't last very long--started to fall apart around 275 miles (stitching on side) and then a big gash on the bottom forced me to retire them at 300 miles. Was hoping to get at least 100 more miles out of them. Love the Ignites so far, and will review them after I see how long they hold up.	2015-08-14

These adorable Bobux maryjanes are perfect for my 5 year-old daughter who has narrow, sensitive feet.  The leather is buttery soft, there is padding all around the ankle, and an arch-support cushiony insole.  The rubber soles are also very flexible and durable.  She's had them for over 6 months and wears them often to run around at the playground and ride her scooter and they are still showing very little signs of wear!  The toe area has gotten scuffed, but I just add a little navy polish and they're good as new.  I highly recommend them!  Great quality and true to size (although slightly narrow).	2015-08-14

Ordered these because of the reviews.  When they arrived I wore them around the house and they were REALLY comfortable.  The true test was hiking and walking in the water.  These are NOT good water shoes for nature hikes!  The soles are too thin and walking on pebbles was painful.  They fit great, were comfortable, and held up well, but I couldn't walk on gravel roads with them.  I would recommend these shoes for the pool or beach, but not hardcore outdoor use.  I did wash them on gentle twice since buying them and they held up fine.  The insoles came unglued, but I just shove them back in.	2015-08-14

After receiving it, I tried it on and could not squeeze my feet into them because they were too small.  I normally wear a size 7 but these were probably a 6.5.  I really didn't want to take a chance on returning and repurchasing them in a larger size since I didn't want to be disappointed again.

I read the reviews before I purchased, and had this in my 'wish list' for quite a while before I took the plunge.<br /><br />All of the reviews were correct on this one! The feel of the purse is nice (not real leather, but not cheap feeling either), it seems sturdy and like it will last, and also it is smaller than I expected. I know they provide measurements, but I was looking at the picture of the dummy with it, and expected a larger purse-- read the measurements!! I can barely fit my tablet in there, and there isn't as much room as I was expecting.<br /><br />There is a slight chemical smell, and a few scratches on some of the hardware... I thought about docking a star for that, and the sizing- but realized that it's not enough of an issue for me and I really do adore this purse.<br /><br />I bought it in the coffee color, and it's just fantastic. Today is my first day with it, it's 10am, and I've gotten 2 compliments on it... I call that a victory!	2015-08-14

They fit great right out of the box. In my line of work I'm around a lot of oil, grease, harsh chemicals and harsh weather. They have held up well in every way. Normally I am so rough on my boot I have to replace them by the 6 month mark, sometimes sooner.<br />They are serious about being waterproof too! I SOAKED them washing some equipment last week and didn’t even realize it. My socks were totally dry and my toes nice and toasty warm. I bought these just for work but I love them so much I find that I’m wearing them at home also. I don’t need safety toe at home but they are so comfy I find myself reaching for these instead of my other shoes. I will be buying another pair when these finally wear out but by the looks of them I should have at least another 6 months. That’s amazing for me; if you are not hard on your boots these things will last you forever.	2015-08-14

The arch support is so-so for my high arches: It only supports the outer arch, while the inner part of my arch and metatarsal do not have any support. All in all, this shoe was not comfortable enough to keep, despite the low price.<br /><br />FIT: I am usually between 6.5 and 7, and my foot measures between 9 and 1/8 and 9 and 1/4 inches long. The ball of my foot is somewhat wide. I chose the size 7, and it was just right in length.<br /><br />These would be fine for someone with slightly lower arches or flatter feet, as well as narrower feet.	2015-08-14

The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars, is the shoe size.  It is not compatible with the size chart of Amazon. My normal shoe size is 9D (M) and I ordered this size, but it was small.

Wrong. The front of my foot couldn't even fit inside the clog. However, since these are quite affordable compared to other hospital shoes, I decided to order a size up. This time I could fit my foot into the shoe, but the shoe entrance is so tight, that my foot cannot get deep enough the shoe for my heel to fit on. The shoe is definitely long enough as I can feel space in front of my toes, but I can feel circulation being cut off at the entrance to the shoe and my heel slips out with every step. Super annoying.BTW, I don't wear wide shoes, so this isn't an issue of not ordering the wide size. I can only presume these are intended for skeletor feet.	2015-08-14

These look great, however in the medical/dental field I am on my feet and running around a good amount of time throughout my 10+ hour days. These shoes are SO incredibly uncomfortable and do not flex at all, even with trying to break them in prior to use at work! I have BRUISES on top of my feet where these sit!!! They are stubborn as all heck and won't hardly budge or flex when walking. Also, the bottom broke apart by the toe (mind you I wore these LESS than 5 hours). I could get about an hour in these shoes and had to constantly be taking them off throughout the day. They would be quite comfortable if I could just get past how stiff they are. Would not recommend, or if you want to spend forever trying to break these in I would go a size bigger. Save yourself from being in so much pain!<br /><br />Update: I have had these maybe a little over a month and they have hardly broken in. I have tried breaking them in and wearing them around the house before and on my feet over 10 hours a day they're still stiff. I have permanent numbness on the tops of my feet where they lay. They are also cracking on the tops AND the bottoms have fallen apart. Would not recommend, especially in the medical or dental field	2015-08-14

Have always worn New Balance shoes, 30+ years now, and as earlier reviews have mentioned the fit in this shoe just isn't quite right.  I always wear the same size in New Balance athletic shoes but that size in this shoe feels different -- as earlier mentioned by others, the toe box feels smaller/shorter (and I wear a Wide fit).  However, the shoe itself is comfortable for exercise walks and easy runs and the price was right (perhaps so cheap because of the sizing issue?).  The liner could provide more arch support but that I'll fix with new arch supports when the liners in these wear out.  Nice and light, great cushioning.  But if I had paid more than 1/2 price I would have returned them given the fit issue.	2015-08-14

The texture of the shoe gel has always had a nice sponge-like feel.  When I first bought these flip flops for the sake of having them, I was a bit surprised how stiff they felt.  It didn't seem to have the ordinary crocs feel, but I gave it a shot and tried it out.<br /><br />I was surprised how addictive they felt.  Just like most crocs, the tiny stitching on the bottom have nice stimulus to the bottoms of my soles, and made my feet feel they were not wearing anything, while protecting normally weary and calloused feet.  Have been doing more Fitbit steps than I ever imagined wearing these slippers.  I had a heel blister from wearing sneakers several days ago, so was forced to use these flip flops even more.Yesterday I went 66000 steps and could've went more if I had a little more time in the day.  I swear by these. I have never comfortably put up Fitbit numbers like the ones I am getting without these slippers!  Forget running sneakers, I will be running a marathon in these!!!	2015-08-14

I bought them for my son and in the football print because football season is starting soon and besides, brown is a nice neutral color in general. I received them quickly and was pleasantly surprised with the packaging. It comes in it's own box so gifting would be a breeze. Looking at the shoes, they look well made. I don't think it will break with normal wear and tear. Although it is not real leather, the material is soft. I like how the inside of the shoe is terry lined. That means no socks are needed and the terry will absorb any sweat. The terry means it's also going to be soft against your baby's foot. The side panels stretch so you can easily put baby's foot in the shoe. I bought them in size 9-12 months and they fit my baby's foot good and he'll be turning 11 months next week. The bottom sole is rubber, I initially thought it was plastic but it's actually rubber. This is good news as my child can wear these shoes on carpet, tile, wood, and any other surface and I don't have to worry about him slipping. I am so impressed with these shoes that I a going to purchase another pair in green (the zebra design). I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.	2015-08-14

I have been buying these shoes for 5 years now and the last pair I ordered skinned the toe (leaving a grey mark) the first day my daughter wore them. My daughter is so much easier on her shoes now as compared to when she was younger. They have obviously changed how these shoes are made. They are not made with the same materials they once were. Might possibly be why Stride Rite stopped carrying them in their stores. I'm super disappointed because this was always my go-to, best made shoe for my daughter. Do not waste your money on these cheap shoes, they are no better than the ones you can purchase at Target.	2015-08-14

Over 5 days we hiked about 40 miles on pretty challenging terrain, and they handled it really well for the most part. The soles of the shoes did not have very good traction on wet rocks or gravel, but they were good otherwise. They're very comfortable, but I would recommend either long thick socks, or forgoing these for the waterproof boots. These were not very waterproof (didn't realize I had ordered the mesh ones) and although they were comfy I got blisters on both heels even from short hikes because of the height of the backs of the shoes. Despite this, I think these shoes are a decent option, especially for the price.	2015-08-14

I have had seven pairs from the Sense Ultra 3s to the Fellraisers and even the Quest 4D GTX boots. I bought the Sense Pro because Solomon says it was based off of the Sense Ultra 3 S-labs but they were made for more of the urban to trail type stuff. I am away from the trails for a couple months so this seemed like a good fit.... Nope, the shoe looks the same but that is about where things end. My major complaint with this shoe is high heel to toe. Coming from the Ultra 3s or a fore foot running shoe these things feel like sketchers. Next the race lace pocket falls under the laces when tightened making it a chore to fit the loose end into the pocket. The lace eyes are already fraying. Over all It just doesn't feel like my foot is in the shoe, it feels more like I am on top of the shoe. BTW I have about 100 miles on the shoes.	2015-08-14

Let me say that I thought that I would like this bag because so many others had left reviews indicating they liked this bag, but taste is individual.<br /><br />I will say I like the layout of the bag, it's roomy and has many different pockets to help you organize your things. But I don't care for the pleather material its made from, it's rigid and shiny and looks very inexpensive. The interior fabric also feels very rough and the zippers are inexpensive.<br /><br />I was given a sample product in exchange for an honest review and I have to be honest, I'm sorry but don't like the bag.	2015-08-14

First Impression-  After a week of wear, I love these boots.  Very quick break-in, and very comfortable out of the box. In the first week I have soaked them in water, trudged through concrete slurry while pouring a foundation, walked several miles, and have worked in rainy weather as well as hot, sunny weather.  My feet feel great at the end of the day...not too hot and never wet (socks are moist from sweat, but not soaked).They feel like a hiking boot, allow for a natural stride on account of the perfect flex point in the shank and built in toe rocker, the tread is excellent and grips very well on a variety of surfaces, the lacing system is effective and efficient, and the Keen-dry membrane is waterproof and very breathable.  Build quality is excellent.<br /><br /> Other reviewers have mentioned the overly padded tongue, but I don't find it to be thicker than the tongue on other boots I have owned.  I can't speak on durability, but if the longevity of my last pair of Keen shoes are any indication of the durabilty of these boots, I expect a good year of hard wear out of them.  I am a building contractor and wear my boots all day, every day.  I will update after a few months of wear.	2015-08-14

I've worn them probably 60-70 times between last summer and this summer, and taken very good care of them (e.g., storing in their box when not wearing). Today, the cork around both heels started cracking and crumbling -- a big chunk fell off one and the other seems to be headed in the same direction. They otherwise look nearly new. I have not worn them in the rain or abused them in any way. So disappointing. I've seen reviews on line that some Dansko clogs have problems with crumbling soles, but this is the cork (or &#34;cork-like&#34;) material. They are now unwearable. I would expect Danskos to last for YEARS. Sadly, I have a 2nd pair in another color...worn less...now I'm afraid to wear them because who knows when/where they will fall apart.	2015-08-14

They're relatively lightweight and breathable and fit pretty well. For just walking around, I'm sure they'd be fine.<br /><br />As a running shoe, however, they leave a LOT to be desired. There is virtually no cushioning at all and the support is nonexistent. It's a bit like running in shoes that are nothing but a piece of cardboard. The flexion is good, but I feel every step when my foot hits the ground. If you're getting these to run/jog in, you'll likely be disappointed.	2015-08-14

It finally came time to replace the navy pair, among other reasons, because the footbed liner started curling up a little at the edges.  Decided to buy both a pair in blue and a pair in white.  Unfortunately, the new ones are nowhere as good as the ones they replaced:  The position of the piece that goes b/w my toes is different (further back from the front edge) than the old ones, and the bumps that used to be under the toe area are gone, so they're simply not as comfortable.  Also, the footbed liners on both pairs lifted & bunched up the 2nd (white pair) and 3rd (blue pair) time I wore them (even though they didn't get wet).  Very disappointed.	2015-08-14

They are heavier; bigger in width; made with a thicker, cheaper plastic with rough edges that pull my hair, and they don't fit my face - the arms are thicker and straight and don't curl around my ears causing the glasses to fall very low on my nose.

After failing to find any last year, I needed some for a trip to Florida this summer and thought that I was settling for these, despite the great reviews.  While nothing like what I thought I was looking for, I am totally satisfied with them.  Teva is now my go-to sandals.  When these need to be replaced in a couple of years, I will be looking at another pair. One caution: be careful of permitting the Velcro closures from contacting the fabric straps of the sandal because it will pull threads from the woven webbing causing them to pill and become fuzzy.	2015-08-14

Overpriced, not really that comfortable, and not worth the money.  You're paying for the name not the quality.  I suppose someone has to pay for those hot Reef models.	2015-08-14

They looked great, and, having wanted to buy a pair of this brand for a while, I bought them because they were at a great price. Unfortunately, as other reviews had mentioned, they can run a bit large. This pair was about 1 size too big. I wear an 11 in both shoes and sneakers, but even accounting for the longish style they were way too big for me. The real problem came when I went to exchange them for a smaller size; in order to do that, I was directed to buy the same style at more than double the price! I had hoped to try this one pair and, if they were suitably comfortable and wore well, to start buying different styles. When I found the price hike on this style, I had identified another style of Stacy Adams shoes at a similarly low price, and was going to order that one in a size 10, having saved it in my cart. Yet when I got the refund notice for the return of this too large pair, I went to order the other style and found that the price on that other pair was also hiked, again to more than double what I was planning to pay. So much for that trial run.	2015-08-14

I love it I wish I would've ordered a half size lower than the one that I did.  It's a little bit bigger than I expected but by the tinyest amount.  My shoe size varies from 10-11 depending on the brand but mostly a 10 1/2 fits perfectly.  This 10 1/2 is slightly bigger but if I ordered a size 10 I could be saying it's to small.  No way to really tell, a bunch of local stores around me sell this shoe I should've tried it on there before I bought this but the price was super cheap on Amazon.  I wish they sold the sole separately it is so comfortable!  No other shoe sole compares so far that I've seen in my 29 years of living.

I was super excited to get them at a promotional rate in exchange for my fair and honest review.  They look just like the picture.  High quality material- sturdy stitching.  Even came in a cute box to make a cute gift.  However, they do not fit.  The size is 12-18 months which according to the sizing chart, is the equivalent of a size 5.  My daughter is 18 months, but has always worn smaller sized shoes.  She is in a 5 now.  Length wise, they would fit.  But her feet are chunky and the material has no give across the top of the shoe where the line is at the end of the frost piece.  I tried to squeeze them in there, but there was just no way width/girth wise.  I still love the shoes- I just really wish they would have accommodated her feet.  Most size 5s do.  They will make a nice gift for my friend anyways.	2015-08-14

The boots were amazingly comfortable, seemed well constructed and looked great. First couple days were tough as is with most boots but after the initial break in period they felt great. I typically work a 9 hour day and had no issues until about 6 months in.<br />The right boot sole started to come loose at the back a little. No big deal I just noticed it when I stepped, didn't affect performance. Few weeks later the laces wore out so I replaced them. Couple weeks after that I noticed I was getting wet feet - and I mean soaking wet. Even when it wasn't raining. I took a look at the sole and there was an approx 1 inch hole. I had to throw them away after about 8 months of use.<br /><br />I had expected when I bought these to get at least a years worth of good use out of the boots. I'm not particularly hard on them, I work maintenance at an apartment complex. Trying a more expensive boot this time and we'll see how it goes	2015-08-14

For the price, I expected them to be more durable. Almost immediately, portions of the boot itself scuffed off to reveal a whitish synthetic under the surface of the gray. Then, a couple weeks later, the rubber on the bottom of the heel on one of the boots came off and I had to push it back on. I didn't think these were boots that would last me a lifetime. But I did expect that they would last me a couple seasons. The Steve Madden boots I was replacing lasted me 3 New York City winters. No such luck with these.	2015-08-14

I am on my feet 12 hours a day constantly moving at work, and these shoes have done wonders for my legs and knees. Furthermore, they provide very good air flow which prevents excessive sweating and overheating. They are not as wide as I was expecting so my feet end up being cramped, but this doesn't cause any major discomfort. Overall I would say they are  a very good pair of shoes, and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for an affordable and comfortable shoe.	2015-08-14

Material is a little stiff, but I guess after more wear, it will soften.  If you normally wear a size 6, then 6 1/2 is definitely the right size, so don't get flustered if they don't carry size 6.  If you have a wide foot, then they might be too narrow, and for the first few times wearing it, it might not be too comfy until the material (especially by the stitches on the toe area) softens.  It's a nice gray color, between medium to dark gray.	2015-08-14

The materials seem top quality and they are very comfortable.  Although I haven't beaten them up yet, I'm confident these boots will perform as hoped.

She's the most beautiful and tiny woman I've ever known. Yet, is so accustomed to sexy high heels, she giggled like a schoolgirl when the Podiatrist removed the huge callouses from the balls of her feet and she walked for the first time without pain. The pain had come on so gradually, she didn't even realize it until its source was removed.  These sparkle, and help her ease the transition from sexy stilettos to functional, stabilizing, SAFE shoes for my sweet 85-pound, 90-year-old Mamma. I did have to teach her my tricky-quicky lacing technique for tightening up the heel/ankle so her narrow heels (like mine) do not slip, without tightening the instep or any other part of the shoe.  https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZNJE7y3tL._SS300_.jpg	2015-08-14

The 56CC is my first Puma shoe, I feel the foot bed is a bit thin. Hard walking surfaces \\\"come through\\\\\" the shoe. I can't/won't walk in these cool shoes for more than a few hours, maybe less if on asphalt/concrete. To me, Arch support is minimal but some may say none. Is this a Puma thing?  A friend mentioned his Puma's (different model shoe) also feel thin in the sole, but he still loves Puma brand.

More on the dressy side. The finish is sort of metallic which makes these a bit dressy. The cutout detail around the ankle is sort of, I can't find the words to describe it.  Don't take me wrong, its nice but just not a high level of finish I guess. But they are really nice and to buy them of clearance or a good sale, is totally worth it. So I'm happy with them.	2015-08-14

I ordered these in 11 standard when I usually wear new balance size 10.5 2E and these fit just like that size. I don't wear these for cardio since there really is no support but for lifting they are great. I found these because I was looking for a shoe that wasn't neon or fluorescent in color like new balance is going to. So far they are worth it in comfort.	2015-08-14

The cork sole is great it gives plenty of cushion without making the shoe heavy. I am actually very surprised at how comfortable these shoes are. The seam of the peep toe does rub on my big toe but that is the only down side. Oh and well maybe not using stairs with these. That is just me though. These are a great HIGH heel shoe but it doesn't look trashy the way some platform shoes can look. I love these with a maxi dress or skirt. The yellow is bright vivid sun yellow. Not an orange, neon, gold or lime yellow. It is a true yellow which is ecactly what I wanted.  This is a great fun shoe. Be prepared though, if you are not used to super high platforms you may be bumping your head. I am 5'8&#34; these easily make me 6 ft. So yeah some head bumps but still awesome shoes.	2015-08-14

I need a serious pair of boat shoes.  I change into and out of my boar shoes on the boat.  They never see any street use.  These are very comfortable, but the rubber is a bit harder (less gripping power) than I would like.  The gripping power is acceptable though.  The &#34;stickiness&#34; of these soles may be an accommodation to other factors - wear, hardening, etc.  I had a different model (no longer made) of Sperry shoes that had great soles - really soft, lots of grip - but they dried out (got hard) after a year or so.  These slightly harder soles may last longer and prove to be a better value.  Time will tell.	2015-08-14

The shaft is much brighter silver than shown, which makes them almost overwhelming with the glitter. The material is not &#34;faux leather&#34; it is plastic, thin, and cheap. The glitter has no sealant over it, I assume the glitter will rub off within a few wears and these will not look good for very long.

Light weight for distance running without being weighed down. Supportive and durable outsoles hold up against strong hard strides yet cushion every blow to fight off shin splints and save ur ankles. As if that isn't enough, the memory foam insole makes ur foot feel like it's been swallowed by a cloud. Many seem to feel there is less height in the heel portion of the shoe, whereas most running shoes have quite a difference in height ratio from the heel to the toe. However, to call these shoes flat runners is way off the mark. Yea there is slightly less height in the heel compared to other runners ive used, but the slight decrease in heel height actually seems to relieve the strain on the calf muscles. I recommend this shoe to everyone from beginners to crafted runners except for trail runners, just cuz there's not a great deal of support against lateral ankle movements that happen when u hit the dips and divots on a wooded trail. U'd  probably be better off with some cross trainers. Other than that, best shoe I've ever use for street running. Now stop wasting time reading the reviews, order the shoes and get ur lazy butt out there for a few miles!!! Game face!!!	2015-08-14

One was to be for me and one was to be a gift for my elderly aunt. In the end I decided to let my aunt choose which one she liked the best for her birthday. I am a pocket person, weather it is a pocketbook or weather it is with the clothes that I wear, so I wanted a pocketbook with a lot of pockets. And this one fits that perfectly! In fact, it had so many outside pockets that I did not discover all of them right away. I wanted multiple pockets so that I could organize and hold different things but at the same time allow me to put my hands right away on what I was searching for. These are some of the things I would carry around with me: My Kindle, my cell phone (basic), my clutch wallet, my wide tooth comb and a brush, paper and pen for when I needed to jot something down, something to hold change in, my lip gloss, cigarettes/lighter and my credit card holder/wallet type. At first I kept changing things around trying to figure out where I wanted to store things on the outside. Naturally the Kindle went into the back where the very wide pocket was, I finally put my basic cell phone in one of the pockets on the side, beneath where the straps are. There are 2 of those, one on each side. My credit card holder went into the pocket with the buckle on it, my cigarettes/lighter went into the Velcroed pocket next to the buckle pocket, and to my surprise, there was a small zipper pocket right behind the Velcro pocket, and even another pocket behind the zippered pocket. There was only one pocket inside the interior and I put my loose change there. The interior held everything else with room to spare. As much as this pocketbook held, it still was not too awkward and big to carry. It fit nicely on my shoulder and I had no trouble keeping it there. Oh, one thing I didn't discover for a few days, the large interior of the pocketbook has 2 zippers--that meet in the middle. I didn't realize this at first and was only using one zipper to zip it closed. I like the idea that if the pocketbook were to accidentally turn over then everything would be closed and could not spill out.  I have not had the pocketbook for long so I can't testify how long it will hold up--how long it will last. I hope it lasts a long time because I really like this pocketbook!he middle.

I received this item and noticed right out of the package that it seemed a little small. When I compared it to another Size 10 it measured ½” shorter. I thought this wouldn’t make much of a difference, but it does – when I try the flip-flop on it is a little too small for my Size 10 foot. I also noticed that nowhere on the sandal does it say what size it is. I would estimate it is an actual US Size 9.5, not 10.<br /><br />Usually I would suggest ordering a size bigger but then it might be too big! So a better suggestion would to be look at another product.  Why can’t Chinese manufacturers get their sizing together?!	2015-08-14

The color isn't pure silver nor gold, but somewhere in between (which I wasn't expecting, I thought they'd be more gray for some reason) -- I love the versatility, and how despite the fact that they're metallic, they're not &#34;in your face&#34; metallic like most other similar shoes.<br /><br />Sexy style, looks great. Comfortable IF you're used to high heels, otherwise will probably feel pretty terrible... I'm somewhere in between and the platform does help out (it's got moderate padding).<br /><br />Took the advice of the review suggesting to size up half a size and ended up with shoes half size too big.

I ordered this bag in two patterns; &#34;alpaca&#34; and &#34;cow.&#34;<br /><br />First, the good:<br />This bag is the perfect size for me. I love the canvas material, and I love all of the fun patterns that it is available in. It feels like it is of high quality and it will last me a good while. I also ordered matching wallets to go with each bag, and they are exactly what I had hoped they would be. I truly do love this bag, which brings me to...<br /><br />The bad:<br />The alpaca print bag arrived wrapped in cellophane, and when I opened it, the bag gave off this overwhelming musty smell, as if it had been sitting in someone's damp basement for the last three years. Despite this, I transferred the contents of my old purse into the alpaca print purse yesterday afternoon, spritzed the purse with vinegar, and went to an outdoor event for several hours, hoping that the bag would naturally air itself out. No luck. This morning I emptied the bag, sprayed it inside and out with Febreze, and it is currently hanging outside on a tree. I will update this review if I ever get the smell to go away.<br /><br />I had been looking forward to using the alpaca print bag the most because I have alpacas, and they look exactly like two of our guys. If I can't get rid of the smell, I won't use the purse. I feel embarrassed bringing it around people because it smells so strong. Fortunately, the cow print bag has only a faint smell to it that I think will go away fairly easily (and may have just originated from being shipped in the same box as the alpaca purse).<br /><br />I would have given this bag five stars, if not for that unfortunate odor. The bag itself suits my needs perfectly, and I love the way it looks and feels slung over my shoulder.<br /><br />EDIT (four days later): In addition to spraying the alpaca bag with vinegar and Febreze, I also tried washing it in the machine on gentle cycle with a pleasant-smelling detergent, and then hung the bag outside again for several more hours in the direct sunlight. I could STILL smell the horrible (mildew?) smell under all of the other scents on the bag. I have contacted the seller and will be returning this one.<br /><br />As far as the cow bag goes, I hung it up for a couple of hours inside my house with the windows open, and that was enough to eliminate any odor that had spread from the alpaca bag onto it. The cow bag smells just like any normal, new purse.re hours in the direct sunlight. I could STILL smell the horrible (mildew?) smell under all of the other scents on the bag.

I got this as a birthday gift for a friend who has expensive purses. I thought this would help her in keeping them clean and in great shape longer. The roduct came in due time but when I tested it out I couldn't close it back to clip on to my purse like I thought I would be able to. I contacted the seller to return it but they explained to me that they cannot do returns and that they would refund my money. I appreciated them getting back to me so soon. My friend really likes the hook and doesn't mind that she can't clip it to her purse. If clip worked I would have given it at least 4 stars.	2015-08-14

I just open my packaged that came later this (8/13/2015) evening. This bag looks AWFUL! It looks nothing like the picture. I knew it was a big bag based on the measurements. I thought it would have been more wide than tall, I guest I got the length and width mixed up. I hate it! Just what a previous customer said. The size of the bag is okay, you can put a lot of stuff in it especially tall things, but &#34;it came scratched up, and it's ugly!&#34; I didn't want to accept what she said so I told myself, &#34;She unfortunately got a bad one, mine will be fine&#34; WRONG! it's a very ugly, scratched up bag, and it looks worn on the outside and inside, and it has a crumbly like interior on the inside that appears as if it will wear very easily. Why would a company continue to sell a product in that condition? I agree with her, DON'T BUY THIS BAG! You're be wasting your time to wait for it to be delivered and then have to waste more time taking it back to the UPS store to return it. I HATE IT! I'm return it immediately!	2015-08-14

Mine wore out quickly and the strap the goes between your toes started wear and eventually broke off. 2. They don't supply that much arch support so i dont recommend walking in them for long periods of time. 3. Price... did i mention that already?

I'm going to give them a little longer to break them in. I think they'll fit better after a week or two. But I recommend going a 1/2 size larger than you normally would. I wear 10.5 (US) and think that an 11 would have fit better. Other than that the shoes are beautiful.	2015-08-14

I usually wear a size 8 1/2, or a 9 'medium width' if I get boots, but I ordered a size 8 and very glad I did. They do run a bit large just like the other reviewers said. For me, they are still easy to slip on and off with wool socks for a size 8 (and I have 'bigger' calf/ankles so that gives you an idea). Yet, they are aren't too big when walking around once they're on your feeties. In fact, they are so easy to slip on, that I'm wondering why it came with laces? I guess the laces are just for looks. But anyway, go with a size 8 if your about my size, and you won't regret it.  I think the only thing to note, is that the interior of the boot isn't fabric, but another type of rubber that just has that 'plaid' painted look to it. I ordered the black with the red 'plaid' interior, and thought it'd be fabric, but oh well, I guess I didn't read the entire description so that's my fault. I'm actually GLAD it's not fabric on the inside, though. Being rain boots and all, if the inside ever got damp, then well...it'd get pretty smelly and gross with fabric. So good on them for not putting a fabric material on the inside. But, make sure you are wearing socks when you slip these on!<br /><br />UPDATE 2016!<br />I still LOVE these so much. I don't have any rips or holes in my and almost wear them at least once a day (not a work though, lol). They are more of a 'rain' boot, but personally, I've been wearing them in the snow, too. They work just fine! Put on some cozy socks, and you'll love these. I wore these to my trip to England and soooo glad I had these (rain, rain, RAIN! Mud, and more mud, then more rain) and I also wore them on my flight to and from the States. Easy to slip off and put under the airplane seats (don't worry, I put on slippers so my feet don't stink up the place lol) and just a very versatile, useful boot :) Oh and yes, I get compliments on these babies.	2015-08-14

I have had this purse for only a few days, but it is exactly as described. I am a big bag, lots of pockets girl. This purse fits the ticket. I would like a center zip compartment inside, but that would be the only other pocket I would want. There are two roomy snap pockets on the front for things like a phone and lipstick and more. One of these pockets has a zippered pocket, too. There are two open pockets on either end I am using for gum and reading glasses. On the back of the bag, there is a roomy zippered pocket. The inside features two open slip pockets and a back wall zippered pocket. It comes with a shoulder strap also. Plenty of room made of strong canvas and has feet on the bottom. All in all I am very happy with my purchase. The price was fabulous, too!! I just wish it was made in the USA.	2015-08-14

I bought these for general wear and for working on a hilly golf course. They are fantastic turf shoes and I love them.

They also seem to be well made, they don't look or feel as if they will wear out or fall apart. But the problem with these shoes is that the are very wide. I have never owned a pair of shoes as wide as these. If your feet are even slightly narrow these will be too wide for you.

This wasn't printed on the ticket and I wasn't the only one to lose my purse that day.  I was able to keep my contents, but not my purse :(<br />This purse can carry everything I need. It's roomy enough to put my iPad in it.  I use the large outer zippered section to keep my coupons. (The large Bed Bath and Beyond coupons fit without folding). The 3 small inner pockets are great to put business cards, dollars, loyalty cards, lists and notes in.  The inner small zippered pocket is nice to put money of all kinds in.<br />While many may not like the large size of this bag, I love this bag!	2015-08-14

My neice was super happy when she saw her new rain boots! She is 7 and loved the color and she said they were actually very comfortable and soft inside. I personally loved the handles on the side that made putting them on very simple for her. I also liked that they didn't loose color after getting wet, and the bottoms of them are rough and provide traction for areas that you may otherwise slip on. I personally feel the SIYA rain boots are durable and renforced enough around the soles, that they keep the little one feet warm and dry. The inside is lined with a neutral fabric, and they are very easy to clean. They fit my neice true to size, and don't slide up and down on her ankle. The design is super cute and colorful, yet it is neutral enough to go with about anything she wears. I also love that you can dress and outfit up, or down with the SIYA rain boots. I can't say enough good things about the SIYA rain boots, they are cute, comfortable, durable, and easy to pull on! I received this item at a discount price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The price however does not affect my opinion of the product.	2015-08-14

My son wears orthotics on his feet, so sandals in the summer help keep his feet cool.  These sandals fit well with or without his orthotics, so even though they aren't sized for wide feet, they work very well with the wide sizing when we need it and slim down when we don't.  He's rough in shoes and they have held up pretty well considering all that he has put them through so far!	2015-08-14

She's never owned a pair of FRYE's (I've never even heard of them) and so she was VERY ecstatic that I got them for her as a surprise.<br /><br />She's had foot surgery and pretty much had to stop wearing high heels and has finally worked her way up to 3 inches and so since she just had a garage sale and sold a lot of shoes that (even brand new ones) she can't wear and so luckily I had already ordered these and had it gift-wrapped and told her she got a Christmas present early.<br /><br />Well, let's just say that she almost was brought to tears when she saw that they were ACTUALLY boots inside the shoebox instead of something else (I've been known to play pranks and put something different inside of an expensive box).  And she kept asking me,  &#34;How did you know?!?&#34; because she completely forgot she put those on my wishlist some time ago.  Needless to say, even though it's summer she's ready to wear these NOW!!<br /><br />So fellas, if you want to get a Birthday/Anniversary/Christmas present, this would be a 'step' in the right direction! Ha!<br /><br />Now, on another note, the only CON to the whole thing.<br /><br />The shipping box it came in (standard Amazon brown-box) had an issue:  the top of the box was OPENED, as if someone had opened it up to see what was inside, found out it was gift-wrapped, and then put it back in and LAZILY put a clear piece of tape over the top that a 1yr old could've ripped off with out any effort.<br /><br />Now, I live in a decent neighborhood on a dead-end street, and the box was left on the front porch like so many others have been, and to see what's on my porch, you have to LOOK on purpose to see what's up there or otherwise even walking you'd pass my porch rather quickly being it's recessed from the street and my house sits on a small hill elevated from the street.<br /><br />So, unfortunately I'll never know why it was like that but fortunately it wasn't stolen or damaged because me and Amazon would've have some words to discuss.<br /><br />I was tempted to take a picture and send it in, but being this is the first time that this has happened and that everything was in order, I was in a forgiving mood.  If it happens again best believe I'll let the world know.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions, comments or otherwise I'll be more than happy to answer them to the best of my ability.	2015-08-14

The problem is the back of the shoe where it goes across your Achilles tendon... do you see that upper edge?  Well, he's the culprit.  The edge is done in such a way that it cuts into your Achilles, most heinously.  I had to buy heel pads to thicken the back of the shoe, just below the edge, so it would push my foot forward and away from the Achilles wrecker.  The thing is, once you've got to go to such measures to make a shoe the least bit tolerable, it changes the way the rest of the shoe fits, which is less than ideal.  It's not comfortable enough to go for walks, so it ended up becoming my gardening shoe... and let me be clear here, I don't garden much.	2015-08-14

I have been wearing Keens for years, but always the fabric strap/rubber sole kind. When I saw that Keens now come in this leather design, I was psyched. I actually had on my previous Keens while I was making the online order, so I checked the size and ordered that size (9). For context: I wear a 9 in almost all footwear, besides a few athletic shoes (Puma and Nike), in which I wear a 9.5. When these Keens arrived, I loved their look, but my heel hung off the back considerably, and I couldn't make them work at all. I also felt like even with wiggling my toes and tightening the straps of the shoe, I couldn't get my toes to a place where they stayed toward the front of the shoe as I walked (and therefore contributing to my heel hanging so far off the back). I was confused, but figured this style just ran small, and exchanged them for the 9.5. When the 9.5 arrived, my heel hung off the back of the shoe maybe slightly less, but still too much that it affected the comfort and aesthetic of my foot in the shoe (with every step I took, I could not only see but also feel that something was off and my heel was too far back). I put in an exchange for the 10 (even though I have never worn a size 10 in any shoe, ever), but I think the problem might be the shoe. Unlike the previous Keens that I have owned (the Whisper Sandal in fabric), the heel bed of this shoe is totally flat, rather than with a slight curve upwards at the back of the heel. That slight curve in the Keens I currently wear seems to function to keep my toes toward the front of the shoe and, overall, keep my foot in the right place. I think the problem with these Keens is that the heel bed is completely flat, with no curve at the back, so there is nothing to keep my toes toward the front of the shoe. I think the problem with the 10s will be that there is way too much space between my toes and the front of the shoe, but I'm still willing to give them a try -- I really like the way Keens look in leather!	2015-08-14

A good alternative to my other indoor winter slip-on shoes, the Halflinger clogs I had for over ten years. Halflingers are still great. But for people who aren't considerably well-to-do, this is an excellent alternative. It is high enough for people with high insteps, and wide enough for people who need or like wide shoes. Too many shoes lack this. Especially the high enough instep. You &#34;Others&#34;: We've had it with trying to squeeze our instep into your flat-footed shoes!  Give it some -- even teensy -- bit of arch support, so my arch actually feels shoe underneath it instead of air, and I'll give it 5 stars.  Even though it is noticeably less &#34;cushy&#34; than my regular Croc from 2009. I don't know if the quality went down with cutting corners, or what.

The boots felt like there were no cushions inside. My feet were on fire for two days. It's too bad I had an unpleasant experience. I wanted to try another work boot besides Wolverines but it looks like I'm going to stick with them. So far, the Wolverine work boot is the most  comfortable work boot there is.	2015-08-14

I started wearing Teva's about 35 years ago when the sandals looked all the same, men and women's.  I found the Tirra model about 8 years ago at REI.  At that time it was new and only came in black.  I live in California so I can often wear my sandals every day, all day....sometimes with socks.  I now own four pair and am trying to decide on the next color to order! I still wear my first pair as it shows very little wear!  Can't find that often in a shoe after 8 years!<br />I broke my left foot, ankle and leg about 2 1/2 years ago and can walk all day in these sandals.  I only wear 3 brands of shoes Teva (Tirra), Keens and SAS shoes.  I dress for style and comfort and these shoes accommodate me completely!  I own more Teva sandals than any other brand.  I recently went to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk and was on my feet from 10:30 am til 11:30pm,  I only sat down when eating or riding rides.  Thank you  Teva for making a grand sandal that is stylish, pretty and ever so comfortable and colorful!!	2015-08-14

The leather is very soft, it's very easy to put on by a 2 year old, and very light.  I bought one in 8, and they were a little too big for my son (he is a 7.5 Wide).  So I kept the 8 and bought the 7.  The 7 fits very well on him.  Just FYI - my son has chunky feet with high arch so it's a bit hard to find shoes that fit him perfectly.  We have been lucky with this particular See Kai Run.  My only complaint is that the shoes do not protect his big toe.  The opening on the front is big enough for his big toes to poke out.  I have noticed that his big toenails get chipped quite a bit.  I am guessing it is due to the fact that these shoes do not offer protection on the toes (unlike other brands like Keen).  I've been trying to think of ways to &#34;cover&#34; that hole, from ductaping it (which will probably make it look really ghetto), or to sewing a strip of leather to the shoes.  If any of the readers have any ideas, I'm open!  However, he has no complaints.  If I ask him to pick which shoes he wants to wear, he would pick these over and over again.  And these are perfect for summer, very airy and light.	2015-08-14

The heel is high, so I don't recommend if you aren't used to wearing heels or need arch support.  I don't mind a man-made sole on platform shoes, but I wish the lining was real leather since it's much more comfortable.  Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with these.  They were a great buy and I received compliments the first time I wore them.  The color is very versatile, and I'm sure I'll be wearing them regularly.  I'm even thinking of ordering them in another color.	2015-08-14

These boots are a favorite, I wear them at least 2 times a week and love the way they look.

They do run a bit narrow so if you have a wide foot I would not recommend them. I gave them 4 stars because they are a bit difficult to get on. I have the Minnetonka back zip single fringe boots which I prefer because they are much easier to get on as apposed to these double fringe side zips.

I'm looking forward to having the correct size, as these really appear to be good work shoes. Two weeks later... Further to the above, I normally use a size 13 shoe. I returned the size 13 Nautilus items and exchanged them for the next full size down, a size 12. I've used them virtually every day since then and provided I use good work socks, these boots are brilliant. They are extremely easy to get on, feel solid and robust, and above all, are very comfortable. Update January '17. Don't expect these shoes to ever wear out. That should be good news, but it isn't. These shoes will fall apart and disintegrate a long time before they have a chance to wear out. If you need them for twelve months or less, they may be good.   I'm very disappointed to honest.	2015-08-14

I over-pronate and need the most stability and correction I can get, so I decided to try the Mizuno brand for the very first time. The Paradox are touted as the most stable within the Mizuno line and one step higher than the Wave Inspire I bought at the same time.<br />In a nutshell:<br />Stability: The stability is above average and I think will do quite well to correct my pronation. Even though it has been about a year since I wore my previous brand of stability enhancing shoes, my feet are not sore and I have been happy with how they are fitting and holding up so far.<br />Fit/Weight: Paradox are much lighter than my previous Asics, which is what I was looking for. Over-pronation correcting shoes are often heavy so these are nice on that front. The fit is neither too small or too roomy...they fit exactly to size. I would increase a 1/2-1 whole size larger if I needed to put my orthotics into them, though.<br />Comfort: I think support is the most important, but they are comfortable, as well. I'm surprised my feet are not hurting terribly while breaking them in, but so far, so good. I haven't taken a run in them yet though, so I may add on to this review once I accomplish that one.<br />Look: The disappointing thing with these shoes is probably the lack of colors to choose from, but they are quality shoes and this particular pair were incredibly affordable. I purchased the Wave Inspire at the same time so I could try them both out, and the colors were MUCH better, but the cost of the Wave Inspires was almost three times more than this sale price. All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase!	2015-08-14

You can STUFF it to the gills. Even the most disorganized person can find her stuff easily! I like it because it functions like a mini office. The fact that the main inside compartment is light grey and not too deep makes finding what you need a snap. I have beautiful expensive Dooney's, but they are too heavy and clunky for everyday use. This bag is so light and comfortable to carry. I'm disabled and my husband does not mind holding it for me sometimes since it looks like a camera bag. The stap does not dig into your shoulder no matter how heavy the bag is, & my bag is stuffed! You can not believe how much this bag holds. I would imagine it will last for years! Excellent quality, zippers never fail, you can move the strap length easily, and it is water resistant. I'm in my mid-50's and while I sometimes wish the bag was more fashionable, for what I have to carry, this bag is just unbeatable. It's &#34;OLD RELIABLE&#34; for sure! Like the old Timex ads: takes a licking and keeps on ticking! Quality product.Based on this bag, I would order anything from this mfg.I can't think of any way to improve it but to say I wish it were just a bit more stylish!	2015-08-14

They came in today, I was so excited. I opened the box and thought they looked large. So I looked at the size of the shoe which said 8. The box said 6.5 but someone had scribbled that out and handwritten Size 8. The return seemed easy and quick but there was no option for me to request the correct size. Now I'll have to wait for my refund to go through and then try again.  EDIT: the new shoes arrived and they are great. They were the correct size, fit my size 6.5 perfectly. The return process was completely painless. I wasn't offered an exchange option so I returned the wrong shoes, waited till they were received, and reordered them. All in all I am very glad I ended up with the shoes I wanted, at a great price with only a minor glitch that was easily taken care of.	2015-08-14

I was told the sizing was spot on but they were a little narrower than usual; he has owned several pair of Adidas shoes in the same size so I think the width issue is due to these being fabric as opposed to the usual leather all over. Not so narrow he hasn't worn them or wanted to return them though. They may have just needed more break in time due to the fabrication but that's just a guess.	2015-08-14

When I buy shoes, I expect them to be cool, to be durable, and to look good for at least a year, especially if they are made by a big brand like PUMA.

I have been wearing them for only 5 months and they are already falling apart.  Granted I walk a lot, but skate shoes are supposed to be built to stand up to hard and heavy use (you know, like skateboarding...) and these absolutely do not.  The upper has separated from the sole in several places, the plastic lining is broken and poking through, there is a hole worn through the sole, and the heelcups are completely worn away with broken bare plastic showing. Remember, all this is after less than 6 months.<br /><br />For what I paid ($13) I couldn't care less because for $13 I'll happily just buy a new pair every 5 months, but if you are paying more than that I do not think these shoes are a good deal.	2015-08-14

They draw attention so if you are needing  a pedicure don't wear these until you get one as people will be looking at your feet. Lol.

Can push it right to the front of the shoe before inserting the back so it fills up right from the toe area and removes all the creases. Once the back is inserted it widens the front part so it fills up the width. It can therefore fit into either wide or narrow shoes easily and does exactly what it's supposed to do. I will definitely be ordering many more. I wear a 7 and the small is spot on.	2015-08-14

These wedges are super cute but as others mention, not the most comfortable.  The over the toe strap is a bit shallow and tight so they are not for walking distances.  I have very small and narrow feet so figured other reviewers may have different foot shape than I, but they are definitely right across the top of my foot.  I have worn them a few times hoping they would stretch a bit - and they have, a little - but they are still pretty uncomfortable.  I still wear them when my outfit begs for this look but I usually regret it by the time I get home and take them off.	2015-08-14

But the right shoe was defective because the toe grip peeled almost completely off in the first 30 seconds of use.  Also, they felt very uncomfortable to use, at first, and made me feel awkward and off balance.  I couldn't identify the cause until I eventually removed the inserts.  The left shoe proved defective because beneath the padded insert were TWO thinner inserts.  The right shoe contained only one insert.  This caused me to be off balance.  Overall I'd say Apex has poor quality control despite a pretty good shoe design.  I purchased these six months ago so it's possible their QC people improved their methods.	2015-08-14

I have purchase sunglasses to numerous to count in all styles and shapes ranging from 1.00 to 800.00 dollars.  In all these years though I have never thought of purchasing a pair online, do to the fact that I so enjoy trying them on first, to see about there fit,style,shaping, and construction, but moreover to see how they make me feel when i put them on and look in the mirror.<br />When I saw these though I decided to take the plunge and i'm glad I did. These Sunglasses arrived very fast and were packaged exceptionally well in a beautiful Burberry box and hard eyeglass case. The semi cats eye shape lenses along with the Burberry designed logo side arms are incredibly beautiful and  are made of high quality material,normally found on much higher priced designer glasses.  As for style and fit and the way that I feel upon wearing them I can only say that these are now my absolute favorite out of the hundreds that I have.	2015-08-14

I purchased a pair with clear lens as i like to ride at 5 AM when it is still dark and cool here in Florida.  I was cheaper to purchase these than clear Oakley lenses.  So buy them and you will not be disappointed.  The reason for 4 stars is that i asked a question about he dual lenses and many said their glasses came with extra lenses.  Mine didn't.

I give this product a two star solely because the cushion inside the pulltab/collar is made so purely that everytime I slip my foot inside the cushion moves down which creates a bump. After the second or third wear I was always uncomfortable walking around as I always felt like there is something nudging the top of my heel. I love Sketchers but I am very very disappointed with this product.<br /><br />I only bought Go Bionic 2 because I have been wearing Go Bionic 1 for over 2 years non stop and loved how amazingly comfortable they felt on a daily use for work and exercise. They really got it wrong with this model and its heavily flawed. Please let Go Bionic 3 be flawless like the first one. I will wait for Go Bionic 3 and buy that for sure as Sketchers has only failed me once after purchased so many models.<br /><br />Note: If you look closely in the photos you will see how the pulltab/collar cushion inside the shoe has been pushed forward which made stop wearing them for good	2015-08-14

It was the size I was looking for and was inexpensive. I suppose buying a higher priced shoe horn would have come better finished.  I took 400 grit along all the edges and took off the edges.  The steel was marked up from the forming so I polished it and the edges on my buffer.  Now it is a respectable shoe horn but without the final finishing I agree the sharp edges would have made it unusable.	2015-08-14

They look good with all of it plus they came with 2 pairs of strings to lace. One is more casual and the other makes them look more like boat shoes. I typically use the more casual ones which make them look a little better with most of my shorts but I think they dress up jeans a lot or you can even wear them with khackis. I love the color as they blend in with anything. They do run a little big, so order a half a size small	2015-08-14

I live in Southern California, and had not have the chance to wear them just yet. I am planning to live in Indiana later this year, so i thought i'd be pro-active and buy a pair that's on sale - and good quality.<br />the Good:<br />the leather and the other materials used seem top notch.<br />it has toe protection, but it's not steel. But, it's hard - I think they say it's for electricians use.<br />the Bad:<br />It's heavy, bottom heavy. I feel as if this wasn't boots, it would fall off of my feet.<br />It's a bit bigger than expected using my my sneaker size.<br /><br />I can't have a good verdict because I really  haven't used them.<br />From what i have tried, it gets warm really fast. I guess it's really for cold season, i just wanted to get a work boot.<br />I do not regret this purchase. I feel like i'm going to get a whole lot of use out of them.<br />Solid purchase for the sale price of less than $100.	2015-08-14

I wasn't too sure how these would turn out seeing the other reviews, but I gotta say that I love these boots! Great quality for the price--durable, comfortable (though I would suggest getting some extra-padded soles), and they look great! I will admit, they are a little large, but only by a little bit (about .5 a size too big [usually a size 10, feels like 10.5-11]), but that's fine if you're like me and prefer a little wiggle room for the toes. It takes about 2-3 days to finally get them worn in, as during that time they were a little tight.

The stickers are full of uniform holes which make it possible to see pretty clearly and they will do a good job of blocking the sun. I am overall really happy with my purchase.	2015-08-14

These are super comfortable, right out of the box. I was a little leary, due to the lack of reviews, but took a chance based on the low price.<br /><br />Word of caution. I have wide feet. I normally wear a 9 1/2 4E, sometimes even a 10 4E. I ordered these in a size 9 M, based on a review that said that a size 9 fit large and a little wide. These are absolutely perfect for my feet. If anything they tend a little big, and fit about the same as my  ASICS 10 4E. Long story short, I'd order these a size smaller than you usually wear if I were you. If you have very narrow feet you might do better to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Having said that, these are still ridiculously comfy. I would absolutely order again.<br /><br />Two possible detractors:<br /><br />The outsole is a little slick. Not a problem outside, on trails or sidewalks. They tend to slide a little on smooth floors, like tile or hardwood. This seems to be getting better the more I wear them. Maybe I'm roughing up the soles a little.<br /><br />Not very arch supportive. I've seen way worse, and they do seem to be fitting themselves to my feet the more I wear them, so maybe they'll get more supportive the longer I own them,<br /><br />Did I mention that they are ridiculously comfortable? I would have given them five stars, but honestly the advertised fit is a little off.	2015-08-14

I bought a pair of &#34;big kids&#34; size 6.5 for my daughter, and they are big enough to fit me and I'm a women's size 11. They are labeled as a 6.5 and also a european size is 42.5, which is an 11.5 in women's shoes. I have no idea why the sizing is SO bizarre, but I'm irritated as I bought these for her for back-to-school and now we're going to have to find an alternative.	2015-08-14

These shoes came reccomended to me by ...	I went through 2 pairs of these shoes and both failed for different reasons.<br /><br />I weight in at 315 pounds, am on my feet 11+ hours a day at work, I walk between 8 and 11 miles a shift in a warehouse and I have terrible arches.  These shoes came reccomended to me by co-worker who has since stopped wearing them as well.<br /><br />Pair 1 literally fell apart at the seams within the first few days of me wearing them.  They fit fine but the stitching was so close to the edge of the material that it began to seperate.  Also, the body of the shoe began coming apart from the soles.  best part was that Amazon is a great place to purchase from.  The new shoes were here in a couple of days.  GREAT JOB Amazon ... I really can count on you!<br /><br />Pair 2 lasted longer, but gradually and I am speaking weeks 3 going forward, I noticed the cushoning going away and my foot, leg and knee pain returning.  By week 8 I had completely flattened the memory foam insoles to the point that they only remembered to lie there as flat as a sheet of paper offering absolutely NO support whatsoever.<br /><br />I tried to insert my go-to insoles from Spenco [[ASIN:B000G1IL7C Spenco Polysorb Heavy Duty, Men's 12-13]] and because the insole is not removable in these shoes, the inserts began curling and creating a new level of foot pain for me.<br /><br />I just ordered a new pair of my favorite work shoes [[ASIN:B007JTX95I New Balance Men's MX623 Cross-Training Shoe,Black,13 4E US]] that seem to do well, so much so I put the insoles into a pair I wore for almost a year every day and they kept me virtually pain free all shift yesterday.  Too bad I wore out the soles before the rest of the shoe or I would not have had to order a new pair a few minutes ago.<br /><br />If you plan to wear the Skechers Vigor 2.0 memory Foam shoes as a casual pair and not have to depend on them or you are one of those who love throwing away money (you can throw it at me anytime, I like to hold on to it as best I can), then these are ok shoes.  If you are on your feet and think these shoes will help you make it through another shift, spend your money elsewhere.I can), then these are ok shoes.  If you are on your feet and think these shoes will help you make it through another shift, spend your money elsewhere.	2015-08-14

My girls are just now starting to wear a size 3 shoe which gives them plenty of room to grow. I purchased size 3/4 thinking they would probably be a bit big for them, but they just fit them. They will prob out grow them in a few months. I like the product itself, my girls love them but the sizes just seem to be off. The first time I bought two different colors (same style, same size, just different color) and they were not even close to same size.	2015-08-14

They have held up well and are comfortable.  Although I can't say it is because of the shoes, but I had plantar plantar fasciitis when I got these, and since then it has gone away.

High quality leather, exactly as described, but better, fits all my cards, cash, ID, business cards, etc. and fits inside my  cell phone wallet quite well.  Was a little skeptical about only 3 card slots, but found that those cards I use must often are always easily available, and all others fit into the zipper pocket nicely.  This does EXACTLY what I needed it to do.  Protect my cards from theft, but let me organize all so that I can forego a larger purse, if desired.  Great for just running to the store, because my cell phone wallet ALWAYS goes, so that's all I have to grab now.  Thanks.	2015-08-14

These shoes are well-cushioned and adequately comfortable for jogging for the half-hour or so that I run at a time, but oddly enough I can't wear them for just walking around. The lack of arch support causes my feet to ache after an hour or two. I like them just fine, but I'm not terribly enthusiastic about them. Given how expensive they are, I doubt I will buy another pair when these wear out.	2015-08-14

I usually wear a 9.5 in most shoes and a 10 in Chinese Laundry strappy shoes but this shoe feels very loose and kind of sloppy.

Loved my old pair of Chaco flips except that they were a bit heavy and the tread pattern was not aggressive enough, which led to me losing traction on several occasions.

Was surprised to find that the top strap and thong part is actually soft leather, not plastic.  They are very comfortable.  Sometimes the thong part of this type of shoe scratches and you can't wear it long.  These are soft and I can and have worn them all day shopping and totally comfortable throughout the day.

I would have given it a 5 and it is leaning closer in that direction as the thong part was a little stiff at first. It is softening. Size 7 works great for me. I usually wear a 6, sometimes a 6 and 1/2. But the size 7 is a good fit in this sandal. I would recommend them, and good for the price.	2015-08-14

I liked them enough to post part of that review here: ...The glasses we received were black and silver in color, and the lenses had a grey tint. These imported glasses are made of a very lightweight, shatterproof, flexible, durable stainless steel metal frame (57 mm). The composite Tr90 nylon lenses are non-polarized, but are created to block 100% UV (UVA, UVB, UVC and up to 400nm of blue light) – which will give users the best visual clarity possible for sunny days, winter or water glare, and glare off buildings, roads and vehicles.<br />Very lightweight glasses might seem cheap, but when you really look at the design you’ll notice metal hinges that don’t have screws to catch hair or scratch skin or come loose over time. The ends of the arms (that go over the top of the ears) and the nose bridge are both encased in white rubber pads to improve comfort. You’ll hardly notice these things are on top your head and may end up running around looking for them, wondering where you left them!  Ha ha<br />These are designed for men – and the first thing my husband noticed was that the lenses were out from the face a little and he thought that would definitely prevent them from fogging up or getting sweat on them which often happens to his other pairs when he’s cycling, hiking or snowshoeing. Because these are so lightweight it is unlikely that they would slip off the nose or slide around on the ears when the head begins to sweat.	2015-08-14

This bag is large enough to carry my wallet, phone, headphones, writing utensils, and so much else. To my delight, the bag is basically a beautiful tote that can hold my life without requiring me to bulk up my muscles. it was still not too heavy to carry around. The material is light and the sides are sturdy so even without a divider in the center, the contents can be easily organized.	2015-08-14

These vintage series Docs are exactly what I was looking for.  I have wide, high volume feet, so I will be in for a rather lengthy break in period - keep that in mind if you're buying the vintage rather than the Asian made boots. The leather is thicker, stiffer, and there is less room in the toe area due to the cap lining. The only minor quibble I have is that the eyelets are no longer stamped with &#34;Dr. Martens&#34; on each one like my old pair.<br /><br />I read several reviews on the Asian made boots and many stated a quick or no break in period.  That raised red flags for me as proper Docs take some time in my experience to mold to one's feet.  Leads me to believe that the leather is of a lesser quality and that they would not have the durability I expect in a pair of boots at this price.  I have an old pair that I bought in the mid 90's that look a lot worse for wear as I wore them virtually every day for a decade, but structurally they are still rock solid. Spend the extra money on the vintage series and don't look back - you won't regret it!	2015-08-14

I got the purple in a 9, they're true to color. I thought they seemed a bit big in length when I first tried them on but my toes are short and my feet slide a bit forward when I walk so it's good there is extra room. They're comfortable and seem pretty sturdy so I can see them lasting for quite a while. They're a pain in the butt to buckle and unbuckle but I was able to adjust the buckle to fit my feet and then just slide them on and off.  Edit: Ran into the same problem as many other reviewers, straps on the side have popped on both shoes after very few wears.	2015-08-14

Mine is tan with gold color, and is absolutely beautiful. I love the crocodile look without an actual crocodile losing its life for the sake of a wallet.<br /><br />I got this for a different reason that most people would. When my phone contract is up, I'm going to get an LG G4, and I was trying to find something stylish in which I could carry the phone, plus a stylus. After I bought it, I went to an AT&T store where they were nice enough to let me see if the phone would fit. It did, with a little bit of room to spare. The woman who helped me fell in love with the wallet and said she was going to go get one for herself!<br /><br />So, I now have a very stylish, beautiful and well-made phone case that I hope will last me a long time.	2015-08-14

The small at the store fit, but I'm a size 8 and knew a medium would be more comfortable. However, it's slightly tight and not very much room for my toes to move around. In short, I think the sizing is inconsistent. You may get lucky, maybe not. I sent a pair to my mom, who's also an 8, and hers are perfect. Mine went to my niece instead.

I had an event the day I received it and rushed to change to this bag which was a costly and most regrettable mistake.  This bag lost completely all of its structure within just a few hours.  I did NOT load it with too many items.  I only had my wallet, keys, cell phone, and lip gloss.  After using  the bag it completely collapses and looks as if you ran over it with a dump truck.  I expected better quality from a bag in this price range and from this designer  I splurge once a year on a birthday gift and this purchase makes me want to cry.  I totally wasted nearly $400.  I would have been just as happy with a $50 bag.  I wish I'd purchased it from a seller who would take returns on quality because I have all of the packaging and it looks brand new.  I knew this bag would be a little slouchy based on he suede but this bag falls flat as a pancake.  This is NOT worth the money at all.  I write this to try and prevent other from making my mistake. Save your money!!!  Regrettably I won't purchase another bag from Amazon.	2015-08-14

The inside of the heel of one of the shoes has worn through and today I got a large blister about three miles from home and had a totally bloody sock by the time I got home.  I've been wearing Gel Kayanos since about version 11` or 13 and they always fit the same, very comfortable but with good support.  So I guess they decided to change a good thing  and stuff them with padding so only the most narrow foot will fit comfortably.  I suppose there is a wider version but good luck trying to find anything but a regular fit at a local store and I'm not risk $150 over the internet hoping they'll fit.  Final gripe: the laces are about 4-6 inches too short now for back lacing.  It is hard getting them on and off without totally undoing the back lacing.  Big disappointment.  Follow up: The heel padding broke out of the right shoe.  If I don't wear a  band aid for my 5-6 mile run I come home with the back half of my non cotton sock soaked in blood.	2015-08-14

It does run very small so I would suggest ordering two sizes up. With other brands my son is a size 7.5 or 8. Thank goodness for the free returns. At first I ordered size 8 (in red) and while it would fit my son, it didn't leave much room for growth. The insoles have a guide for the child's foot showing the correct sizing, this is a very helpful feature.  With the size 8 his toes were EXACTLY where the drawn &#34;toes&#34; on the insoles were which would mean they are a perfect fit. But since I want a longer use out of them I ordered the size 9 in green (because the price was better than the red in size 9).  With the size 9 his toes land EXACTLY at the insoles line that says &#34;too big&#34; but I felt it was still fine. He has worn the size 9 for a few days now and he hasn't tripped or had any issues. His foot is very secure and he hasn't complained of any discomfort.  I hope they are durable and hold up until he grows out of them. My son's feet aren't wide but it seems to me that a wide foot would be an issue since they seem narrow.	2015-08-14

Love the wallet.  The style and size was definitely suitable for what I had been searching for.  There's so many card slots inside this wallet and I like the extra flap in the middle for any extra cards I have, like my membership cards and others.  There's also a pocket inside the wallet deep enough to fit my passport.<br />Well, I just did a review on one of the Yahoho Womens Leather Bags I purchased with this wallet and I have one basic concern, the zippers.<br />The zipper quality or the way it is sewn into place is absolutely terrible. The smallest amount of change placed inside the change compartment makes the zipper stick mid-way while zipping it open or close.  The best was to zip the change compartment closed or open is to unsnap the wallet first then zip the change compartment.  (My life is too involved and too busy to have to follow steps zipping a wallet).<br />This just makes me feel as though the company did not test the product for it purpose .... by not placing items inside the change compartment to make sure the zipper would work properly.	2015-08-14

I received these boots 9 days ago and they are already falling apart.<br /><br />Written on the inside of the tongue is the word &#34;blemish&#34; on both boots. The seller is clearly selling a knowingly defective product without stating so in the product listing. That's shady at best, and it should not be legal...<br /><br />The sole is separating from the boot, badly on one of them. It started a few days into wearing them and is rapidly getting worse. I could probably grab it it pull it clean off easily. I will be returning these asap. It's a shame too because everything else about these boots are absoluelty perfect. I have two pair of Air Force issued boots (one regular, one cold-weather) that I have been using for years. They are great boots but starting to show their age. The Marine RAT boots are better in every possible way. They are confortable, look great and I would enjoy these for years to come if they didn't start falling apart in less than a week.<br /><br />Take caution when buying these! I would not recommend buying RAT boots online unless they are made by Danner, and certainly not from Plus More Inc.	2015-08-14

I usually buy the Teva all black mush II flip flops but this time I wanted a little more style.  These are quality flip flops but they do not feel as soft as the usually mush II's which was disappointing.  But, if you are not used to the super softness of the normal Mush II you may not notice.  That's my only issue and I think Teva still makes quality flip flops.	2015-08-14

This is always a problem when i buy jeans or combat boots. So its not the shoe or anything. But i ordered these boots two day ago ( august 12) and they came like two weeks early. Today is  august 14! Tall about super duper fast delivery! I am very pleased. The shoe js somewhat darker than the picture, like its more of a coffee brown. but i like it tho. I didnt really like how light it looked in the picture. So definitely a good buy. This was my first time buting shoes from amazon, and i was very skeptical.

I had bought designer sunglasses by Ralph Lauren a few years ago. They are as well made as my Ralph Laurens for whole lot less. The frames are sturdy. Now as far the fit goes, it fits my face perfectly.  If you are familiar with Oakley's Branding called Asian Fit - These sunglasses would definitely fall under the same category. They fit across my shallow bridge of my nose and they don't ride my high cheek bones. The color is soft shell pink which goes well with my tan complexion. I like them so much that I came back for the Navy Version. For the price of $25, which is about what I paid, I recommend this style for those have a wider face. If your face shape is long and narrow, it might not work.	2015-08-14

They are very stimulating to the feet so I would take caution to not over wear them at firs. Your feet will feel great the moment you take them off like you just had a foot massage. I wear these everywhere. Very versatile, The adjustable velcro makes it easily adapt to different widths. Length is true to size. The colors rock. One bonus feature -- non-slip grip unlike standard &#34;flip flops&#34; -- ie... walk into a slippery bathroom in flip flops, you best be wearing a helmet (in my household) -- surprisingly, these are an amazingly safe sole for slippery floors even when mopping or if showering in a slippery tub it would be great for anyone with challenges in balancing or fear of falling.	2015-08-14

I purchased these Crocs based on the reviews I read here on Amazon as well as another website that stated these were one of the top shoes on their list. The look of them is certainly not a selling point but I was willing to forgo fashion if they were comfortable. I was purchasing these in hopes that they would provide comfort at work where I stand for 8+ hours a day. They claim to be a great shoe for those on their feet all day. Now there is a definite difference between being on your feet walking all day verses standing in the same spot. I did not feel that they were any more comfortable then a normal pair of tennis shoes. The fit through the toe box is loose, almost like wearing flip flops. The loose fit caused me issues with my toes rolling over so that I was walking on the sides of them which made for an uncomfortable fit. They are a very warm shoe due to the material they are made from and the lack of ventilation. They are now being relegated to the &#34;quick slip on to get the mail&#34; shoes.	2015-08-14

The strap color are more like a orange rust color, my screen pictured them more brown. I wear 9.5 but ordered a 10 because my exact size wasn't available.

Martial arts shoes are supposed to be form fitting, but I didn't want them too small.  As a woman, I read to purchase 1 full size smaller to compensate for the men's sizing, but then after reading they fit 1/2 size too snug, I ended up only purchasing a 1/2 size smaller.  I'm a woman's 9, so I bought these in 8.5.  They fit PERFECT.  The leather is soft, they fit to my feet without being too snug.  I wore these in a 1 mile parade, that we ended up going about 3 miles that day!  They feel durable and sturdy, I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.

Pros:  Everything About These Shoes are Positive - Workmanship - Style - True to Size - COMFORT (ALL Day comfort...) - Company  Cons:  Only one... that I did not find them sooner.  My feet, and my back have been reborn.  I smile when I put them on, and thank them when I take them off.  Strange, I know... but wait until you try them!  The only reason I marked them as not being a good arch support - - - is because some of us (me) have very high arches and will always need some kind of insert.  I purchased a thin Dr. Sholl's arch support for women that works great. (Purchased at a local store and was unable to locate a comparison here on Amazon...)  On my feet for hours at a time.  Always looking for the shoe that will do... never again.  NEVER bargain with your feet.  These shoes are like the Mercedes Benz of shoes.  A difference I felt immediately.  The first night I wore them I kept saying &#34;I am in LOVE with my shoes....&#34; - - - I was getting strange looks for some reason.  When I said I love them so much I want to marry them... is when they really thought I lost it.  I Was marking the insanity of the world, people wanting to marry landmarks and all.  I was just kidding... (I think.)  The quality is beyond any shoe I've ever worn.  Thank You Ariat!  They value their quality so much, they ask you to register your purchase for warranty...  Now that is a good company!  Thank you Amazon! for the side add that drew my attention in.  This wasn't a planned purchase, however, when Amazon 'showed me' these shoes on the sideline I took a look and that was the beginning of my addiction to the Ariat brand.  Great Purchase !  Highly Recommend...	2015-08-14

The issue with the MW812 is that the maker chose to minimize the top line of the shoe so that it doesn't cover the tongue properly. This is an issue with almost all modern shoes and boots. If you look for old pictures from the early 1900's until about the 1990's notice how close together the sides are. They almost cover the entire tongue. This feature allowed the foot to be cradled in the shoe aiding in lateral support as well as torsional rigidity. The modern method has the left and right side of the shoe trying to work in conjunction with the tongue to accomplish the same thing. It doesn't work as well which results in stressed feet. This lowering of the side is more pronounced on the MW812 than it is on the MW577. I find that the MW577 folds over the top of the foot to a greater degree than the MW812. The major trade off for me is that the foot bed of the MW812 is much more comfortable and gives more support than the MW577 does. Therefore I have bought 2 pairs of the discontinued MW812 shoes based on the foot bed alone and the fact that they are so affordable now. I am getting beyond the short side issue by not wearing my orthotics in them like I can do in my MW577's and I am stretching the straps by readjusting the straps periodically throughout the day.	2015-08-14

I'm a huge fan of aviator shades, and this is my fourth pair. These shades good quality and the shade color I purchased &#34;Flash Maui Sunset&#34;,  is everything I expected and more. They're very cool looking, definitely my new favorite pair of aviators.<br /><br />The outer part is very reflective and is a combination of three colors depending on the angle you're looking at. Looking through them, they really do tint your vision very dark, a pleasant dark color that is slightly orange/yellow, and they're good sun protection (UV 400 Protection) so these are perfect for wearing to the beach. They fit me well, not too loose and not too tight. So overall, I have no complaints. I do recommend carrying a glasses cleaner with you because finger print smudges really do show up on these, and I have a bad habit of accidentally touching the lenses.<br /><br />So overall, I'm very happy with them, they look great.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest unbiased review.	2015-08-14

I had to order the Wide width for my size, and they fit exactly as I expected them to.  I did try them on a few days before purchasing them on Amazon at a shoe store, which helps.<br /><br />understand, I have a very wide, flat foot..... I've joked for years that I was born with snowshoes instead of feet.<br />So, you can imagine, it's hard for me to find shoes that I like and also fit me well.... more often than not I can have one or the other.<br /><br />I get both with these shoes!  And it's awesome.<br /><br />I've had them for almost a year now, and I wear them, nearly, every day.<br /><br />One word of caution though.... I suppose it's simply the nature of the tread pattern and the rubber used to make them, but these shoes DO NOT do well on damp surfaces like smooth asphalt, stone, or concrete...... If it's damp, wet, or raining and you have to get across a parking lot, don't run. walk slowly and just accept that you're gonna get wet.<br /><br />That one caveat will not prevent me from buying another pair when the pair I have finally give up the ghost.	2015-08-14

The shoe still fits great, maybe a little roomier over all.  I ordered exactly my street size.  They perform incredibly well.  I feel like I am cheating when I put these puppies on!<br />My only criticism would be the color.  Not every woman wants to wear pink.  I've worked in outdoor retail for 20 years and I wish vendors would learn this. I loved the old striped ones.  If you have to offer pink, make it an optional color, not the only color you offer. I'll wear these happily, nonetheless, because they perform so well.	2015-08-14

My only complaint is that the soles often come unattached to the inside of the boot and end up sliding around when I'm walking and it's really, really annoying. Also, I suggest you order to your size instead of playing it safe and ordering a size up because I did the latter and they're so huge I can't wear them for very long before my heals hurt	2015-08-14

I don't have wide feet but my arches seem to be a little too higher for these shoes.<br /><br />Because they are so cute I'm going to keep them and see if I can't break them in and gradually get the material to stretch enough to zip closed. The length seems correct for the size and honestly for skinny heels I prefer to wear shoes more on the snug side anyways.	2015-08-14

I just got these sandals today, so I can't speak to their durability, but their initial try on and test-walk went great! They fit true to size (I wear a 7 and have a wide foot) and are very comfortable. I feel way more supported in these than most flip flops/sandals I've had, which is great because I recently sprained my toe - I can walk around well in these without any shooting pain, plus they actually look cute. The only negative thing I can say is that the straps are a bit tight, but I'm sure they'll loosen up with more wearing.	2015-08-14

These shoes are great for lifting  (arms, back, shoulders) or walking, but beware for leg day or running! You might roll your ankle or injure yourself. The upper fabric is a stretchy, elastic material...almost like workout pants. Your foot/toes slide around A LOT and there is very little stability (not in the sole)!

Im an outdoorsman, and am on my feet a lot.  I go through a pair of sandals every summer and finally decided to get a &#34;buy it for life&#34; pair.  After much research on reddit, I decided to go with these. Immediately out of the box I was blown away with the ruggedness of the construction.  They're essentially a vibram sole with a fully adjustable webbing that wraps around your feet.  I knew I couldn't just put these on and start doing my outdoor activities, so I wore them casually for a week or so before wearing them hiking.  After breaking in they basically became the footwear I wear everywhere except the office.  Since purchasing, I've climbed 4 mountains with them with no problems and even started trail running with them.  The toe loop is nice and makes them grip your feet better, but when just camping and chilling next to the fire, I fold the toe loop down so I can wear socks when its cold.  My girlfriend even fell in love with them and got herself a pair.  I will likely wear them through a New England winter and probably wear them to my wedding.  I will be buying them for everyone for Christmas as they are the greatest piece of footwear I own.	2015-08-14

I was looking for something really special to go with a gorgeous blue dress I recently found for my partner. It is a tight number that hugs his curves beautifully so he wanted something that had elegance and style but open to show off his painted nails. After ordering a few different ones it was clear which both he and I preferred! These shoes by Jessica are just so sexy, fit perfectly and have just the right amount of bling to draw attention without being overstated or garish. The heel is high enough to create the right lines without too much of a challenging platform. Suffice to say they are a great purchase and I'm sure he will be looking at others by Jessica. Finally by the amount of time that I see him walking in them it certainly appears that the right decision is made and he reckons they are the most comfortable pair of heels he has. Highly recommended	2015-08-14

These are so cute and look very &#34;realistic&#34; despite the price point. What I really appreciate is the fact that I get tons of compliments every time I wear them. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that I think they could be weighted a bit more. I do have other pairs of cheap fashion glasses that are a bit heavier thus less flimsy so to speak. Other than that, I really can't complain about how amazing these are.<br /><br />UPDATE: Already broken. Only after 3 weeks too. They're so fragile that the slightest manipulation of the temple caused a crack which then made a lens to fall out.	2015-08-14

These boots are simply the best. ♥ They are at an amazing I-honestly-can't-believe-it price and they are only showing any real wear and tear now, a whole year after I bought them. Like other reviewers have said, the spikes are sharp, the better to kick ass with. ;) (But do be careful as I did end up accidentally scratching my uncle's car interior with these bad boys). All in all, an excellent buy, would/and probably will buy again. :D	2015-08-14

I knew I needed a quality boot to get me through the trip, but that ordering something sight unseen was a gamble.  I did some research and purchased the Ahnu Montara because reviewers said it was light weight, supportive and had no break-in time.  These boots are magic!!! From the second I put them on my feet, I was in love. My trip would have been ruined without them! They are comfortable, supportive but not too stiff, lightweight, and they fit like a glove. I did an 11-mile hike in these without ever having worn them before and didn't get a single blister!  I have hiked many miles in them since and they are wearing well. I am an Ahnu customer for life.	2015-08-14

I'm normally a cowboy boot or tennis shoe girl, but the sale price on my size was amazing, so I thought I'd try something a little more fashionable, and I'm so glad I did. They're beautiful boots. The color is very interesting - it's not a true black as it appeared on screen. It's actually an extremely dark brown, and I find it pretty striking and different. Some of the black threading on the shaft has a slight golden shine to it in the lights, which was unexpected and a nice touch. I own several pairs of Ariat's cowboy boots, and these are true to Ariat sizing, which means you may want to order a half size smaller than your street shoe size (I'm a 6 in street shoes but a 5.5 in almost all Ariat boots I've tried on). These are snug at first, as a cowboy boot is, but they are not too tight. My heels do lift out of them slightly when I walk, but not quite as much as they do in most new cowboy boots, and this will wear off as they break in. I have no doubt they will break in very well. The quality is great as with all Ariats, and the Pendleton touch is gorgeous. They're comfortable despite the higher heel than I'm used to, as is expected with ATS footbeds. As others have mentioned, the outsole is very slick, but the heel is rubber so that helps some. Just be a little cautious on really smooth surfaces for a while. Love the fit, love the comfort, love the look, LOVE the price on Amazon for my size. I highly recommend them.	2015-08-14

I was concerned that like most other glitter shoes I would leave a trail of gitter whereever I went. NOPE the glitter stays on the shoe. Awesome! IT is a hard sole but not a noisy shoe. Awesome! There is some cushion so I can wear these all day. Awesome! The one drawback well two small ones.. is that i have to really wrestly the strap to get it to stay in place while I am trying to adjust it to the right hole to buckle. The peg is a smidge short so as you pull the strap tight the peg pops out of the hole. And the height of the side of the shoe hits right under the ankle on the outside of the foot. I put a band aid on the inside of the shoe to keep it from rubbing and it works great. As for the strap minor issue. Overall great shoe and I like it. Shipped fast and packaged up nicely. It was a good purchase. I am satisfied. I am getting what I want from this shoe.	2015-08-14

It's only noticeable if you cover part of the lense, let them sit in the sun and then you can see a fine line between the &#34;light&#34; and &#34;dark&#34;.<br /><br />The lenses are slightly thinner than true Oakleys but fit just fine in the frames. However, I got a little bit of a headache wearing them. I didn't visually notice any distortion, but they must be off just a little bit because after 10 minutes I had to take them off.<br /><br />The normal non-transition Walleva lenses are probably worth a shot for $10, but don't bother with these specifically.	2015-08-14

I bought these for a TK armor build I'm doing, hoping for 501st approval. The boots themselves do look like they'd pass 501st requirements, though not for Level 2 Certification since there is a seam that runs down the front and to the inside of the boot. Definitely not up to the standard of ImperialBoots or TKBoots, but they seem passable if you're stuck for boots.<br />Unfortunately I can't wear them; they're just too big. I normally wear a size 12 shoe, so went with the Large (12-13) in these, but my feet are swimming in them. I imagine that the next size down (M 10-11) will be too small so I'll be returning them and waiting for some from ImperialBoots.	2015-08-14

I'm a NB fan (8+ years) and happened across these in-store. I've put about 200 running miles on them (mostly surfaced road, some trail) and they are heading for retirement this week (replacing with NB). They did wear down a little quicker than I expected. I normally do 5-10 mile runs, so having lasted 200 miles was a bit low compared to other NB shoes I've had. They are a slightly lighter design than I normally buy so I think that had a lot to do with it. I don't have wide feet, but I'm on the larger end of average and the mid through toe box fit perfect for my size (9.5/B). The heal sat a mm or so too large but a simple heal lock fixed that personal problem.Construction wise - great quality! They actually still look pretty close to new in color and fabric! I'll continue to use them as a day-to-day shoe but are too broke down in the heal and sides to support a comfortable run.	2015-08-14

I thought I' try an 8 1/2 since I normally wear an 8 (8 1/2 in some shoes) and some reviewers said they were too small. They are comfortable when first put on, but my toes are up against the front.  In less than 1 hour of wear, these rub against the outer toes especially (even after a month of trying to break them in) and my feet hurt because the arch support is in the wrong place. My feet then have to take a break from the shoes for a few days. I have liked Ryka shoes in the past because they support my feet right, but not this pair!  Choose something else!	2015-08-14

We have used it at pools and in splash pads. The soles are good and provide a nice grip for those slippery, wet surfaces.  We have been using them for about 3 months with no problems.  The &#34;mouth&#34; is a little tight to get his foot in, but no big deal.  The one big complaint though is that we ordered the purple thinking it was going to be more blue/purple.  Definitely more pink/purple, like lavender.  If that is a major concern for you I would not get the purple for a boy then. I am giving it a three because it is exactly what it is suppose to be and did not exceed my mediocre expectations.  If you are looking for a toddler shoe to use for one year, this works well.	2015-08-14

I need a bag that is comfortable to wear, lightweight, and has room for a large wallet, reading glasses, small adresssbook/organizer, etc.  This one is PERFECT!!  Very roomy (and believe me, I like roomy) and well-organized with zippered compartments that let me put things where I can easily find them.

While they worked okay for this purpose, they had a tendency to hold water and let small rocks in around the ankles.<br /><br />I bought my Dad a pair of Outcross Evo 2's for father's day and quickly realized that they are far better suited for river use. They are slightly lighter, drain water well, and have a neoprene liner that prevents rocks from entering around the ankle.<br /><br />In hindsight I wish I would have gotten the Outcross Evo 2's for my intended use, but the Outcross Evo 3's are great for light hiking and creeking. Definitely worth keeping!	2015-08-14

I bought this purse for my sister thinking if it was too small she could use it for formal dinners out.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was much larger than what was pictured.  She loved the purse and is currently using it.  It's only been a few days so I cannot comment on durability but from the onset the purse is well made with a well-sewn lining inside the purse.  The bow and ruffle arrived a bit smashed from packaging and shipping but I assume it'll soften and fall into place with a few days use.  Over all, I would recommend this purse and tell the customer to ignore the size measurements, it is larger than pictured.  If I had to guess, the width is more along the lines of 14 or 15 inches.	2015-08-14

I'm usually a size 8 so that's what I went with . they are a little to big was afraid to change them for the 7 1/2 thinking that then they would be to tight. I added an arch support otherwise I could only wear them for a couple of hours now I can wear them all day. I'm very pleased with the purchase. After writing this I went back and looked at the sneaker and it does have an arch in them just not enough for me.	2015-08-14

Living in Oregon, I already know I'll need to scotch guard them to wear them outside in the wet weather.<br />They are cute and warm, the faux fur inside isn't too plush so your foot doesn't get all sweaty or slip inside the boot when you walk in it.<br />If you intend to wear or walk in these all day, I'd suggest getting arch supports and if the shallow tread is an issue go scuff the bottoms on a curb or other abrasive surface to get 'em to your liking.  I'd recommend these to anyone looking for a simple, stylish boot to go with skinny jeans for winter.<br />The height of the shaft is good, the calf opening isn't too wide and the color is as pictured.  I wear a size 9.5 US and I got a size 10 with these to ensure I can fit thick socks in them if I need to and even though I went up half a size, I'm not catching curbs when I walk :)<br />Love these boots AUSGERFREAKIN' can't wait for fall /winter so I can wear these!!!  Hope this was a helpful review :)	2015-08-14

My husband is normally a size 9 to 9.5 in sneakers, so we ordered both and returned the pair that didn't fit. They ended up fitting a tad large so he stuck with the size 9. They are nice looking sneakers and he reported them as being very comfortable. Don't mind the oversized socks in the picture, we can buy shoes that fit, but clearly not socks!	2015-08-14

The H3 model name means this shoe has stability support (arch and pronation) and maximum cushioning. Other Pearl Izumi shoes have less cushioning and less support, which may be more appropriate for some people. My feet need the extra support and I've been having a hard time finding shoes with both support and cushioning. These shoes have both to keep my feet happy on long runs. The sole is pretty soft, so durability is questionable.<br /><br />Sizing is a little larger than the New Balance shoes that I've been using (size 9), but not enough bigger for me to switch to a smaller size.	2015-08-14

I thought maybe it would be better to have a wallet with a clear-cover for my driver's license ID, but then I thought, maybe this is more secure, in case the ID has something RF readable, and in reality, I don't have to show my ID very often anyway, so it's no big problem to pull it out. The leather is nice, and I'm glad I picked this one. True, it's larger than some other tri-folds, but not a problem with any of my pockets. I have been using rubber-bands to mold it in around the edges, as other reviewers mentioned. Very good to have so many slots to keep cards organized. I used to keep many more cards in each slot in a wallet that did not have as many slots, but note you can put more than 1 card in each slot in this one as well. They are very tight, but I'm sure they will loosen up over time.	2015-08-14

They have good support and good cushioning when you're walking on asphalt. However, it's difficult to get the laces tighter. For some reason, you have to tighten along the laces from the bottom and then go up. It took me a while to figure out how to get the laces to work the way that I wanted them to.<br /><br />The muscles on the bottom of my feet hurt when I do cardio so I thought that the arch support would help. Not so in this case. My feet were burning about 1/2 mile into my walk but they adjusted. I'll keep wearing them to see if breaking them in will help.	2015-08-14

When I first got them I debated on sending them back. I am a huge fan of comfort, but I am also a huge fan of shoes. SO I kept them and in truth the more I wear them the more pliable the outside of the shoe becomes. The way to my heart is shoes and these have found a place. I am happy. If you have sensitive feet I'd keep looking but it all depends on which outweighs the other for me my vainity outweighed so I love the shoes. I did take one star off just for the comfort level. They are FAB though.	2015-08-14

I received my Dawgs yesterday and let me start with, I am sooooo glad I did not listen to the negative reviews. I have been searching for a pair of lightweight/comfortable slip on sandals for months now. I have spent ridiculous amounts on name brand sandals only to be disappointed. You see I have Osteoarthritis in both feet along with P.F./spurs. Diagnosed in March 2015 and have been so miserable. I am on my feet constantly and at work I have to be barefooted walking on wood flooring. Since I cannot be without some kind of shoes I have been granted to wear sandals. Every single one left me hurting by the end of the day and my feet/ankles would swell causing me to succumb and refuse to want to walk later that day. Sometimes going into the next day. Anyways, today I wore my new Dawgs all day and I am so happy to say, no swelling and very minimal pain. This sandals are heaven sent and I recommend them to people with feet issues. Pictures are of what my feet look like by the end of the day without the Dawgs n look at the difference with the Dawgs. If this isn't proof than I don't know what to say... I love my Dawgs n ordering more...	2015-08-14

It is Aug.,2015 and my cable just died. I could hear no one talking during the game. The sound of the game was coming through with no problem, it was just that I could not communicate, or hear anyone communicating. I think that it is actually not the cable, but the controller part for listening/talking to people. I just ordered THREE of these puppies, for pickup at my local Walmart, for $9.95 each. They are the Turtle Beach cables, not a knock-off/generic. I don't want to take any chances for the future, as Turtle Beach is currently out-of-stock on the cables.  There are way too many people that have had their cable die on them.  I have to believe that this is a bad design, which Turtle Beach should have corrected, long ago.  They have a good headset and strap this cheapo/defective cable to it--why?  It would seem that Turtle Beach is not interested in product quality, only product sales.  For all of the people that have given a lot of stars to this product, I have to wonder if they are reacting to the replacement solely from its' arrival and first use.  What happens after that?  Many have stated that it starts off o.k., and then essentially stops working, just like the original cable.  This essentially means that you have to keep a stock pile of cables handy, as you KNOW that the cable is going to fail at some point.  Turtle Beach is making money off the cables, by having a defective product, which people have to get, if they want to continue using their headsets.  I currently would tell folks to look for a better quality headset, and not purchase the Turtle Beach ones, unless you don't mind continually replacing the cable.  Depending on how often you had to replace the cable, this cost could add up.	2015-08-14

I have been searching for the best VR goggles and have tried several.  Each one has its advantages and disadvantages.  This one is made well and a great deal for the price.  It has the ability to focus similar to a pair of binoculars so it works for most people and with most VR apps.  The head strap is wonderful.  The padding around the face and nose is fantastic for wearing them a long time. On the negative side I have found that Google Cardboard and DoDo Cardboard cases give the viewer a more immersive viewing experience.  The plastic headsets that I have tried seem to cause the image you are looking at to be surrounded by a border making the experience more like watching a movie and less like being immersed in virtual reality.  I have a Galaxy Note 3 so it isn't a small screen size causing the issue.  I do like these goggles. They are made well and the phone is secure inside so no one would fumble and drop the phone.  I just wish there was a way to remove the border around the screen when looking through them.	2015-08-14

Upon first inspection the headset seems good quality. They have a good weight to them and are fairly comfortable even after several hours of continuous use. Sound is actually very good and I noticed sounds I had not heard previously on same game. That is why I gave more than One star. The reason this headset didn't get Five stars is because the microphone is garbage. I am an average size man with an average size face and the retractable mic doesn't extend out far enough to pick up the sound coming from my lips. The only way I can get the mic to pick me up is by offsetting the headset and moving the left cup forward off my ear so the mic can reach my mouth. Very disappointed by this and makes the headset useless. Probably good for a 10 year olds face size but not much else.	2015-08-14

I bought two pads for temporary use until I save enough money for a decent metal pad. These pads take some getting used to along with the sensitivity of the arrows. It doesn't take much to activate. I am a very skilled DDR player that has passed Max 300 on heavy with a AA and play doubles on heavy. Not saying that justifies my skill, but showing you the speed of songs at which I was used to. This pad moves A LOT for anyone who is a skilled player. Playing Exotic Ethnic on Heavy, started in front of the TV, ended up facing to the right about 45degrees and to the left about 1 foot; but I am playing on a decently thick carpet, so that is the main reason why it moves  A LOT. Other than that, this will last a decent bit until I get a metal pad. Maybe 3-6 months of heavy use, I will be playing everyday after wor to get my endurance back. I have over 300+ Konami official songs, including Supernova 1 and 2; I have all the songs from &#34;In The Groove&#34; 1 and 2.<br /><br />Another thing that I hope the seller can contact me on (I'll message him) but one of the pads has a very sticky and randomly activated down arrow. I use MotionJoy to map the pad as a XBox 360 controller so I can do jump arrows and what not so I know it isn't a mapping issue. I noticed when I stop playing during a song that when I stand on the left arrow, the down arrow gets triggered too. It consistently triggers without even touching the down arrow, I'm sure it is the pad malfunctioning.<br /><br />It's a cheap pad just to get started and it will last roughly under a year, or more if you are a starter at the game.	2015-08-14

Received my PS2 network adaptor as pictured.  I had mine ordered from &#34;itembazaar&#34; and they did an amazing job of packaging my item even though it wasn't really necessary since this unit is pretty cheap to begin with.  You'll only really need to buy this if you want to complete your PS2/collection or to use it to install a HDD to decrease load times and whatever you please.  I've read that some network adaptors don't come with both ports but the one I ordered came with both ports but that doesn't matter either because this is again either for collecting or completing your PS2 and for HDD access.  Unit still works and had no problem with hooking up to my hard drives that I have.  In the end I was more than happy.  Again if you're looking for a legit source for the network adapter then I would recommend &#34;itembazaar&#34; excellently priced and great packaging.<br /><br />***** IMPORTANT *****  If you're looking to buy this then please remember that you will need either the OFFICIAL Sony Playstation 2 HDD or a compatible IDE drive.  The latter is the only real better and easier choice.	2015-08-14

A very specific crowd will enjoy this title while the rest will not. The &#34;grind&#34; aspect that is repeated activity, which is often looked negatively upon in other games, is the bread and butter here. Good with that? Well all right, welcome to Story of Seasons. Reviews for this genre of game really don't have much to go on with the normal listing. Sound/music, for example, is not a strong-suit here... but it would probably have never even been something considered. Those types of categories are simple to respond to in that they're good enough to say that it's fitting.<br /><br />Are you familiar with Harvest Moon? To sum up, you own a rundown or vacant plot of land to do with what you want. In the case of Story of Seasons, the goal that the game has for you is to make the town popular by managing to trade (i.e. sell your goods) with other towns that interact with yours in the form of a trade depot. More trading means more notoriety, which then means more people will want to visit and trade with the town. While this is a consistent objective, the truth is that you're simply let loose to have your own goals. Want to get to know the townsfolk better? Give them gifts and interact with them to build relationships. Want to form a romantic relationship (or relationships if that's your thing, despite consequence), get married, have a family? Just like in Harvest Moon, go right ahead. Likewise if all you want to do is make a robust farm.<br /><br />The gameplay is very repetitive, but that's exactly what you should expect from this genre. It's about keeping your crops alive and maintaining an income to afford new seeds, structures, furnishing, livestock, blueprints, recipes, etc. Most crops and goods have quality ratings to them that increase the sale value the higher the rating goes. You accomplish this by fertilizing crops or by other means.<br /><br />When you first start the game, there will be two difficulty choices. They REALLY make a difference for your experience early into the game, but those differences start to become smaller as time goes on (in that, eventually, the normal mode isn't as difficult to work with as the easy mode). You'll find that there really isn't a whole lot to do when you are let loose after the tutorial period. Not a lot of money and, if you're playing normal, your stamina drains so very fast when taking actions or cleaning up your land. Eventually though, this will start to change as you manage to sell more and more. As seasons change, so too will your crop selection, as certain goods can only be grown during specific times of the year.<br /><br />A big part of the charm are those interactions with the townsfolk. There's a relationship system for all characters that will increase/decrease depending on your actions (notably choices during cutscenes or daily gifts you give). After you reach a certain point, you'll be able to view a cutscene about this character and learn more about them. Depending on whether or not you are a male or female character, eligible bachelors and bachelorettes are present in the game for you to woo (or crash and burn if you're bad at the game of love).<br /><br />Story of Seasons is really a game that you pick up and relax to. It's not groundbreaking in any way, but it's also not bad because of that. It's simple and straightforward in how you play, but complex enough in certain areas that you might feel invested enough to do better than before. By the end of the first year in the game, there's so much to do in a given game day, that you'll laugh at how drastic of a shift it can be (depending on how you decide to build up the farm). I play it almost daily for ~1hr, and haven't really gotten bored of it since I bought it when it came out. Again though, it's definitely not a game for everyone, but it's not a bad entry to how farming sims work... as long as you pick the easy mode if you're completely new to the genre and afraid to make mistakes.	2015-08-14

While the game is still pretty fun by itself, there isn't much of a reliance on the farming system. The game is just centered more around completing dungeons and progressing through the story. Moreover, it's only until the endgame in which you're allowed to actually progress your relations with the marriage candidates; up until then you would only be advancing your friendships. Yet, it does also give you the chance to take the male or female route to pursue the different candidates.	2015-08-14

Set a trend in the office with these. Takes some getting used to with the slight magnification but if you suffer from headaches, eye exhaustion at night or insomnia these WILL help. I use them mainly for the headache thing. Im in sales and I stare at a computer screen all day selling real estate investments so i tend to get headaches frequently, along with blurry vision while driving at night. Using these regularly has done away with the bad vision at night and if I start to get a headache at work because I forgot to rock them, I just put them on and maybe a half hour later its gone. Makes the screen much more readable and clear. You will be surprised at the difference. Cant knock it till you try it!! Several coworkers have bought pairs and others sometimes ask to borrow them. They will make you look like a nerd/boss.	2015-08-14

It's like they took everything great about Arkham City, took half of it away, and added in the Batmobile which is REQUIRED for a good portion of the game. Takes out the idea that you have options at your disposal, which should be Batman's forte. That's the main complaint with the game.<br /><br />Other than that, it's just uninspired. The story has little to no draw and feels more like filler. I mean, after Arkham City it is obviously hard to make a decent follow up but still. The game is okay as a mediocre action game but it isn't really an Arkham game. Just doesn't have the feel anymore.	2015-08-14

That's how bad this game is. But I will try to be fair and list what I liked and not just what I didn't like:<br /><br />Pro:<br />- The battle system was interesting.<br />- I liked that I could control the XP/Money/Health bonus<br />- Star Ocean's crafting is always fun<br /><br />Con:<br />- Terrible voice acting. - If this came came out in 2000 then you can make allowances but dammit, I expect better acting than this. Metal Gear Solid 1 was on the PS1 and it's acting was excellent!<br />- Awful characters - Imagine every lame ass anime trope and cliche crammed into one game. Yup, those are your characters: the brash and inexperienced hero, the shy childhoodfriend/romance object, cat girl, obligatory child prodigy, big robot guy... Lame.<br />- Having only 3 basic attacks got pretty boring. You can button mash your way through every fight in the game, except bosses.<br />- EVERY CUT SCENE MAKES ME WANT TO SLIT MY OWN THROAT - Over the top acting, high pitch annoying voices, completely stilted dialogue.<br />- Ham-handed exposition<br /><br />My advice to Square: Gamers playing Star Ocean aren't 10 years old anymore. You cant just cobble together a crappy script, last gen graphics, poor actors, and cliche after cliche and expect us to swallow it.	2015-08-14

Made by Madcatz, just under a different name.  Quality SUCKS.  Charging base developed a contact problem after only 2 months of service and had to be replaced.  Six months later, the mic wires developed a short because the flexible wire protector that swivels with it is a pisspoor design, and isn't engineered with enough slack to keep from stressing out the wires internally--which causes wire severing.  After several &#34;tickets&#34; submitted for this issue with the Madcats.com website (that's the only way they'll deal with warranty problems), I was told that they quit making these, and they have no more replacement for them.  All they would do for me was replace them with another model, that wasn't wireless, and sold for HALF as much.  No thanks.  I asked for a refund.  They refused.  I'm still trying to resolve this issue, but they told me that since I bought it on Amazon, that<br />I will have to take it up with them.  Sorry people, but Amazon isn't the one who is supposed to take care of the warranties for the customers who shell out over $150 for each pair of these for 2 years.  TERRIBLE customer service and support.  TERRIBLE quality.  Obsolete item and not fixable anymore.  DONT BUY THESE!	2015-08-14

See attached photo for sample.	Received and Used Product on 8/12/2015<br />- Cooling fan sucks air from bottom<br />- Cooling fan is very quiet<br />- USB ports all function (tested by plugging in my headset in all USB ports)<br />- Both controller charging outputs function in charging controllers (USB Minis are sturdy but not indestructible, so carefully place controller in charging bay and carefully remove it)<br />- Power button operates well<br /><br />Everything matched the description, except for a deceiving image layout that didn't match what Seller posted. I've sent them image feedback.<br />Other customers received a version without a logo, which was what I was expecting. Their logo really removes the flush design that was advertised in photos. See attached image for reference on what version I received. It's a glaring blue image that doesn't fit the design at all. There was also a drop of blue paint in the controller bay, which also ruins the design, but not the function.<br /><br />Personal opinion, I really hate this new version change up. Especially since my primary reason I purchased this was for its design.	2015-08-14

Yes this game has some *risky* content and suggestive themes but it doesn't overpower the character. The rating clearly states M with tue reasoning. I don't understand why so many reviewers are surprised about the content of the game. This is really the first game series that captured my full attention. The story is incredibly compelling and all of the characters are endearing in their own special way. Bayonetta may be seen in provocative poses in the game but she fights her own battles and kicks butt every time. She is a strong character and not once is she in a *provocative position* without her consent. She remains in control of her body and actions through the duration of the game. I  haven't been able to stop playing since I bought the game. The art style is beautiful and I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fantasy and magic worlds.	2015-08-14

I ordered this hard cover for my &#34;New&#34; 3DS XL, and it fits perfectly. The case is imported from Japan and is labeled for the &#34;New&#34; 3DS LL. They are the same thing.<br /><br />Unlike the product photo (or my screen), the coveris not mint green. It is a pale baby blue. The shell is thin and made of hard plastic. It snaps onto the 3DS easily and fits snugly. It is also easy to remove should you ever have to.<br /><br />The design on the cover is painted on, and I suspect that it will chip eventually due to regular use. However, I have been taking my 3DS with me everywhere for the past week and a half, and it is still in prefect condition. The cover is very high quality, and I know it will last a long time.<br /><br />** It should be noted that this product is for the &#34;New&#34; 3DS XL (the newer model of the 3DS) and not the original 3DS XL... in case it was too hard to read the many &#34;New&#34; 3DS LL labels on this product/in the description, or to look at the pictures provided and see the additional buttons/different port locations on the console.	2015-08-14

Update: its head band have broken on both sides above the ear cuffs. Definitely wants tested well with lifespan after 8 months. I've tried to use epoxy to connect them back but they keep breaking. The plastic that they used was not meant to be bent that much. I would not buy this or anything made of the same quality of plastic. Look for something that has a metal rim to bend.<br /><br />I'm basing this off of playing Destiny and watching movies with the Playstation Gold Headset for over a year.<br />7/10 sound<br />8/10 mic<br />7/10 comfort<br />4/10 usability/practicality<br />8/10 setup<br />-/10 lifespan<br /><br />Sound - I work in video production so I've got an ear for sound quality. This thing, even with the bass boos preset does not have the fidelity of the PS Gold Headset. I switched between the Surround Sound and Stereo settings (because if find most 7.1 SS headsets to be hallow) and no noticeable increase in quality. I do like the fine tuning it gives you with chat and game volume.<br />Mic - the mic is pretty nice, easy to move around and good quality. I notice some people don't like the monitoring but i do. It picks up more specifically on peaking and when your breathing into the mic. the stuff thats annoying to hear from other people. you won't hear your own voice much though, which i find to be fine.<br />Comfort - its a little tight. i ware glasses and have yet to be in pain from it but its a noticeable difference and does make me fee like there is a bit of pressure on my head. But after 8 hours of use it didn't become unbearable, just noticeable.<br />Usability - The presets might as well just not exist. it would be more helpful to get complete control of the EQ to make them usable. like i said about the sound, very little differences in settings. I'm not a fan of the blinking LED logo that is on while the headset is powered on. I thought it was pairing at first then read it was the normal sign that it was on (considering putting tape over the LEDlogos) the adjustments for headsize are too tight to adjust while its on your head. you need to take it off to adjust. There is no way to gauge battery life outside of its audio queues of &quot;fully charged&quot; and &quot;battery life low&quot;. The PS Gold headset would show battery life on screen if you hit the dashboard, same as how it shows your controller's life.<br />Setup - the only reason i'm giving it a 8/10 is that i have to unplug the USB dongle to switch from headset audio to TV audio. outside of that the setup is pretty quick and easy.<br />Lifespan - i've only had it for a month so i've not noticed a decrease or major issue with charge time or battery life. Advertised life on the box says 15 hours. i get closer to 8 when playing and chatting. still thats pretty long.<br /><br />Verditc - Dont get the Surround Sound version. hardly noticeable VS stereo mode. Get the PS Gold Headsets. They are almost the same price and just work better. Only reason i got these was that the bands that compress the PS headset's earcups broke on my old pair (i may have been a little too rough with them, but i've had them since PS4 came out, so thats a good lifespan)	2015-08-14

I’m male gamer in late twenties, have been playing video games for the past 15 years.<br /><br />First time writing a game review, overall the concept/historical representation of the game is solid but the transition of the games play/character development and dialogue is clear lack of.<br /><br />I have played most Assassins Creed games, as I consider myself an occasional gamer.<br /><br />Just put in 4 hours into the game and first impressions of it are mostly positive. Despite the long scene loading times, the game looks just like previous games in the franchise. When it comes to graphics I did notice smoother pixels in the characters and buildings [great balance of light and shadow: makes everything more vivid and life looking] I do play all my games on a SAMSUNG 4K UHD TV.<br /><br />When it comes to combat for most part it is fluid and the controls are straight forward, I did notice when fighting multiple enemies in a small surroundings, it can be more challenging targeting enemies one by one. Running and claiming is much exciting/faster to experience compared to past games, as it more easily to move throughout the environment bouncing off objects and pillars.<br /><br />I was especially impressed of the audio sound in the game throughout different part of the levels. One example of this is: when running down the stairs you can hear swords swinging and bombs exploding, getting louder and echoing thought-out the hall ways, making the play through very believable. I did see some voice glitches when multiple character are trying to talk at once – in my gameplay this happened very little, but I had to note this.<br /><br />The game is not worth its full $60 value but defiantly a must play for $19 which is the price Amazon has it listed.<br /><br />Looking forward to playing Assassin's Creed Syndicate and see how the Franchise is going to take the open-word character customizability game experience to the next level. Do not disappoint your gamers UBI Soft.<br /><br />I would recommend playing this game and not getting discouraged from the negative reviews written. Will continue to play the game and will update when I beat it....><br />I would recommend playing this game and not getting discouraged from the negative reviews written.

The audio quality is good and the mic works fine and for the first month or two it worked fine. It's a very comfortable headset as well so I really wanted to like it. After a while though the headset would just stop functioning every so often(none of the buttons worked). You can't even turn it off. I wish I would have checked for problems regarding this headset before I bought it because that was a common problem. The only solution I could find for the problem was to let the battery die out and then charge it. The other problem I had with it was the ear pads. I know that this is a problem for other headphones as well, but why do i need to remove a plastic ring to get the ear pads back on easily  after cleaning (I didn't take mine off cause it ruins the warranty). I thought it was common knowledge that you should clean the ear pads every now and then so why not make it easier to take them on and off.  Once again this headset works great when it works, its just that it has so many problems, it isn't worth the $250 at this time. If they updated the software for it, I'd probably bump it up to 4 stars and recommend it to, but right now i wouldn't buy it again and i wouldn't tell anyone else to buy it either.	2015-08-14

Charge up to two Xbox One Controllers Simultaneously	Video Games	5	0	0	N	Y	Let's clear something's up	So I received this product on 08/08/2015 and wanted to try it for a bit before I made a review. My first impressions, this charger is excellent. I'll go ahead and review a few of this devices qualities.<br /><br />1. Price - I believe the price is very fair, it comes with two rechargeable battery units along with the dock, considering a unit like this in stores cost about $30-$40, I figured this was definitely a great buy<br /><br />2. Looks - This looks great ! I like to keep my entertainment center looking tip top, and this sleek design with illuminated lights compliments my set up wonderfully<br /><br />3. Functionality - So upon reading some of these reviews I was a bit skeptical about this product. For instance; short charge retention, difficulty removing battery unit, dock stops working, etc. However, upon using this unit I have experienced none of those problems. The battery pack is easy to take on and off, you do exactly what you would do if you were removing the Xbox battery cover. Even my 6 year old nephew can do it, no reason why you guys can't. The battery life is great ! My controllers are fully charged in about an hour and the battery last a while. I am a huge fan of ARPG, so I literally spend hours gaming, that being said, I can game for several days before having to recharge. As far as the life of the dock goes, I can not say because I've only had it for about a week, so I have no thoughts on that.<br /><br />In summary, it's a wonderful charging docks and definitely worth the price. I was completely satisfied with the shipping and the price. I would recommend you pick this up, definitely worth it !<br /><br />(also the light is very bright, and doesn't turn off when there are no devices charging, it doesn't bother me, but for those who keep there consoles in their rooms, this may cause an issue)	2015-08-14

I've never been so disappointed with a product.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Fits nicely on head<br />Comfortable over ear<br />Nice Sound Quality<br /><br />You'd think with those good features that it would get a good review, but I just can't do it.  When it works, it's great, the problem is that about half the time it doesn't work and the mic doesn't receive sound at all.  If you try to unplug and reset the mic, 9 times out of 10, you'll lose complete control of your xbox.  This means the only way to get control of your xbox again is to completely shut it off and back on.  When you only have an hour to game and you spend 50 minutes getting your mic working it sucks ... every time.<br /><br />If you want to just listen, go ahead, but if you like to use your headset to chat, save yourself the trouble and under no circumstances should you ever consider buying this headset.	2015-08-14

I used the stick for about three days before sending it back because the 'Share' button would occasionally activate without pressing it during gameplay. I can't say if the issue is widespread as I only tested one unit, but even if I were to judge it without taking the defect into account, my experience with the stick convinced me to get a refund instead of a replacement.  Hori has opted to use their own proprietary joystick and pushbuttons, Hayubasa and Kuro respectively, instead of the standard Sanwa parts. Fortunately, the Hori parts are of good quality. Whether you like them or not will come down entirely to personal preference. As far as the stick is concerned, I found the engage and throw distances a bit too long, but again, that's just preference. The only real difference I noticed was that the Hayabusa is a tad stiffer than the JLF, but honestly you probably won't notice or care about the minute differences between it and the Sanwa. If you like the JLF, you'll probably like the Hayabusa. The pushbuttons feel somewhere between Sanwa and Seimitsu in terms of resistance, with Sanwa being the most sensitive, the Kuro slightly less so, and Seimitsu buttons being the stiffest of the three brands. All in all, the Hayabusa joystick and Kuro buttons are perfectly competent components. But together they can be had for around $50 retail if you were to buy the joystick and buttons separately. The cost to Hori, not including the case and wiring, is a fraction (probably 1/3, around $15-$20) of that seeing as they manufacture the parts themselves. So where is the rest of your money going?  The one thing that this stick has going for it is that includes a touchpad, which the latest Madcatz sticks still lack as of this review (update: they now come with touchpads). Beyond that though, Hori went cheap with the rest of the fightstick, straight up. The moststriking example is the thin, flimsy cord compartment door. Any pressure from the cord will have it open if not entirely pop out of its hinges. Additionally, the casing itself feels like it's made of lightweight cheap plastic. As another reviewer mentioned, the RAP 4 Kai does not feel like a $150 controller. Unfortunately, I can't tell you anything about the internals because opening the stick voids the warranty.  Besides the low-quality build, Hori made some questionable design decisions with this stick. For starters, the 'Option' button is large and placed right on the face next to the functional buttons making it very easy to accidentally hit it during a match. Moreover, the porous black plastic on the majority of the stick is a  magnet for finger grease that's really difficult to clean. Additionally, the RAP 4 is not mod friendly in the least. You'll need to remove numerous screws, and subsequently screw them all back in, to get at the internals. Lastly, the switches, L3, R3, PS, Share, and Turbo buttons are placed on the right side of the stick, out of view, which means that if you need to flip a switch or press one of these buttons you'll have to turn the stick sideways to find the correct one.  When compared to the $200+ Madcatz sticks, the RAP 4 Kai seems like a good value, but this is an illusion. Both the RAP4 and Madcatz TE2 are overpriced, the TE2 especially. Currently, no manufacturer is offering a fightstick for the PS4 that is worth the premium price they're asking. The RAP4 needs to be either cheaper in price or higher in quality.  EDIT: I raised it a star  EDIT 2: Had to lower it back to 2/5 after experiencing the exact same 'Share' button issue with a friend's stick.  So TL;DR: It's a competent, if flawed, entry-level stick provided you get one that isn't defective.	2015-08-14

This stick is ok. The good thing I like about the stick is its kinda close to my Fighters Edge in functionality. It allows me to do button assignment which I use to assign (Select/Touch pad) to the L1/L2 buttons for USF4. The bad things are the stick lever is really loose in comparison to my fighters edge. I had to go purchase a tighter spring to make the lever movement require a bit more force. The buttons on this stick are very cheap. They do not have rounded edges like sanwa buttons and are very hard to the touch. So pretty much if you purchase this stick and you are a seasoned fighting game player, you most likely are going to be spending 20 - 40 dollars extra to mod it.	2015-08-14

One being the tab that holds the pcb board in (not a big deal it stays put pretty easy). The second one being one of the nubs that the eject button connects to which make the eject button not work and I had to glue it in.<br /><br />Like I said The drive works, but the plastic casing is awful. ..	2015-08-14

Beautiful graphics, seamless game play and more abilities and action than one has time for. The open world online aspect makes has a World of Warcraft feel, mixed with Halo style shooting and Borderlands abilities has all the parts to be an amazing game and yet it comes up short. The campaign is way too short, player vs player battles are frustrating unless you are a high level.  My other big problem is the lack of instructions. If it wasn't for an online friend I would have been lost the whole time. Barely a tutorial with little to no explanation for what is happening and why you are doing it leaves one wanting. All I knew is I was collecting things, killing aliens and leveling up for it (once again a great premise) but with expectations as high as they were this game failed to meet them.	2015-08-14

I flipped the fans and added some spacers to the bottom for air flow. This seems to work well. The fans create a bit of noise, but its manageable. The issue I'm having is the USB hub continuously disconnects and connects. My USB wired head set will be sporadically working, disconnect  for 30secs to a few minutes and reconnect. Same issue with the USB cable I use to charge my controller while playing. I'm worried that my controller on the stand is having the same issue, but I don't have a way to test it. Work around would be to use a separate USB hub and not use the one on this item at all.	2015-08-14

Finally got around to playing this, and it's not a whole lot different than the prior version... more stuff here, but essentially the same story.  I probably would love this game, as it feels scary, mysterious and exciting.  But there are just a couple of things that lower my rating.  First, the quarter turn viewpoint is terrible because you cannot really check out if you are in the perfect spot, or an &#34;okay&#34; spot, in relation to the enemy.  This should be like most computer games that have 360 smooth rotation and you can stop it anywhere.  Secondly I seem to always have problems getting a soldier to climb a ladder and get onto a roof.  When it works, it's cool, but most of the time, my solder moves to another location on ground level and if there are enemies nearby, chances are, they are fully exposed.  The last gripe I have is that every time you tell a solder to get ready to fire at anything that moves, it forces you to click on an &#34;OK&#34; box, as there is a message that describes about what you just selected, and do you want to do that for sure.  When you're first learning, that is good.  But when you KNOW what you want to do, which is the case 99.99% of the rest of the time in the game, that box SHOULD NOT pop up.<br /><br />On the good side, the explosions are pretty, the story is pretty good, although a little &#34;hammy&#34; with the heavy German accent of the Head of Research (which is very humorous.  (fyi: I'm of German descent and have nothing against Germans!)  And then there's the head of Manufacturing, which I tell you, looks uncannily like Dick Cheney!<br /><br />It's a hard game, even on Easy.	2015-08-14

Getting to know the characters was also fun,but it broke my heart when I had to kill off someone I really liked. The members that you must kill are randomized, so you won't play the game the same way twice. I highly recommend picking this one up.	2015-08-14

I've had the game for close to a year now- got it on release day, a waste- and honestly I've never been able to get past the first section of the thing. Below is a list of the points that have killed this franchise for me- and possibly turned me away from Bioware and EA entirely.<br /><br />-1-  My biggest problem was with the amount of crashes and bugs within the game. And this is despite the patches and updates. The audio files all but crashed the entire game, the cut scenes ran about as well as reading a comic(absolutely no fps so I skipped or forced a skip if the cut scene wouldn't allow it), there were triggers for cut scenes that never triggered(what stands out quite a bit is the actual intro, in which my character was stranded inside a desolate caldera, unable to move forward as it flagged me as &#34;currently in a cut scene&#34;), -and god forbid you if you try and customize your character with more than a different hair color! It actually killed- and killed as in, windows OS entirely cracking and wiping everything within my HDD- my other laptop when I was trying to make a character.<br />-2- The open world-ness. The ridiculous amount of fetch quests and absolutely unrewarding objectives that were scattered throughout a massive map killed the urgency that seemed prevalent to the previous games(&#34;ooh my! You have miss-placed your cattle on the other side of the map! Let me and my merry band of dolts fetch them for you!&#34;). Honestly, whenever I sloughed through the time it took to open the map, I amused my self by thinking some project manager had simply put the map on a wall and thrown darts to pick objective locations.<br />-Thats it- I could go on, but that should be enough. Keep in mind, the game is lacking in everything its predecessors made great and it has almost zero playablilty. If you want a good paper weight with a Dragon Age series theme, get this game! Its great at just sitting there!!	2015-08-14

I did a fair amount of research, and most of the reviews are excellent.  First off, my #1 criteria was sound quality.  I was looking for the best sound, without spending almost as much on a headset as I did on the PS4.  These seemed to fit the bill.  During my research, I had found people recommending buying a sound processor and a decent pair of headphones instead.  Since I already had a decent pair of stereo phones (Sony MDR-7506), I decided to also get the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS 7.1 Surround Sound Processor (I also had the necessary optical audio cord, and mini USB power cord), and do a side-by-side test just for fun.  Holy crap was the difference night and day.  I listened to the Playstation Gold headset first, and it sounded good until I plugged the MDR-7501s into the processor.  The 7501s absolutely blew the golds away.  No contest.  Side-by-side, the Golds are flat, dull, and muffled while the MDRs were crisp, loud, and dynamic.  If you are looking for immersion, buy yourself a decent pair of headphones (not Beats by Dre), and get a standalone processor.  Sure, it's not wireless, but if your main goal is great sound quality and immersion, you can't go wrong.	2015-08-14

Batman Arkham Knight has a lot of good going for it and some things that are bad for it as well. Sadly, the good things about this game have been done before in the previous versions and the things that bring this game down, REALLY bring it down.<br /><br />First the good: The graphics and and gameplay remain great and the graphics really shine on the consoles but of course it is at 30fps. I imagine that the freeflow combat would have been amazing to see even more if it was 60fps but we gotta deal with the limits of our next gen consoles, oh well. It is still satisfying to be Batman and fight like an intelligent, skillful and fearless fighter and also glide around the city.<br /><br />Sadly, those are the only good things I can think of about this game but let's be honest, the same good things in Arkham Knight were also done in Arkham City. As awesome as it feels to be Batman, it also feels like the developers didn't know, forgot how to or just didn't care to give Batman competition this time around. All of Batman's infamous enemies that you come across, don't feel special at all this time around. In previous games, there were boss fights but in this game there are pretty much none.<br /><br />Even when I thought there was going to be a boss battle either it became a simple takeout like any other grunt soldier, then cut scene then Batman takes them to jail or it is a boring tank battle, cut scene and Batman takes them to jail. There are no epic or memorable fights in this games, just some memorable cut scenes.The enemy who will give you the most trouble will be The Riddler because of his tedious riddles and trophies which by the way, you have to collect all of them this time around to get the complete ending. I feel that is a horrible way to acquire the most complete ending. Me and I feel most other people out there who have a lot of games to play or limited time, would rather Youtube the ending then putting in frustrating amounts of time to do something as tediousas collecting trophies throughout a huge area over 200 times just to get the most satisfying ending.<br /><br />After viewing the complete ending on Youtube (because I just didn't want to be bothered with the Riddler trophies) I can say it wasn't worth the effort that the developers expect of the player to achieve it. The story itself before the ending was actually pretty good overall. Not great but entertaining to say the least. The ending combined with a strong emphasis on the Batmobile/tank battles really bring this game down. As for the replay value, it may always be fun to fight as Batman but it eventually gets old and after the complete ending there are only challenges left to do but those are even more frustrating and tedious than The Riddler trophies. I also had problems trying to play the DLC stories. Apparently it is a common problem that these can't be accessed after we redeemed and installed them. I tried restoring my licenses on my PS4 but I still wasn't allowed to play the Harley Quin and Red Hood story packs. My interest in this game died completely after I got one of the endings but that isn't to say it wasn't all bad . I just don't recommend this as a $60 buy.	2015-08-14

All the equalizers in the game are based on kill streaks, which once one falls behind they typically get left behind (pirate code). The great part of this game is no matter how bad one is doing, every three minute, give or take, you get to call down a giant robot and run around and wreak havoc.<br /><br />Mixed in with a bunch of unlockables for load outs (similar to call of duty) for both your person and Titan (giant robotic killing machine) this game is a lot of fun to play. The only place it falls short is the campaign. In a typical unreal tech fashion they neglected to make a true campaign. Instead of a story you just play the computer in multiplayer games and win or lose you move on to the next. More of a single player mode than a campaign. With so much potential for an awesome story, it would have been nice if they bothered to make one.	2015-08-14

After installing the drive it works great and so far has about 20 hours of play time and is still functioning without issue.

However, if you have played Far Cry 3, you might be disappointed by how similar the two are in game play. (even though Far Cry 3 was a superb game in itself)<br />Here are some of the &#34;upgrades&#34;:<br />1. Buzzer: No more driving miles just to get to the next outpost or tower. Just fly around in your private little buzzing flying machine!<br />2. Elephants: You can break into an outpost sitting on an elephant and it's way more effective! (you have to learn the skill first though)<br />3. Karma points: Do good deeds and get more karma (unlocks certain things but not really anything major)<br />4. Arena is kind of renamed and the concept has become more close to it's name compared to the one in Far Cry 3<br />5. Fortresses: Much more strongly guarded outposts but pretty much the same concept.<br />6. Outpost Master: Play the same outpost again in case you wanted to try a different technique<br />7. Many more decision paths in playing the missions: Adds some replay value<br /><br />Plus on top of that<br />-I think the Missions are slightly better.<br />-They have added more collectibles as well which is kind of annoying when you want a 100% game completion but helps a lot to get skill points and karma quicker.<br />-Slightly changed interface to syringes and auto crafting of health syringes<br /><br />A very good first person shooting game nonetheless for first time buyers. Probably one of the best I have played.	2015-08-14

US	50000557	R114ZL4M6HUGWU	B00LYYN5W6	245316869	Project CARS	Video Games	5	6	8	N	Y	TLDR: This is the most fun I've had playing a racing game.	First copy shipped from Amazon was an empty case, no disc.  It wasn't shrink wrapped, no sticker, nothing.  I suspect this one was a &#34;display case&#34; for people working in the warehouse and it got sent to me by accident, but it would be interesting to hear if this happened to anyone else.  I contacted Amazon, and they shipped a replacement with free 1 day delivery, so in the end I was satisfied.<br /><br />Unlike Gran Turismo and many other racing games, there's no &#34;grinding&#34; to unlock cars or mods, which makes the single player career mode refreshingly fun right from the start.  It features a number of racing disciplines, including karts, GT cars, touring cars, road cars, LMP prototypes, and a few open wheel variants similar to Formula 1, you can start your career where ever you like, however there are special achievements for starting at the beginning and working your way up.  Online multiplayer is a blast if you race with the right people, but can be frustrating when lower skilled drivers bump and ram, but that can happen in any public online racing games.  Online leaderboards/time trials are extremely poorly done, and in my opinion one of the biggest drawbacks of the game.  Best lap times are grouped by car class, so you can really only race one or two cars in any given class if you want to be competitive... and that also means you only get one entry per class at each track.  I can't set a fast lap in my favorite road car *AND* the fastest road car, so I have to pick which I'd rather have appear on the board.  Car selection is not that large compared to Gran Turismo, however there is enough variety in most classes that it doesn't matter too much, and all cars are unique in their handling so you won't feel like you have 20 different models of the same thing in your garage.  Some of the most popular car manufacturers are left out, particularly Japanese and Italian companies seem to have a very small representation.  Vehicles can't be modded, but canbe tuned... tweaking all sorts of settings including (just to name a few) tire pressures at each corner, brake balance and pressure, roll bar stiffness, suspension height and damping, and much more.  The cars also can't be painted custom colors, but they each have a few pre-made &#34;liveries&#34; to allow for some visual variety in races.  Physics are amazing, but extremely challenging when compared to some other racing games.  The graphics are spectacular, a night race in a thunderstorm on a remote poorly lit track is particularly breathtaking, and watching the sunrise near the end of a 24 hour Le Mans run is equally remarkable.  Some areas of the game are not done, and there are a few bugs that can be very frustrating.  Normally I would drop my rating for it, but in this case I've seen the game's development team being extremely active with the community in finding and resolving the bugs, so I am confident that this game will quickly be improving.<br /><br />To get the best experience, I would *HIGHLY* recommend playing this game with a steering wheel and pedals.  It brings the immersion to a whole new level.  Force feedback isn't the best by default, but it's extremely customizable, to a level I've never seen before.  The large number of FFB settings can seem daunting, but the community has an excellent collection of &#34;alternate&#34; feedback settings that really clean it up and make it easy to feel the road and the car reacting to it.  Unfortunately, entering these settings is unique per car (and even per track if you don't do it ahead of time from your garage), which can become a long and tedious process, but in the end is worth every minute spent dialing in the numbers.  I recommend starting with just a few cars settings while you figure out which &#34;set&#34; of FFB settings you like most.<br /><br />Overall, this is the most fun I've had playing a racing game, and I've played just about all of them.	2015-08-14

It's a real shame hardly anyone makes tactical shooters anymore. What happened to the genre? Don't get me wrong, I think Battlefield and Halo and Counterstrike and all those games are fine, but they lack a certain nuance when it comes to tactics. Sometimes you want to do more than run and gun. There's something to be said for stalking around corners and peeking under doors. I guess I'm an anachronism these days but I wish somebody would make a game like RS3 again. Still a fun game.	2015-08-14

I heard Far Cry 4 was coming out and I was excited. I finally got it and I had mixed feelings about it. I liked the new area and the new characters at first. Eventually it felt like I was choosing the lesser of two evils. In Far Cry 3, it was obvious who the bad guy was. So I didn't love the story. However the game play was improved over Far Cry 3. You can move bodies so your enemies don't suspect anything. You can put bait out for animals that you are hunting. Overall, this was a good game but the story needed to be better. I would still recommend this game to fans of the far cry series and new players.	2015-08-14

My Fiancee recently bought me this game and let me tell you. This game is freaking amazing! There are so many things you can do in this game and leveling up is not too slow and not to fast. It's just right. I, who comes from WoW and LoA can say this is one of the best games for MMO RPG. Only reason why bad kids are mad is because they cry about why consoles are so bad and they ended up paying a subscription fee before it came out for console gamers. I play both PC and Xbox One and I can say the adult pc gamers who claim console suck, are as annoying as the children who play console games.	2015-08-14

He's been wanting Skylanders but we already had an iPad and he just got a DS for his birthday so I didn't want to buy another gaming system like a Wii, Xbox, etc. I was excited to see this in the tablet version. He's able to play with the figurines at home and play some of the game on the go with the codes. He likes that he can buy the older Skylanders and they work too.<br /><br />Battery life on the portal is pretty good. It's about what I expected it to be. We went through 24 batteries in no time but he was playing it a lot over Christmas break and I bought the cheap batteries for low draining devices. I bought some better batteriers and they don't seem to drain as fast.<br /><br />I just hope that Activision doesn't come out with a new set year and focuses on Trap Team for another year or so. It would be disappointing if they did. I noticed that the store shelves are packed with Swap Force and Giants starter packs. Not sure why you'd buy either of those now because they won't play Trap Team. They're basically outdated unless you only want to be able to play the older Skylanders. Hopefully Activision will take note of this and not outdate itself too soon.	2015-08-14

This pad is no exception.  The pad features very spring-y buttons, responsive analog pads, and a good sized d-pad.<br /><br />On the subject of buttons however, the L and R triggers are in fact digital triggers, not analog.  This is not a deal breaker by any means, but it's something to keep in mind and it was worth a star to me.<br /><br />If you're considering buying one of these pads, it's probably for Super Smash Bros.  If that's the case I can assure you this is a fine pad for it.  I've been using it for some time, and have not had a single issue with it.  Serious competitive players though will tell you that you need a gamecube wired controller for Smash Bros, and I won't disagree.  There's always a feeling of confidence when you're on an official wired pad.<br /><br />That being said, if you're not in a tournament with a cash prize or your freedom on the line, this is a fine Pad to use for Super Smash Bros, or for playing Virtual Console games on your Wii or Wii U.  Just don't play SNES games with this pad, the gamecube button layout is not friendly to SNES games.  It's great for just about every other VC games though.	2015-08-14

My last Xbox controller charger I bought was an Energizer for my Xbox 360 and I never had a problem with it. This one however had a few kinks that needed to be worked out. The main problem being that even though the controller will stop charging when the device believed they are fully charged is wrong. When you turn on the Xbox they are slightly consumed according to the Xbox battery reader. Now this is no big deal since I'm not usually playing games for 8 hours straight and don't need that extra two hours to continue gaming. However, I could see this being a concern to many other people.<br /><br />Secondly I could installing the battery packs quite easy even though others found it difficult. The arros pointed me in the right direction and the + - was correct as well. They charge at a fast rate as well. All in all I would recommend this product to someone who doesn't want to pay a lot of money to charge their controllers, but if you have a few extra bucks I would recommend the Energizer, you will be much happier and can use rechargeable batteries instead.	2015-08-14

The joystick also seemed more sensitive than the originals - maybe that's just because the old ones I had were way overused and you had to slam the joystick to the side to get your characters moving.<br />However - I had no issues.  I tested all the buttons on all the remotes, everything works great.  I was also very happy with the colors that were sent - I ordered four unaware of what colors I would even receive, I assumed I'd probably get four of the same color. So I was pleasantly surprised to get a green, black, clear and blue remote.  Not to mention the price is pretty reasonable. Hoping they hold up, I will update the review if they do not.	2015-08-14

The only matches I sort of enjoyed were on maps like Free Fall, which are much smaller in size and therefore faster paced. But even then, the ease of killing someone (or being killed) because of the guns being so overpowered still doesn't satisfy. If you're spotted, you're basically dead. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />The maps are all in the same gray tone with not much color contrast, which makes it that much easier for campers. Everything blends into everything, and makes it not only frustrating to play, but boring to look at as well.	2015-08-14

The game disk and game case were in excellent almost new condition! Way better than I was expecting from the description. The only thing that bugs me is the stickers on the back, but that's only because I'm a little O.C.D. about that stuff lol beyond that I'm more than satisfied with the value of what I got to what I paid. Now on to the games themselves lol. As an avid Final Fantasy fan I have to say that it is nice to see where it all began. Game play is a little different than I am used to and I see why they changed it, however, the games are still enjoyable and I do recommend them to any FF fan or RPG fan if for no other reason than to own/play the classics.	2015-08-14

So far good graphics and I'm enjoying the game!<br />Sucked until I managed to make my way to the boss that finally gave me my first point of insight.<br />Being able to level up after that point helped. But it took a while to figure out.<br /><br />Sadly this game is requires a lot of grinding to be able to add 1 measly point to a skill. The requirements go up with each point earned.<br />Plus the weapons deteriorate with use, so having to repair weapons all the time while having to grind so much is not very fun.	2015-08-14

This game is great, and I am very happy that the series rebooted. Deception offers quick strategic game play that involves setting traps and killing baddies with a sick twist of humor. This version of the game includes the original campaign, a new campaign, and a bunch of goodies to mess around with. The PS4 version of the game has a MASSIVE graphic boost when compared to the PS3 verion. Furthermore, this version includes multiple things to tinker with, like the &#34;Deception Studio&#34;. This game is the complete Deception 4, and I would highly recommend picking it up.	2015-08-14

I was level 81.5 (the maximum) and had mastered every type of play. It was always fun, always kept me engaged, and had few boring moments. ESO takes SOOOO LONG to get anything done. there is no clear tutorial or explanation about how to do simple things like crafting or learn your fighting buttons. This is NOT an Elder Scrolls game, its a Warcraft game by Bethesda Soft.<br /><br />This game is dark. and I don't mean gritty or gory. I mean its pitch black in some interior spaces. Even with a 5 bar connection to the North American server the controls are lagging. Almost all of the items I picked up in the first few missions were worth ZERO at the vendors. Combat is lame. Push Buttons, swing sword. Power attack = Counter opening. Lame. All of the cool stuff costs &#34;crowns&#34; like any game nowadays with tons of dlc add ons. Bethesda has sold out and lets hope Fallout 4 is the comeback.<br /><br />What makes me mad the most is the lack of transferable account. When I upgraded from Xbox 360 to Xbox One I received COD Ghosts season pass FOR FREE ($42 value). When I logged into ESO with my old account from the launch PC version, I GOT NOTHING. I didnt get back my Imperial edition. Is it so hard for Bethesda to transfer this information over? Its not like Xbox and Microsoft's Games for Windows are from different companies.<br /><br />This is getting traded in tomorrow. Feel free to comment but nobody is changing my mind.	2015-08-14

US	20803067	R37JUE6DTV7Y43	B00KWFCV32	16819689	Splatoon	Video Games	4	0	0	N	N	Not without its problems but still a good game.	The gameplay is of this game is addicting and unique, the theme and style is awesome, it has really good graphics, a really good art style, and the game has been expanding over time with new weapons, maps, modes, and tweaks to existing content. The single player is fun and challenging and the Amiibo support, while not the best, feels worth it.<br /><br />The downside is there's a weapon imbalance that is especially noticeable at high level play. The game isn't super laggy but lag hurts the game badly at high level play due to no regional matchmaking. You can only group up with friends in ranked battles. Maps you play on are randomly selected from 2 maps that are changed every 4 hours. There's no voice chat. You can't see your teamates weapons until the battle starts. You can't choose new weapons during gameplay or between rounds (in turf war at least). The local multiplayer is not up to par either with only one on one battles, no campaign co-op, and no taking friends locally online.<br /><br />Ultimately though, while the downsides of Splatoon are definitely worth noting and they do hurt the game, they don't hurt the game enough to make the game not fun. The gameplay and style far outshines the areas it's lacking in. It's not the perfect game, but it's a great new IP and first attempt by Nintendo on a genre that's oversaturated.	2015-08-14

The ergonomics are perfect, the shoulder buttons drastically improve upon the inordinately stiff buttons of the original, the D-pad feels tight and responsive, and it's as plug-and-play as one would expect. And yet, here I am giving it a middling review because of a lack of quality control. Within two days of light to moderate use, the right trigger on my brand new controller developed a stickiness when releasing the trigger back to its neutral position. The left trigger did not exhibit this problem but it also didn't see nearly as much use as the right (I had been playing Burnout: Paradise). I realize I may have received a bum controller -- manufacturing defects happen, after all -- but my first brush with this controller has left a sour taste in my mouth; a far cry from my storied legacy with its nigh-indestructible 360 predecessor.   After reading some other negative reviews for this product (thumbstick rubber wearing out, connectivity problems with the 3.5mm port), I'm hesitant to give the controller a second chance. Here's hoping the next revision irons out these issues.	2015-08-14

I have the Limited Edition Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds 3DS XL so when I saw ANOTHER limited edition Legend of Zelda 3DS I knew I had to have it eventually. I really like the design, more so than the A Link Between Worlds 3DS XL. It only comes with a 4GB micro SDHC card but I was prepared. Before buying this 3DS, I had already bought a 64GB micro SDXC card and configured it to FAT32 since that's the only type of SD card the 3DS supports. I then transferred everything on my current A Link Between Worlds 3DS's SD card to the new 64GB SDXC card with the help of a SD card adapter. As soon as this new majora's mask 3DS arrived, I performed the system transfer and now I have a 64GB SDXC that will easily last for the lifecycle of this 3DS.<br /><br />You can instantly tell the 3D is a lot better on the new 3DS just from configuring it during the initial system setup! You can navigate through the main menu a lot smoother as well thanks to the increased processing power. I've only been playing Pokemon (ORAS) so far so I'm not sure how the little C-nub handles. I'd have to play a game that utilized it and get back on that.<br /><br />Anyways, if you're a Legend of Zelda fan or just a avid collector, you should definitely get this if you weren't already one of the lucky ones to get it at launch. The price will only go up from here so I HIGHLY recommend buying this soon if you're still indecisive at this point. You won't regret it months from now when the price is even higher,	2015-08-14

If you liked the original Borderlands, then the Handsome Collection will give you more than your money's worth.  You get the same great game play from the previous gen console, but you get it on your XBOX One.  The game play feels a bit smoother, and the loading times seem a bit shorter.  I'm actually surprised that it still takes a few seconds for some screens to fully render, but alas its not perfect! I would recommend this game to those who haven't yet tried the series on the pure entertainment factor of the story line and characters.	2015-08-14

Label was completely removed, I wasn't to worried about that because I can just get a new printed label. The game came with two different color halves.

Yes, I bought it twice because I had both consoles in different rooms and I love these classic games enough that I want them available in two different spots.<br /><br />That being said, this collection is the single biggest collection of Sega games on a single compilation, and to this day it's easily the best compilation ever released by any company on any console.<br /><br />There are 49 games total, if you include the second version of Altered Beast, and for the price you're paying, you'll easily get hundreds of hours of entertainment from this disc.  There isn't a single game on the disc that I dislike, but your own taste may vary.  Primarily, I play the Phantasy Star games on this disc, and they alone would be worth the price of the collection.  But there are other gems strewn across the whole collection.  Kid Khameleon, the Sonic Games, Alex Kidd, Streets of Rage, etc.<br /><br />I gave the collection 5 stars because of rounding.  I would have given it 98 of 100 on that scale.  The 2 lost points would be for 1) Where is Toejam and Earl?  and 2) We really wanted Sonic 3 + Knuckles in this set.<br /><br />That disclaimer aside, if you're a fan of classic Sega Games or good games in general, get this set, you won't regret it.	2015-08-14

When a developer tells you that their game is going to be an &#34;open world&#34; your first reaction might be &#34;Hey, that's great! Lots to do, worth my hard earned dollar.&#34; The reality however of an open world, after playing several games of this genre, is that the open world experience is only as good as the creators of it make it. Unfortunately Bioware opted to include an over abundance of go and fetch it quests that do not advance the storyline or gain the player any significant items, weapons or armor. By the middle of the game, I was able to craft armor and weapons that were much better that the ones I acquired by pursuing a long and tedious quest through insanely inaccessible terrain. After a certain point I just gave up on collecting shards, astariums, occularium et cetera. These &#34;quests&#34; felt more like chores and so much filler that Bioware inserted into the game to bulk up their open world experience.   Having said that, DAI has a lot to offer players including memorable characters, an interesting (but somewhat predictable) story, nice graphics and character creation options, great combat mechanics, new and in-depth skills, and the ability to make choices throughout the game that do truly affect events in the game. It is obvious that Bioware spent a lot of time making sure that the player is truly immersed into the culture and history of Thedas and it is a feature of any game that I enjoy and respect from the developers. A game well worth your precious time and money. I just hope that if there is another installment of this game that they focus more on content intricate to the story than on meaningless quests and acquisitions.  On a side note the Xbox One version of this game plays much better than the 360 version to the point of being an almost completely different experience.	2015-08-14

This was my first MMO game and it isn't for me.  Firstly, despite the fact that I bought the disk I had to finish downloading before I could play it - which took over one full day - was not a good start.  I like to adventure solo, not with hundreds of players running around all over the place.  Too many times I could just follow the stream of players in or out of a quest so it was too easy.  I found all the quests too simple and short for my tastes.  I played for a week, didn't enjoy any of it, and gave up on it.  I pray they will release Elder Scrolls 4 for PS4 since my PS3 died and the consoles are not downward compatible.	2015-08-14

The first wheel I purchased broke within the first month of casual usage (roughly 20-30 hours of use).  After looking around online, it seems to be pretty common for this model to fail quickly.  Expecting no issues with support since this was common, I contacted Thrustmaster directly to try to get it fixed, but they were of no help whatsoever.  It took them over a week to reply to my support ticket, and once they did, they refused to offer any sort of support unless I connected the wheel to a windows PC for troubleshooting (which I could not).  They even continued to refuse support after I provided the company with multiple videos that clearly highlighted 3 major failures with the wheel, one of which had rendered it completely useless.<br /><br />If this item is sold as a ps4 accessory Thrustmaster needs to support it as a ps4 accessory!<br /><br />Luckily Amazon came to my rescue.  Even tho I was past the exchange period with Amazon, I explained to their support staff that the wheel had failed within that period, and I had tried to get support directly from the manufacturer but they refused.  Amazon took it back, no further questions asked, they didn't even ask to see the videos of it failing!  They sent me a replacement wheel of the same model.  So far it hasn't failed... and I'll keep my fingers crossed that it lasts.<br /><br />The replacement wheel works great so far, the force feedback is smoother and stronger than my old Logitech G25, it's also a little quieter because it doesn't have the gear chatter that the logitech wheels have.  However, the wheel has a cooling fan that turns on after a certain amount of use.  This fan isn't overly loud, but it's definitely noticeable.  In my opinion the fan noise is a little more annoying than the logitech gear chatter, but with the volume up an extra notch it's easy to forget.  If the wheel gets too hot from continued use at high feedback settings, the feedback will cut out completely until it cools.  The company says this is to protect the motors from damage, but I think it's a function of poor design.  My Logitech wheel would last for 12+ hour endurance races at it's highest feedback setting without an issue, and lasted me 5+ years in that fashion.<br /><br />The stock pedals are horrible, and serious racers will want to upgrade them immediately.  There's no clutch pedal, and the brake has a very springy feel that doesn't feel natural, and makes it difficult to consistently apply partial pressure when braking.  The Thrustmaster T3PA Pro pedals are a good replacement set to pair with this wheel, offering a much better brake feel and a clutch pedal.<br /><br />Overall, it's good when it works.  Hopefully it works.  Inexcusable lack of support from Thrustmaster.  Would seriously consider going back to Logitech with their new g29 if I had to make the purchase again.	2015-08-14

All you have to do is get the driver for it (which can be found on the Dolphin wiki through google), set it to WiiU mode, and then click &#34;Direct Connect&#34; in the controller menu. After this, it works perfectly. You don't even have to set up the buttons, calibrate the stick, or adjust deadzones. It just works like the real thing. Easily worth your time if you want to play Dolphin with an authentic controller. As a tournament player of Super Smash Brothers Melee and a fan of F-Zero GX, both games which require extremely fine and correct inputs, I can say that these work great. I can SHFFL and Wavedash in Melee just like the console, and I can control the finicky machines of F-Zero GX just like the console. Simply amazing!	2015-08-14

Badass headphones with nice versatility.<br /><br />First off the sound from these is better than expected.  Nice deep bass and acceptable high range.  The inclusion of multiple connectors is a welcome addition too.  The base phones use a 4-part miniplug like a pair of phone headphones.  This can be plugged into the xbox adaptor to get sound through your controller (the xbox doesn't shut off the tv sound automatically when you do this which is dumb) or straight into your smartphone to listen to music or make calls.  Included is also a splitter that turns them into the more common for computers seperate mic and speaker cables.<br /><br />The cord is LONG.  For a set of phones that're sold for use with a controller it's a bit too long.  This makes me suspicious these were designed for someone to use elsewhere and repurposed.  The ear covers are big-ish and give pretty good isolation.  The headband adjustment is automatic and works quite well to keep hard bits off of your head.  My only complaint is it squeezes a little on my big (XXL helmet) noggin.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the microphone mute on the phones themselves which is behind the let ear -- not a natural location.  If you're using the Xbox connector this is a non-issue.  The mic is serviceable but well hidden.	2015-08-14

The graphics are well beyond its time considering this is for Playstation 2. The gameplay is excellent, but I will dive into some downsides.... There is no damage to vehicles, the computer gameplay is predictable (they follow a race pattern every time), there is no headlights for the vehicles, and compared to GT2, this game lacks car inventory. I still think that this game paved the way for future racing games, hence I would highly recommend!	2015-08-14

I've had a ModdedZone controller for over a year and a half. I love it!  Of course it works the best on Call of Duty because of the way the game has been developed. I've used it on Destiny also. Rapid fire works but not as good as it does on CoD. But that is because of the way Destiny was developed. I have a friend that has had 2. One for PS3 and one for PS4 (which the PS4 controller will work on PS3 also). He loves his. I'm actually considering buying a new controller from Modded zone just to have a different color. The only problem I have had is that I bought the candy blue one. The paint has rubbed off slightly because of the continued use. Which is going to happen. That's why I still gave it 5 stars.	2015-08-14

Best of the series	I'm a pretty big fan of this series, and strategy games in general, I got both of ones on 360 the day they came out and enjoyed them for quite some time, I still play Cold War on Xbox one, and war chest is personally my favorite of the bunch. I didn't think I would enjoy it as much from the gameplay I saw of unicorns and fairies as enemies but they do add a different feel to the game, along with the normal military themed enemies. There's a lot more content in this one, you can buy/unlock a bunch of upgrades for your heroes and defensive weapons which is a nice touch. There's 8 armies in the game(I only have 4 since I bought the digital copy for $15), all of their defenses are different which is pretty cool, each one plays pretty differently so that adds to the replay value. The campaign maps are all really cool, you go from d-day style maps to fighting in a strawberry princess type of maps, very varied. There's also online coop and verses mode, verses mode I don't like but coop is quite fun.<br />Will say I have experienced extreme frame drop lags when the action gets going a few times,mostly when you're playing as the hero.<br />But overall for the price, $30 for 8 armies, $15 for 4 it's a pretty good steal and with the amount of content it should keep you entertained for a while,	2015-08-14

Our youngest is 5 years old and the older one is almost 8, the hubby and I are in our 30's.<br />Fairly good graphics, decent background music, and it's pretty cool that they incorporate your Mii character as your player. The standard and remix versions of Clue and Life are very fun and easy enough for the entire family. The one thing about Clue is you have to trust that no one is peeking when you make a guess. Twister is definitely a memory work out for us older folks, and it's a bit tricky for the 5 year old. Mouse Trap is a favorite for the little ones. We haven't tried out the Yahtzee Hands Down yet. All in all a good family game.	2015-08-14

Mostly got it for the unique idea of it and many indie game developers on it.  I will say that the controller on day one wasn't that great and felt stiff.  Lucky you could use a ps3 dual shock controller and it worked like a charm.  Some games however have stopped being all free to play as developers I believe needed to make some income.  But still it is an amazing piece of hardware.	2015-08-14

My main issue with it is it isn't durable at all. If you are looking for a headset to last you a while this is no the one. My left ear cup broke off and the sound stops playing after about 10 minutes of use and I have to reset it.<br /><br />Note this is about 8 months after I bought it so it does last a while and plays sound fairly well in that time.	2015-08-14
