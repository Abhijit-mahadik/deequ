Although they were not able to take the place of trainers when used for more active events, they did offer more than shoes do in the lightweight and flexibility department and if you want something different then these do offer someone different.<br /><br />Verdict: 4.5/5	2015-08-08

It is the first Fossil item I have ever owned, but it looks like a really high quality item.  Typical Fossil quality?  I can not comment, but this is a great leather bag.<br /><br />I own a few laptops and tablets, and this bag will carry any of them, in fact several at once.  It has multiple pockets to carry laptops, notebooks, pens, business cards - you name it.  The leather is top notch as well as the construction.  Zippers are heavy duty and the magnetic clasp for the center pocket is well made and strong.<br /><br />And then there is the weight.  For a leather bag it is a nice, light weight. My laptops all came with bags and all of them are the nylon fabric bags.  This one is more practical, lighter weight and higher quality.<br /><br />Expensive?  Maybe, but for the road warrior it is a no brainer.	2015-08-08

These slippers were for my Dad who is 97 and his feet swell.  I have tried so many different kinds of slippers that just wouldn't fit.  These Propet slippers have great Velcro strength and they are easy for us to put on him.  We can easily adjust the flap according to amount of swelling.  He wears them all the time and they are well made, look great, and give him the support he needs.  So happy to have found a slipper that meets our needs.	2015-08-08

Based on most sizing guides I should have a size 43, which my last pair were, however those quickly became too loose even with the straps tightened all the way. This pair fit fine once I spent a few hours and miles with them. Right out of the box this pair fit slightly underneath my toes when standing but they are now very comfortable. I only have the straps tightened midway. I have wide feet, normally size 10 EEEE (4E) in US sizing when I can find it, and the M width of these Birkenstocks is perfect.<br /><br />The cocoa nubuck is slightly darker in person and doesn't look as roughly textured (it feels very smooth and soft). My previous pair of Arizonas lasted several years, including climbing a couple of short mountains. After a few weeks with this pair I expect a similar lifespan.	2015-08-08

By the time I got back I had cuts on my feet. This is due to the buckle closest to your ankle is on an elastic. So every time you walk the elastic stretches and keeps rubbing on your foot until you have an open cut. I tried sewing it down so it did not move, but that was then uncomfortable to walk in them. Every time I have worn them I ended up with cuts. Cute...but painful ;)	2015-08-08

I've purchase many pairs of Olukai sandals over the past few years.  They are the only sandal I wear and usually spend about 5 months a year wearing nothing but sandals. I've also recommend this brand of sandal to friends. Unfortunately I must report that I believe that as Olukai as a company got bigger and more well known, they started using different products / materials to produce their product.  This is the 2nd pair now where the sole is delaminating. This particular pair I have only worn less than a month.  I did return a pair a few years ago for similar reason. The customer support at Olukai replaced that pair, but kind of a hassle since you have to box them up and send them back to Hawaii.  I hope that Olukai will pay attention to the reviews their customers are making about the craftsmanship of their product and go back to constructing them the way they used to.	2015-08-08

I like the boot OK, on the comfort side my Red Wings are better on the price side these are better, we will just see on the longevity side. I guess I'd recommend them so far, NOT the best for comfort,  but surely NOT the worst.....	2015-08-08

This is my third pair of Softwalks in three years -- not because they wore out, but because I love them. I also snag a pair whenever I see my size on sale. This last one is &#34;red&#34;, although it's a little more orange than the photo shows. In any case, I love the color, as it goes with so many of my summer clothes. Also, I have a narrow foot and somewhat of a high arch. These shoes fit perfectly and wear well. Other than a pair of Mephistos, these are my &#34;go to&#34; sandals, and they are less expensive.

I was tired of those huge women's glasses that always mess up my makeup (because it sits on my cheeks). These fit great for me. I love the casual look of these glasses, the durability, and the sun protection. The polarization really makes things look sharp and clear when I'm driving. This was definitely a great buy but perhaps just for Asian faces.	2015-08-08

Toe is wider than I'd like, but what more can I say?  We're at their mercy.  I've asked them to use the old W or L if they can't/won't standardize, (esp. since not many outlets carry their shoes, so it's mainly mail order) but their answer was: many retailers don't want all the sizes.

This wallet had plenty of room for my case, change, credit cards and misc. items that normally would take several different devices to hold.  I do not use it for my checkbook but that's only because it's not what I needed it for.  It's easy to get stuff in and out.....both cash/coins and credit cards.  I'm very happy with this wallet and I think it's going to last for quite awhile.  It's nice thick leather.  I was worried the zipper would be cheap and would catch easily but it's been working fine and I have no complaints about it.	2015-08-08

I like the style, the neutral color goes with almost anything.  I must admit, as a guy with no sense of style, my wife picked these out and as always she has great taste.  They look great and are a great alternative if, like me, you get tired of wearing flip-flops all the time.<br /><br />I would also consider purchasing some liner socks to wear with these.	2015-08-08

They come in a nice fabric bag, and in a box, with a thank you note inside! These glasses are presented very well! Much better than most glasses I have ever bought! I have strange tendencies with sunglasses myself. I like to spend little for low quality product, and in this sense I think these glasses cost too much if you pay full price for them. I also like to pay a lot if the sunglasses are worth it. At one time I bought a Chanel pair of sunglasses a few years ago, and it was totally worth it, I am still wearing them even though they are probably still counterfeit - I bought them on ebay. Anyway, these glasses do seem cheap. That is the glasses themselves. The shades have some sort of a tint, like green tint, so sometimes when you are looking at something it will appear green! I also feel that they seem sort of cheap when I put them on. Just in terms of the plastic, how it feels on your face, not the style of it. The look of the glasses overall though, from a distance is decent. I have bought numerous glasses like these over my lifetime. They fit well on my ears and nose, even though I bought them online and did not try before buying. They look fancy, good, stylish, you name it. I am not sure how long they will last, I will update. So far, I just got them. So, in the end, I have had sunglasses like these before, they usually last 1 season, or 2 maximum. They will work, and look good, but you cannot expect them to be any more than that. I have received these sunglasses at a discount for a review.	2015-08-08

First off I want to say that the shoes I received were not the same ones pictured. Second the size of the shoes appeared to be rather large. I ordered for 1 year old which should be a size 3 in U.S. But I think the size of these are closer to a U.S. Size 5 anyway was not impressed the the construction of the shoes and the ill fitting. I wouldn't recommend the purchase of these shoes	2015-08-08

The cut of the top is more interesting than I anticipated. For those who have the option of wearing open-toed shoes in the workplace, these fit a special niche of being appropriate with many lengths and items.<br /><br />Cons: As has been said before, the shoe is wider than needed; visually, I get the sense that my foot expanded. The metallic buckle came out of the box looking scuffed and cheap. I'm worried that I'll need to replace just the buckles, which would be irritating and undermine the price. I wish the brand made half sizes; I would have dropped to a 10.5 if it were available.	2015-08-08

I want to comment on all of the points asked about his product....First, they are a perfect size six. I'm a 6 to 6.5, and these JUST fit toe to heel. Second, I have worn them all day, but I have NOT walked all day in them. Third, These are narrow, but YAYYY...cuz I have a narrow foot! So, these are PERFECT as far as width. Last, there is a tiny bit of support for the arch, but not much. I do have a high arch, but I find them comfortable to wear.	2015-08-08

I knew I would do a lot of walking on shore and even on the ship. I loved the color. They seemed really comfortable and I broke them in a bit at home before I left. I was sad on the cruise when I got some blisters from the strap! I clearly did not break them in well enough. The other bummer is that the design on the bottom (you can see its like a white flower) Started to peel off while on the trip. I don't know if it was the heat, them setting in the sun while i was in the pool or ocean, sweaty feat, or what! But I was a little bummed out that happened. It doesn't affect the function of the shoe at all or even the overall look of the sandal while it is on your feet. So all in all it doesn't matter too much, but still. that happened!<br /><br />Tip: Make sure you really break them in before a trip!<br /><br />I give 4 stars because I feel the original price is a bit on the higher side.	2015-08-08

I needed a sturdy shoe for the beach that I could wear with my ankle brace due to a broken foot. These fit the bill perfectly.

I purchased this bag over a year ago from another outlet, and have not been one bit disappointed.  This is a very good quality handbag.  The material is nice and thick-inside and out, it is quilted and very well sewn.  She makes the interior of her bags really stand out too.  The exterior pockets are nice and roomy, and I appreciate lots of room in my purses.  There is a zippered compartment that runs along the whole backside which is very convenient, and one on the inside.  Have several leather bags which can be heavy once everything is in them.  Decided to try the Donna Sharp handbag line because the quality was so good and it's made in America, and am very happy with it.  I now own 3 of these same style bags for the different seasons.  If you like bigger handbags, don't hesitate to give this bag a try.	2015-08-08

When I received this and tried them on, I knew immediately they were too small.  My toe was very snug, too much for break in to take care of.  I returned and got a size 12 and they fit perfectly as far as length goes.  The toe box on this shoe is much wider than I expected.  While I like a wide toe box, some folks may not.  I wear these to road run in (Salomon Speedcross for trails).  I comfortably ran a half marathon in them with only about 20 miles of break in.  As of this writing, I have about 100 miles on them and there is little to no sign of wear.  They seem to be very durable.  Nice cushioning in the heel and good arch support.  By the way, I'm 6'2, 216 pounds.  Only gave 4 stars due to the size discrepancy.  Aside from that, awesome shoes.	2015-08-08

The shoes were too short, and the toes too narrow. I also noticed that the arch was in the center of my foot...NEXT to the arch, not even in the correct location. I was very disappointed. It seems that Born has gone down in quality the last few years. The fabric they use to line the shoe seemed cheap and lacking in quality. Too bad, because Born gas been good for walking and standing, I guess I will have to start looking for another brand.	2015-08-08

They're made of synthetic leather, but you'd be hard pressed to know that from the color and the &#34;grain&#34; which give these the look of much more expensive shoes. I'm very pleased with their appearance, the ease of getting in and out of them, the fit, and the quality of workmanship.<br /><br />The shoe color matches the color shown on the Amazon description page very well, and the fit is true to both size and the width I ordered. The insides are lined in a soft suede-like material all the way down to the insoles which are cushioned and provide a good arch support. The 2 1/2&#34; heel is slightly higher than the average kitten heel, but makes the shoe look darling and places my foot at an angle I can feel comfortable with while wearing the shoes.<br /><br />The manufacturer even included a spare set of heel tips so I can replace the originals when they get worn down, and that's a nice touch I don't often see even when buying far more expensive shoes. The soles are manmade, have non-slip ridges, and appear to be glued on as I see no visible stitching. I tested their ability to withstand stress by bending the shoe several times and all the seams held true without any bulges or gaps, so they seem durable.  I did not see any flaws in the quality or craftsmanship of these shoes, and they look beautiful and feel comfortable.  I like them a lot and think they're well made and adorable. 5 Stars<br /><br />Promotional discount received for evaluation and review purposes.	2015-08-08

The almond shaped toe is very stylish and not too pointy yet pointed enough to have an updated look. The suede is very matte, short grain suede that Aquatalia has mastered for use in inclement weather.<br /><br />There is an interior side zip so they are far easier to get on than annoying pull on boots. I have an average calf and they fit great. I love the OTK style, and this one is well done and the suede makes it understated enough for work. I normally wear size 8.5.

I have worn them for several rides and like the feel. Not too heavy. The zippers work smoothly, but I always lube them before first use and on occasion as a precaution. At a price of only $75, I feel they are an excellent value as I saw the same boot at HD dealership for almost $200.  Very pleased so far.	2015-08-08

The first one was stolen or I lost it after a year or so and had bought my first Lahaina model then. Used it for more than 10 years at least, could not remember if more. Poor thing suffered every torture imaginable, getting into a washing machine to sitting on it multiple times and bending the frame here and there. It was not a problem putting the frame back in shape, except when a truck ran over it ! Had to order a replacement for one of the glasses and was difficult to put the frame back in some reasonable shape but I still used it for a while.<br /><br />I then bought a Honolua Bay model last year but recently had a problem with the bridge on that one. It will be fixed under the warranty but having read the other reviews as well, I do not recommend that model as it looks like some of titanium models seems to be failure prone.<br /><br />I had not realized that Lahaina model was still available and having found one in Amazon ordered one immediately and I am so happy now :)	2015-08-08

The inner is sewn into the sole of the shoe so you can wear them barefoot as I often do and you wont have the inner come out / separate through sweat / rubbing. I really like that aspect and it makes them a great choice just for an around the traps.<br /><br /> The corduroy feels great and the heel has a slight gel type padding that is great to walk on combined with the sole which has a bit of a spring to it. The color scheme of these is another aspect of the design (not as out there as the yellow pair I also have)<br /><br /> I just popped them on and they fit perfectly with no slipping or issues with the heel giving me blisters. I thought maybe I would go a size bigger if I wore socks but I tried these with socks today as well and they were still very comfortable so I think the US sizing is good although I'd prob go just half a size up.<br /><br /> Really unique and I can highly recommend them as a really nice, inexpensive casual shoe.<br /><br /> Product provided for review - its just my opinion.	2015-08-08

Not only do these sandals have minimal arch support, they absolutely tore my feet up. The straps might as well be made out of sandpaper. They made cuts all over my feet after a few minutes casually walking in my neighborhood. I couldn't even make it home, I had to stop in a bookstore and buy a pair of flip flops just to get home. I was ready to go barefoot in the street if this wasn't an option. I couldn't recommend these shoes less. A month later I still have scars on my feet.	2015-08-08

Prior to the trip, they fit about the same as the ones I recently purchased - a bit tight across the top of the foot and a bit narrow (not much toe wiggle room for me). I broke them in a little by wearing them about 2 hrs. each day for 5 days or so. When we left for Italy, they still felt a bit tight -- but I never experienced any blistering.<br />Once we arrived in Italy, I wore them most every day, especially the ones that would involve a lot of walking. I never had a problem with them.<br />So, I am expecting the same performance with these -- they need to be broken in, but once they are, there will be no regrets!	2015-08-08

PURCHASED:<br />Noble Mount Crinkle Nylon 'Explorer' Crossbody Handbag - Dark Blue<br />Sold by: NVie Designs<br /><br />I was really excited to find this bag for all its pockets and the fact that they had lining. It seemed to be a real quality bag with multiple uses and for with almost every outfit/occasion.<br />I began having issues with one of the three larger pocket zippers not easily zipping very far shut. I would have to carefully press the teeth down and just as carefully--the zippers are plastic--move the handle bit forward and slowly zip it shut.<br />The other day I decided to use the inside center pocket zipper for my billfold for the first time since purchasing the bag.<br />The next day I went to retrieve my billfold and noticed the zipper was open. I thought someone else must have opened it, but when I looked closer I noticed the very fine and tiny zipper had split!<br />I slowly zipped it shut, or more so tried to, and it stayed split no matter how the handle part moved. Broken after ONE use.<br />***Would not recommend.<br />UPDATE: I've been using this bag almost daily since I received it the first part of May 2015. The plastic zippers are a nightmare. I have to carefully unzip and then ever so delicately attempt to zip back shut the section. Just now I spent more than a few minutes trying to press in the plastic teeth to allow the zipper to move, to no avail. I tried so many different ways and FINALLY succeeded in getting the zipper to shut.<br />DO<br />NOT<br />BUY!	2015-08-08

My headphones	I'm a grad student & I really adore this backpack. There's so many pockets, and the little pocket for small items on top is the best. My headphones, aquaphor, eyedrops and little things go in there and it's very easy to access. The quality of the material is great, easy to clean, and the zippers are nice too. There's two pockets within the bigger section of the backpack, one for laptop & another one that reminds me of an expanding folder. I can keep all my chargers in the &#34;expanding folder&#34; and they don't float around the bottom of the bag. My sister likes her Herschel better, citing the fact that Kipling's straps are more narrow so she finds them less comfortable. I'm petite so I don't find a problem with the straps, and it never feels heavy on my back.<br /><br />Just for an idea of how much the backpack can hold, altogether I normally can fit the following into my backpack: Yearly Plumpaper planner, mini whiteboard, 1.5&#34; & 1&#34; Discbound notebooks, Laptop, PS Vita charger, laptop charger, cardigan, two pencil bags, small make-up bag, bag of GinGins, wallet, external charger & cable, gum/mints, granola bars or mini tupperwares of snacks, & a 20 oz Blender Bottle.	2015-08-08

While they could use a little more arch support, they are comfortable shoes. Sometimes my left big toe hits the inside of the shoe, but as I'm wearing them more, it is hitting less.

They must be one of the best ones I've ever had for years. I'm always out there hunting for comfortable walking/hiking-style shoes, but I was always being following TNF, Columbia or Timberland. The last pair I bought from TNF sucks, so I decided to change a flavor a try out Merrell. It turns out to be a brilliant idea! It does have perfect arch support, and adequate enough room for toes to move but not too huge to allow my feet to budge too much within it. It's great!<br /><br />So I bought another pair of different color from Amazon a week later and got it today. It feels as good as this pair! I have to give Merrell credit for this model - I think I found my dream shoes now.	2015-08-08

I initially got these for me, but my significant other picked them up and decided they were his. He's pretty picky about his sunglasses and usually forks out big bucks for bulky other brands, but we're both really fans of these. The lack of rims is very trendy and makes any face looks sleek. I love the bag it comes in and how easily they are cleaned. These glasses have very well constructed hinges and even if you have a chubbier face, they don't feel like they're squeezing your brains out. These are a definite yes and I guess I need to order a different pair for me. The coloring of the shades is nice and soothing and cuts back on the summer sun glare. These were perfect on a hike, on a drive and even pulling into work. They look trendy and professional and I think man or woman these are wonderful shades.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.	2015-08-08

US	31457913	RHMOEDNOZ0YIX	B00277T6RC	79902270	Goodhope Panther Microfiber Organizer Messenger Bag	Shoes	5	0	0	N	Y	Owned this purse/bag since 2012 and use it everyday!	First of all, I like it very much.  I've owned it since 2012. I am NOT a purse &#34;changer&#34; accept for very dressy occasions so, it is my primary bag and has been used every day. It is finally starting to show a tiny amount of wear at the bottom corners but, I can't seem to find another bag/purse that I like better. Here are my PROS and CONS:<br />PROS:<br />1) Comfortable, adjustable one strap.  Wear it shoulder style or cross-body.<br />2) Interior is bright pink material so I can see everything in it.<br />3) Interior has a wide enough slot on one slot to keep a wallet, with card slots on the front of that. Opposite side has a wide, zippered enclosure and above it, a slot for a pen. Attached to the front of that same zippered pocket is a Velcro closure pocket and next to that pocket a clear vinyl pocket.<br />The middle of the purse/bag is divided by a zippered enclosure.<br />4) The exterior is made of a VERY durable material.  One side has a full-across zippered pocket.  The other side has a three-quarter-across zippered pocket and next to it, (the remaining 1/4 quarter) holds a pocket with a Velcro flap closure.<br />5) All zippers are strong and have held up very well.<br />6) It is not so deep that you have to &#34;dig&#34; to the bottom to find anything.<br />7) It is sturdy on it's own. Not floppy.<br />CONS:  (Note... These are only &#34;CONS&#34; for my personal use and taste.)<br />1) The center divider pocket inside is loose/floating.  I would prefer it was attached to the bottom so that small things couldn't slide under it.<br />2) I'm one of those people who carries everything everyone else expects me to have... band aids, Tums, mints, gum, relatives' house keys, tissue, an actual camera, etc. Sooo... I would like it to be a little wider in both directions but, not any higher.  I like seeing everything and not having to dig under or to the bottom of a purse/bag.<br />3) The exterior pocket with the Velcro flap cover will I'm certain, NOT fit a smart phone.  I'm one of those hangers-on who has a Flip-phone that slides in there very nicely.  One super-sized Smart Phone in our family is enough so I have not as yet, succumbed.  It would be nice to have that outside pocket larger enough to accommodate one.<br />In conclusion, for me the PROS far outweigh the CONS.  I am toying with buying a new one.  I was hoping they'd make this one a bit bigger but, as of today, 8//2015 don't see that they have.<br />By the way... the questions asked for people to review this purse/bag are not for this item.  They are for SHOES!  Someone needs to correct that.	2015-08-08

US	52829466	RNDF265WFVY20	B00E0G5IA2	929926140	KEEN Women's Naples Sandal	Shoes	3	0	0	N	N	The Leather Straps are Too Big	I really expected to love these shoes, based on the reviews, and based on my satisfaction with my Keen H2 sandals.  Alas, the leather part is way too roomy for my foot.  I wear a solid 8.5 Med., leaning a little towards the wide side, but not wide enough for wide width shoes.  I LOVE the footbed of these sandals -- it is a perfect fit for my foot, and very comfortable.  A few reviews have complained that it's too hard, but I didn't find it to be so; it is leather over cork, and the cork has some give, so there is enough cushioning.  Mind you, they're not super cushy like some Tevas or other sandals can be.  The feel is similar to a Birkenstock, in my opinion.<br /><br />The problem for me is the leather straps that go over the top of the foot are way too roomy, and so when walking it feels like my foot is in danger of sliding off the foot bed.  They don't hold the foot in securely.  You can adjust the ankle strap, and that helps, but the upper part of the foot still slides around.  Unfortunately, I was so in love with the foot beds that when I got the shoes and just walked around the house, I talked myself into believing they were OK.  As soon as I walked outside for any distance, I realized they were a problem, and now it's too late to return them.  Sigh.  I googled &#34;how to shrink leather,&#34; and I may try some of those remedies (basically, wetting the leather and letting it dry) but since they're supposed to be waterproof, I don't know if that will help.  I doubt that an 8 would work for me, given the footbed is a great fit, but it might have worked better.  On the basis of my experience, I would recommend sizing down or ordering two sizes to compare, unless you have a particularly wide or high foot.	2015-08-08

First off they were difficult to put on because there are no laces. They felt comfortable and fit nice. Once on and worn for a 3 mile walk, I had blisters on my heels, on the inside and outside of my small toes. Ouch! I still wanted to like them, so I thought maybe I needed to break them in. I wore them on a hike to Lake Superior because of the sandy-rocky shore. Again my heel bleed from rubbing. In the water, sand passed into my shoe so I had a sand dune of wet sand to rinse out when I had to hike back. No way would another size work because the shoes were already difficult to put on. I would never recommend a friend to buy these! Painful, useless but pretty!	2015-08-08

I've always shied away from fitflops due to their cost and ordered these due to the reduced cost, Amazon has the best prices I could find for these sandals. I'm writing this review to address the sizing issue. I always buy size 8 for sandals and dress shoes and 8.5 for athletic shoes and boots which I wear medium to heavy socks with them. I was confused with all the reviews saying to size down a half or a whole size, I'm glad I didn't do that and ordered size 8, as I always do with sandals, and they fit like a glove I have many different brands of sandals from Tevas to the new Sanuks and size 8 always fits perfectly. My advice is order the size you normally wear in sandals or dress shoes, not the size you wear in athletic shoes. If you're a half size I'm not sure if you should go up or down in size, might be a good idea to go to a store and see what works for you, my left foot is closer to a 7.5 and the 8 fits fine. I haven't worn these outside yet, but they feel very comfortable and are very attractive on the foot.	2015-08-08

My last pair was wearing out and the store where I had bought them had closed, so I was excited to see the same shoe available online. However, these shoes are way smaller than the pair I have, though they're the  same design and same size. The only difference between the two pairs is the inner sole (if that's what it's called; the part of the shoe the bottom of your foot rests on). In the original pair, that part is the same soft leather as the rest of the shoe. In this pair, it's suede-like (which I doubt would hold up well). There's such a difference in sizing -- the online pair is much narrower than my original pair -- that I wonder if these are a knock-off. I'm giving them three stars only because I like the design. If I was rating the sizing, they'd get  one.<br /><br />So much for buying shoes online. They're going back.	2015-08-08

I had to return them and opted for another Salomon style, but it seems that all of the brand's shoes have the same sizing issue.  I ordered a size 6, which is my go-to size.  The heel and mid-foot area fit fine, but they felt very loose in the toe box.  Upon closer examination of the size tag on the shoebox, Salomon's US size 6 corresponds to an EU 37.5.  Most other shoe brands I've tried translate a 6 to an EU 36.  Hope this comparison helps other potential buyers!	2015-08-08

Its nice to know a brand is so well that you can be sure of what size to buy. That has always been my experience with ladies Nike shoes. So I am completely surprised when they arrived today and are HUGELY too big. Immediately I thought they must be mens based on the way they fit me. BUT the box says womens and the website says womens and they are pink. Hmmmmmm I don't get it. Now I have to deal with exchanging. They are allot more cute in person. Just wish they fit.	2015-08-08

These shoes were great. I normally wear a 8 1/2 in shoes so I wanted a 9 for hiking after I read the reviews. I ended up getting the 8.5 because it was the only size they had and I really liked the description and reviews. The shoes worked sooo well for me. I did not get a chance to break them in much but I wore them around the house for a couple hours about out twice. For the first day of the backpacking trip we hiked 8 miles and on the second day we went 14.8 miles. The shoes worked perfectly. I had minor pains from all of the hiking but my feet were fine and I had no problem keeping these shoes on longer.	2015-08-08

My order arrived late and you used no more than a 1gram plastic envelope for shipping thus offering ZERO protection.   On to the actual Shoes.. they are cute HOWEVER I did not receive the correct color, the black and silver turned out to be a black and gold which is ok but NOT what I ordered and paid for.   Secondly the shoes will need to be broken in unless you have very narrow feet, I wear a 8 1/2 in Nine West shoes and could barely get the shoes on the first time I tried so I figured I could brake them in while driving.   Finally, pay close attention to the actual platform part of the shoe, it does not cover all the way to the peep toe (which btw wont be a peep toe until worn a few times). Instead of being rounded off for a comfortable gate you will be walking on something about half a size smaller, so if you have BALANCE issues this may not be for you.	2015-08-08

Because of the higher heel, it is very important that your foot be a whole size so that it properly fills up the shoe from front to back.  I wear a size 7.5 so I had to order a size 8.  Since my heel does not reach the back properly, it doesn't cradle into the heel cup, which forces my foot forward.  The whole shoe is very uncomfortable because I am really a half size too small for it.  I should have returned them.

The style is just funky enough to be different from the people's around you, but simple enough to not raise much attention.  They are incredibly light and fairly comfortable for all day wear. And as described, they are a solid driving shoe - rounded heel, narrow toe and flexible sole make for articulate tap dancing on the clutch, brake and gas pedals.  Size matters!  At least with the pair I got.  I always buy the same size of Puma and every pair I've had has been just right.  These, however, are just a bit too small.  Not too small to wear comfortably, or to worry about a return, but smaller than I would like. If you're on the big side of your normal size, definitely consider going a half size larger.	2015-08-08

Just walk around in it and did some  jog for a short distance.  Initial assessment is that I am going to like it better than the Instinct 3 and Provision 2.

Love these shoes...This is the third pair of Cobian Foam Flip Flops I have ordered! I wear a 9 Narrow and these run on the narrow side so i was thrilled to find a pair of flip-flops that actually fit! (If you have narrow feet you understand how hard it is to find summer sandals and flip-flops)! I wore out the two pair i had last summer so decided to order another pair this year and love the new colors offered. I keep one pair for indoors to wear on our hardwood floors and one pair for everywhere else. The foamy footbed is super comfy. They will feel snug when you initially wear them but the foam bed will compress over time as they conform to your feet.<br />I am disappointed to see the brown color is already sold out! Nonetheless they are awesome flip-flops and I hope they keep making this style.	2015-08-08

Black and Gold Aviators	Great sunglasses, it's $10 for great quality honestly. It comes with a microfiber sack. When I received it the nose padding things were popping out and I thought I got the wrong size but I just popped them back to where they actually go and boom, they were perfect. I've bought a lot of Aviators from Amazon and these are probably one of the best. Better then some that have cost $20. The price is great as well. The size says says the lens is 51 mm, but I compared them to my other pairs and I find them to be 57mm or 58mm size. I have been looking for black and gold aviators for AGES and at a decent price. This is what I got and I'm happy with it. As soon as you put them on, you feel your badassery levels rise, like you're a guy who doesn't look at explosions. I contacted the company about how they didn't fit (Me like an idiot didn't realize I needed to adjust them) they were kind and did the best to help me out. If you wanna get that Maverick look from Top Gun, get these. I promise I haven't led you astray. Toss a Ray-Ban logo on it and no one will tell the difference....just don't actually do that...	2015-08-08

I should've just gotten another pair of converse and I wouldn't be here leaving this review while nursing my painful feet.<br />The fit is SUPER weird. It's wide and roomy because it ran really big. I am a true-to-size 38 (7.5) and I had to return these twice to get the size that would fit me without falling off of my feet with every step I take. I ended up with a whole size smaller, which seemed like a better fit when I tried them on at home with no-show socks and I had no issues with them then. They do look super cute with the crochet pattern, but OMG my feet hurt immediately the moment I walked out of my car. If it weren't for the fact that I was already running late, I would've turned back to my car and put flip flops on.<br />My feet were still pretty loose in them, I could easily slide my feet in and out the shoes without having to mess with the laces, but my toes were dying, especially my big toes. For some reason the toe area of the shoe really just tapered in and my toes were pushed all the way up against the top of the shoes. I will be in open-toed shoes for a few days just so my toes get a chance to rest and be pain-free.<br />Should've totally gotten the converse instead, at least I know those would fit me well.	2015-08-08

Just know that the buckle does not adjust but the shoe has tightness in just the right areas to keep my foot planted in the boot.

I can hike for miles in them without the slightest discomfort. I've had my eye on these burnt henna Venice H2s for about a year and finally bought them when the price dropped. They were beautiful out of the box but I was so disappointed when I put them on and found them at least half an inch too wide and a touch too short. Not only not comfortable, with my big toe touching the toe cap, but wide to the point of clunkiness. The upper is of course adjustable but you can't do anything about the sole.  I love the profile of the Whisper and these are entirely different. They just don't work for my foot. Sadly they are going back and I'll at some point get another pair of Whispers, which unfortunately don't come in this color. Hoping Keen hasn't changed the design in the last 4 years!	2015-08-08

The first set I wore for 2 years straight hiking doing gardening playing sports and they held up very well. The waterproofing works really well but I ultimately put a small hole in a part of the shoe which then needed to be mended but overall they hold out the water quite well. After they are broken in for a few weeks the fit gets better and better with each wearing.	2015-08-08

I bought a spartina bag and had a problem with the handle that began to deteriorate.  It seems to be made of a defective lower quality material.  I used the bag on occasion and it had very little wear. When I contacted the company, they did not stand behind their product. Even though the bags are stylish, I will NOT purchase again.  Very sad. Definitely not worth the price.	2015-08-08

I read other reviews saying they seemed to be narrower than standard but ordered the 12M (medium) anyway.  when they arrived they did seem a little narrow and were too tight with aftermarket insoles so I subsequently ordered the 12W, planning to compare the fit and return one or the other.  The 12W was too wide and the insole is OK so I chose to keep the 12M.  After wearing them a couple of days though I found that they are a perfect fit and I suppose that I could always remove the built-in insoles if I ever want to replace them with something with more support.  All in all, they look and feel very good and appear to be well made so I couldn't be happier with the purchase.	2015-08-08

Although I'm no biker, the wallet is still perfect for me. It is the best wallet I have ever owned. I say this for several reasons.<br />The 1st deals with the craftsmanship of the wallet. The wallet in question consists of hand proccesed, unrefined natural bovine leather along with gun metal fittings.<br />The 2nd reason I'm so fond of this wallet is deal with storage. There are two protected id compartments, a large coin pocket, two inner flaps for cards and documents, 12 card slots, two extra compartments, and two slots for bills.<br />The 3rd reason I've grown to love this wallet deals with its durability, like I said I've owned it a year and it's still in great shape, I've owned so many wallets (ones that cost significantly more than this) only to have them rip, fray, or tear after a couple months or in some cases even weeks after purchasing, not this one. You can feel the quality of this wallet just upon holding it.<br />I should note that this is a relatively bulky wallet, you will know it's in your pocket at all times, something I actually like.<br />With all that being said, if you're in the market for a wallet that offers unrivaled durability and storage, I highly suggest you give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed, it's a year later and I'm still pleased.	2015-08-08

Just like many of the reviews here, these boots fit a bit narrow. The leather is quite stiff and requires &#34;break-in time&#34;. I don't mind that part because they are super cute, but what I do mind is that they are made in Romania. The quality in no way does it remotely compare to the other black pair I own, which is made in Sweden. The difference in workmanship is HUGE! The staples are not in a straight line, the leather has discoloration and cracks, and I can see a small chip in the wooden sole. Definitely not what I would expect from premium priced boots. In regards to sizing, I felt they were true to my European size 39, which is size 8 1/2 U.S.	2015-08-08

Purchased these for my 3.5 year old mid season, She loves them,  they are comfortable and very pretty on any dress or outfit.  My only gripe was the zipper in the back, it seemed to have no real function, as the shoe's leather is too stiff for you to use the zipper as a on off function.  Its just there.  I suppose every now and them it allows her to remove the shoes... albiet with much effort by only zipping down the back.  I kind of wish they were velcro, but same stye so the on and off would be faster, and also easily doable for her.  This requires the parent to sit the child down, get on your knees, and spend a good few minutes getting the strap in the belt,  there are two on each shoe.  this is not a throw on and go sandal,  it requires patience and a few minutes before you leave.  Not ideal, but doesnt take away from the style, quality and wear of the shoe.<br /><br />Good buy at the right price!	2015-08-08

I walked into the local shoe mall today just to try a few different pairs of running shoes on, with the sole intent on coming home and finding them cheaper here, on amazon. Luckily the kind young gentleman helping me was a kinesiology major at the local university. He took the time to also explain a few things to me. Being a former Nike loyalist, I must say that after trying on a few really overly priced pairs that lacked so much in support and cushioning, I decided to return to my new found loves, Asics. I tried a pair of these puppies on and couldn't take them off! They were truly amazing, the color scheme, the support, and OMG... the cushioning!!!!! The cushioning alone sold me. I instantly felt like I was walking on a cloud. Since I have arthritis, my running years are long gone, but I still work out and occasionally lightly jog. These fit true to size and fit like a dream, especially in the toe box (the mesh has quite a bit of give for my wide duck feet). Give them a try, they just might follow you home like mine did!	2015-08-08

I really wanted to like these sunglasses. But, in no way will they ever work for me. I purchased these sunglasses because they were unisex and I thought they would provide a better fit for me.

THEY ARE WAY TO SMALL FOR MY FACE. It just makes me look like I have bug eyes.<br /><br />I want to clarify though, these are really nice sunglasses. They are well made and look to be high quality. But, they are small small small! If you have a small face then I recommend these. They will work well for you. Sadly, this time I'm disappointed.	2015-08-08

The sole is terrible. It's some sort of really cheap plastic. $1 slippers from Target have better traction than these. The shoelaces are a terrible plastic as well, makes tying the shoe a painful process. I've worn these shoes twice in a year. The shoe itself feels like some sort of s***ty composite material.

My old &#34;Shoes for Crew Energy&#34; worn out after 1 1/2 years. I loved them but I wanted to try something new so I bought these Sketchers based on great reviews on Amazon. Sketchers fit perfectly and very comfortable from the very first time I put them on. However after a few hours at work in a 2 story restaurant, my feet started getting tired especially on my heels. The next day I put extra insoles hoping that extra support would help. After 4 hours of slow day at work, my heels were so tired and sore.<br /><br />On the third day, I decided to pulled out my old Shoes for Crews and wore them to work. 12 hours of crazy busy day with a lot of walking and going up and down stairs, my feet felt perfectly fine.<br /><br />I don't think I can return the shoes at this point. So I'll give Sketchers a little more time hopefully my feet will adjust, or I will have to spend another $80 for a new pair of Shoes for Crews.	2015-08-08

Unfortunately, there are several flaws in the design. The all leather tongue doesn't allow for much flexibility and the sides rubbed against my ankle even with thick wool socks. I decided to still give them a chance in hopes of it loosening up over time. So, I wore them on a hike to Ricketts Glen State Park. After crossing small areas of wet trail, one of my socks was wet. I examined the boots when we got back to camp and noticed that the sole of the right boot was peeling away from the leather. I'm very disappointed as I loved my previous pair of Keen boots.	2015-08-08

I love the black pair that I already own! The shoes arrived right on time--perfect for our next-day summer vacation departure. I typically wear an 8.5 in a sandal, and these size 9 fit perfect (no half sizes). I was worries because the sizing information had worn off my other pair. But the sizing chart provided was very helpful, as I could measure my black pair with a tape measure (heal to toe) to determine the exact size to order. Lately, I've found myself basing my wardrobe decisions on whether or not I could wear my FitFlops, so thankfully I've added another color to my closet! These are hands down the most comfortable style of sandal I've ever worn!	2015-08-08

I got black suede instead of burgundy patent. However I didn't realize at first that the size was wrong and it's such a beautiful shoe, I tried it on anyway and might have kept it if it fit. Based on the fit of the 11 I think the 10 would have fit perfectly. It's also a very comfortable shoe and makes your feet look really good! I'm crushed I didn't get my size. Like I said,I liked the shoe so much that,even in the wrong colour, I'd probably have kept it if it was my size.	2015-08-08

I have been a loyal wearer of mizuno wave riders for over ten years.  Those are my go to shoes for shorter distances.  Love wave riders.  I recently had a baby and signed up for my first full marathon.  Given my post baby body (lax ligaments and fluffier than usual) and the extra distance I'll be running I decided to take a chance and order these shoes.  I'm so glad I did!  These shoes make my feet feel pampered instead of punished after long runs.<br /><br />Fit: Mizunos run narrow.  I order half a size up to compensate.<br /><br />Feel: Compared to my standard running shoes, wave riders, and my gym shoes, sayonaras, these felt much higher initially due to the extra cushioning.  That moon boot feeling disappeared the moment I walked in them.  During my runs I could still feel the road.  After my run there wasn't any aching, numbness or blisters.  Good arch support.  I may still buy the super feet green insoles for this pair since I'm used to running with them.<br /><br />Fashion: Love the aesthetic of these shoes.  The iridescent purple and turquoise combination is beautiful.  Bright enough to be seen without being overly obnoxious.	2015-08-08

However, they are so sturdy that I could barely walk comfortably in them, the flexibility was very low. I felt like I was making an effort to walk, and since I am buying them for long hours of walking while in Europe for Christmas, I realized they would not be a good fit. Also, they run small. I am normally I true 8, but always buy boots at 8.5 or 9, especially winter ones. This pair was very tight at 8.5, so I would never be able to wear warmer socks with them. A real pity as they look so good!	2015-08-08

The leather is soft, there is nice padding in the foot bed, and the craftsmanship is excellent.Unfortunately the fit isn't great. I am ideally a 9N or 9AA in most dress shoes. The 9 was just a tad short (my heel just barely hung off the back), and while the foot bed is normal or on the narrow side through the arch and heel, the toe box was definitely on the wide side, as was the ankle strap. You can buckle the ankle strap tightly, but the 2 straps going from the footbed to the ankle is too long so they slouch out instead of being close to your ankle. If your foot is normal to wide, they would probably fit great if you order a 1/2 size up.	2015-08-08

I'm returning the size 9 and keeping the 9.5, though even the 9.5 is still somewhat narrow and I only was able to wear them for a good hour then had to keep taking them off when I could to let my feet rest from the tightness.  The size 9 was very narrow and tight in the toe area.  I would recommend ordering up a full size, esp if you have a similar foot situation.	2015-08-08

(I'm one of them.)  The next time you see someone wearing a pair, ask them how long they've been a Sambas wearer.  In my life I've asked dozens of people, and I'd put the over/under on the answer at 10 years.<br /><br />What is it about this shoe that makes people come back, pair after pair, for decades?  First off, they go with a lot of outfits.  When they're new, they're classy enough that you can even get away with them in a situation when you'd normally need dress shoes.<br /><br />Next, they are comfortable.  Really, really, really comfortable.  The shoes come with a foam sole and a leather body that fit like a cardboard box when you first put them on, but in a week have completely molded to the shape of your foot.  It's an incredible feeling, like a custom shoe made just for you.  I've tried wearing my friend's Sambas in the same size, and boy was it weird.  Like a completely different shoe.  Not like &#34;Oh I can tell the difference&#34; weird, but &#34;Oh wow I need to take these off immediately&#34; weird.<br /><br />The main downside to the Samba is that because they're so pliant they wear out pretty quickly.  If you wear them every day they probably won't last a full year before they start to look and feel beat up.  Fortunately they're very reasonably priced.  I get these 3-4 pairs at a time to save the hassle.  If you've never had a pair before, which you haven't if you're bothering with product reviews, I can't urge you enough to try them out.	2015-08-08

I have at least five different pairs of their slip ons. My mom also became a fan after trying on a pair of my Toms. I bought these shoes as a gift for my mom since she had them on her Amazon wish list. When they arrived I tried them on since my mom and I wear the same size shoe. We are both a 7.5 US. They felt true to size. I was a little disappointed in the comfort of the shoe. I did not wear them for more than a few minutes but felt the soles of these shoes are not as comfy as Toms. I also noticed my mom added insoles to them so I'm guessing she didn't find them as comfy either. They are a cute pattern and all the colors make them wearable with pretty much anything. I guess these are an okay alternative to Toms if you want something a little cheaper but I am still a die hard Toms fan. Much more comfortable to me and it's nice to know my purchase provides another in need with a pair of shoes. Worth the extra money in my opinion!	2015-08-08

Hush Puppies are the best! I got her, her first pair for Pre-K 2 years ago.  I also bought her a few other pairs of another popular name brand shoe but they looked so worn and dull after a week or so and the leather was way too soft....I tried that 2 years in a row and still no success with that popular brand for longevity as a school shoe.  But the Hush Puppies Pep Rally shoe lasted all year (up until probably the last month of school) to where they didn't look worn or have issues.  Of course after a school year of playing and learning, the shoes were ready for retirement....still definitely worth the money.  But honestly a shoe that gets its true wear and tear out of it with children that long was an awesome thing! They were so great, I had to hunt down another pair for her Kindergarten year last year....and now again for her 1st grade year.  It gets harder and harder every year because I guess they stopped making this style, but I wish they would continue so that she will have a pair for every year until 8th grade...LOL  They run a little big but I have learned how to buy them according to her shoe size each year.  They come in black, navy and brown.  We have had the black and brown over the years.  Thank goodness I was able to find another pair this year...just bought a black pair (Size 3M) for the school year and was so thankful to find them.  I wish I could find all 3 colors every year so that she could have a variety but we have had to manage with 1 pair a year because they are so hard to find....probably the only downfall with this shoe.	2015-08-08

I have a tendency to supinate in my natural gait. My use for these shoes was for general training indoors between weights, cardio, and infrequent classes. When I realized my old shoes (also New Balance) were no longer cutting it, I contacted New Balance support for suggestions, and this was a recommendation based on my needs. I purchased these in my usual 8's in a wide - same as my last pair of New Balance shoes. These shoes offer cushion, and the foam has great responsiveness. At first, it feels like walking on air. Going from a studier shoe to the 822v2 was a completely different experience -- one I very much enjoyed.  After a few sets of lunges and squats, I noticed the fatal flaw in these shoes when my feet were inexplicably unsteady. With my narrow heel, this shoe offers no support and stability at the back of the shoe. The heel is basically all foam padding without any structure. This caused a lot of slippage. After switching to cardio, I noticed the heel bunching up at the bottom where the heel meets the sole of the shoe. I tried lacing them tighter and with different lacing patterns to keep my heel in place, which only caused my foot to go numb towards the outside metatarsals.  I discussed this with my chiropractor, who is also a fitness junkie. She was once brand loyal to New Balance (as I am/was), until a fellow student in school did a study wherein they deconstructed multiple brands of athletic shoes. New Balance rated really low on construction and actual foot support. She mentioned Saucony, Brooks, and Asics for great gym shoes (I've decided to try a pair of Brooks).  So while these 822v2 shoes look great, weigh almost nothing, and make you feel light as a feather, they don't quite offer the necessary support when needed. They do run true to size where length is concerned, though seem to run a little narrower. I will still keep these shoes for running errands around town, but they don't fit the purpose for which they were purchased.  UPDATE: I'm coming back a short time later to say these shoes are truly a disappointment. I used to love the New Balance brand, but these are a joke. You'd be better off purchasing a piece of foam and affixing a lace up sock to the top of it. These provide absolutely no structure to stabilize your foot. Waste of money.	2015-08-08

The chains on the straps make quite a bit of noise while walking and I'm not a huge fan of drawing attention to myself.<br />The inside is decent because it has a zipper which separates some of my items and a pocket for my cell phone and chapstick. I wish it had a middle divider like my other MK because it provides more separation and is easier to find things in. It also has another zipper in that divider.

These shoes rubbed a little on the back of my heel at first, but after a couple days of wearing them they fit perfectly with no rubbing! I like the look of them, and they look just like the picture. They are quite comfortable too, I wore them all day working as a day care teacher and my feet didn't hurt at the end if the day. My feet still smelled funky at the end of the day, but that happens in most shoes when I don't wear socks...so it's not the shoe's fault. I got them wet a few times and they dried pretty quickly. I also like that I can tighten the strap if I need to, for example if I am going into deeper water or mud. They don't feel like they would come off anyway but I like having an extra security measure there. I have also washed them twice in the washing machine and they came out just fine both times (I didn't dry them, just left them out to air dry). I would recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable, secure, yet ventilated shoe!	2015-08-08

I buy one size larger in Bernie Mev shoes and then they fit perfectly.  I can wear them all day at the mall and my feet are not tired.  That's a big plus now that I'm taking my picky daughter back to school shopping --- I need comfy feet to get through the day.<br /><br />These shoes look great with all my casual outfits and I've gotten compliments on them.

The boots themselves are not the entire issue here. Quite frankly they seem reletively well made, and look nice...if you lack sense of smell (more on that in a moment). These boots are the epitome of a &#34;MANS BOOT&#34;. They are strictly a black leather booth without any bells or whistles. Typically I wear boots that are more casual and less practical, and I suppose I expected that's what I would be receiving. As it turns out they're more military-type shoes, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. When I received the boots (in horrible packaging...dented box and ripped brown paper) I could smell them before ripping off the tape. The leather smell is so potent it's almost nauseating. I've purchased many leather boots and have never smelled something like this before. I tried them on and decided they were too big (about half a size larger than expected), and made the decision to return them. I began the return process and was extremely disatisfied when I read that I would have to pay for the return shipping. I thought that was odd, but what really irreItated me was the fact that I would also have to pay an $11 restocking fee for shoes that were too big and too smelly. When purchased, they were about $47, so I decided it would cost more time, hassle, and half of what I spent on the smelly things than I wanted to put forth so I figured I would just keep them. It's been over a month of them sitting in the box in my closet and every time I enter my closet I'm hit with the foul stench of leather mixed with stale cigarette ashes (because after weeks of owning these shoes I've determined that's exactly what they smell like!).<br /><br />Overall, I will not be purchasing anything from Polar Fox again, due to the ridiculous restocking fee and lack of free returns. If you're looking for a more &#34;fashionable&#34; or casual boot, I recommend Steve Madden.	2015-08-08

People.... please start writing decent reviews ,focus on what matters and be specific. Writing comments like &#34;great shoes&#34; or &#34;great for climbing rocks&#34; is not helpfuI!!! want to start by saying that these shoes run about 1 full size smaller than your normal shoe size. These are lined fully synthetic material and are not going to stretch much. So if they are extremely painful when you first try them on, they most likely will stay that way! I alway hear people say that climbing shoes should be extremely painful which is not true. They should fit correctly! Being in pain will adversely affect your climbing. Everyone's foot is different which affects how a shoe fits. My big toe is slightly longer than the others which makes it necessary to size up. This is a high performance shoe and is best suited for intermediate to advanced climbers that require precise toe and heal hooking performance. Sole has really good traction and i agree with one of the other reviewers that it tends to wear quickly. Great shoe shoe for vertical overhanging routes where you need that extra toe pronation. Over all a great shoe!!	2015-08-08

I am a womens sz 9 - I don't like my toes squished and these shoes are nice and wide as they are. Shoe looks nice, my co-workers liked them enough to look into them too .	2015-08-08

Last year I wore these outside at my cabin in the mountains for several hours chopping wood and doing things outside in several inches of snow. My feet never got cold (was wearing thick merino wool socks too) and they were extremely comfortable. Bear in mind that I'm a city-slicker computer nerd trying to pass myself off as a mountain man (too much Discovery Channel I suspect). So I fully expected to wuss out and start complaining about the cold or whatever. However these boots didn't let me down! Next up will be wearing these during deer season.	2015-08-08

It seems that many small details were thought out in the construction of this bag, although I would suggest minor improvements.<br /><br />The bag is creatively made of two zippered pouches (the size of the bag) that encompass a center compartment that just invited my Macbook 15&#34; retina right in. So perfect was the fit that the very powerful magnetic latch that prevents the laptop from falling out even fit over top and latched.  Inside of that compartment that is Large enough for a 12&#34; tablet but is sewn in the middle to make two smart phone sized pouches.  These are clearly for the power cord and accessories for the laptop.<br /><br />One side of the Zippered compartment has three sewn divisions that invite pens and business cards and folders and the other side is a larger zippered pouch that accommodates a tablet with no problem. On the front of the case is a slit for easy access to a phone or something you use like ear buds. It's small but innocuous.<br /><br />The strap was the only real disappointment for me. It is a canvas brown that matches the bag in color but within minutes mine was attracting every lose cat hair and piece of lint which diminishes the look just a bit. It would be easy to find a replacement so it's not that big of a deal.<br /><br />There is a big cloth bag inside that's nice to have if you our out and realize you can't fit everything into your workbag.  I'm not ashamed to have my bags anywhere I go. I'm always needing my lotion, eye drops and a change of sunglasses and I was hoping this could be a bag for such necessities. And it COULD be, I just have to get used to not having more diverse compartments.<br />The only thing that takes a star from this bag is the strap,  but otherwise it is a perfect contender as a smart professional accessory that should last for years.	2015-08-08

A cute Asian podiatrist told me that the pain I was experiencing while walking was because I have arthritis in the ball joint of my feet, (weird). Told me to get special shoes and/or Powerstep inserts. I got both and besides making me just a little taller, I can walk all day long with no pain. This is my 2nd pair of this same shoe because I like them so much, and they look kind of sporty.<br /><br />My first pair come with an extra set of shoelaces and the side Velcro straps but these didn't, but then again I paid a lot more for my first pair than these. The price has come down since then. My first pair lasted some 4 or 5 years. They only started looking worn after several runs in the washing machine (remove inserts first).<br /><br />You normally never think about how utterly dependent you are on your feet until they start giving you trouble. I like to go barefoot but mine are so bad now I can't walk across the room shoeless without discomfort.	2015-08-08

Keep in mind, bang for buck is a part of the 4 star rating. These Vans were comfortable for a while.  The neoprene heal is awsome.!  I wore them casually and at work. They didn't appear to have the trademark reinforcements that skate shoes possess so I didn't skate them at 1st.  After 3 or 4 months I developed sores on the balls of my feet, as soon as I switched shoes, my feet healed up. Since I had to give up daily use of these shoes, I started skating them. I was pleasantly surprised at how durable the toe area and Ollie area on these shoes were. I've skated these Vans 3 times a week for 6-8 months. I did eventually wear through the toe from kickflips and the Ollie area, but a little shoe goo in all the right places and these suckers are still kicking.  They weren't perfect, but I got a lot of use out of these shoes and they were great to skate in.	2015-08-08

They were so narrow I could not even get close to fastening the velcro. My son is very skinny and has long skinny feet, he has never even come close to wearing a wide shoe.

If you're looking for a no-cushion, zero-drop running shoe, to somewhat feel the ground with, then like me, these is great! Note: These shoes definitely RUN BIG. Four or more years ago my original Merrell Dash Glove shoes were a 7.5 (I typically wear an 8). I bought these in a 7 (which I NEVER wear) because I tried other similar Merrell shoes on in the store before purchasing these.  Merrell has DEFINITELY made their shoes bigger. I appreciate the very flexible sole of the shoes (I can hold it and bend it in every direction). Unimportant, but I really like the design of the corral/turquoise one's. Fyi, I also purchased the Merrell Dash Glove 3 at REI (in a kind of ugly plain black design) which have 4mm of cushion and a bridge of &#34;support&#34; in the arch. The soles are better for running on trails with lots of rocks. But, they are also great too.	2015-08-08

Overall, I am happy with my purchase, but there are also a couple of things that caused me to knock a star off of my rating.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />There's no denying that it's a stylish bag, and it holds its structure even when there's nothing in it. The handles and outer material seem very sturdy. There's a big outside pocket, perfect for a cell phone, small tablet, e-reader, or any other semi-flat item you need easy access to. It's the perfect size for many of the things I need to carry around, but not overly large. Also, the handbag sits flat on a set of metal feet, which is convenient for those situations when you need to plop your bag down on a table or floor.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I ordered the black bag, and the hardware is actually gold instead of silver, even though the description explicitly says that the hardware is silver. For me, it's not a big enough deal to want to return it, but I know this would be a dealbreaker for some people.<br /><br />Also, my bag didn't come with an attachable shoulder strap, and I expected it to because of the one shown in the pictures of the brown bag. The handles are only big enough to hold the bag at the crook of my elbow, not my shoulder, so a longer strap would have been handy!<br /><br />The lining seems very thin and like it would tear rather easily, but I don't feel I can be too picky about that considering how nice the outer material is. Also, there is a particular smell to the faux leather, but it's not any different than any other synthetic bag I've bought in the past, and it will most likely fade over time.<br /><br />If I didn't like the appearance of this bag so much, these negatives might seem like a bigger deal to me, but I still like it and plan on using it as my everyday bag this fall.	2015-08-08

So comfortable and waterproof. I wore them camping and hiking a week ago, and I could not stop talking about them to my friend. They had so much grip hiking and when I stepped in the river, my feet did not get wet because they are waterproof.<br /><br />My husband is now in the process of ordering some because I have raved about them so much to him 👍🏻<br /><br />The only negative is the sizing is really off. Not sure why, but they are. I wear a size 8.5 women's. I ordered a 8.5 women's and when they came they fit more like a size 9.5/10. Huge!<br /><br />So I sent back and ordered a women's size 7.5. They fit perfect! My advice: whatever size you where, order one full size down.	2015-08-08

To adjust for this I place insoles in my shoes that feel a bit wide to snug them up so that my foot doesn't slide in the shoe while walking.  These hiking boots also fit a bit wide on my feet so I inserted an arch support type of insole.  It made them feel even more comfortable and cushioned on the bottom of my feet.  I wore them for about 8 hours to give them a good try, and they felt great.  Besides feeling good on my feet, they are very attractive.  My daughter even commented on how cute the boots were.  I plan to wear them for more than just hiking and camping, as I had planned.  These are so cute I want to wear them for all sorts of occasions.  Thanks to Hi-Tec for making a woman's boot that doesn't look so manly and ugly.	2015-08-08

I have tried a number of tennis shoes (Asics Gel Resolution 5, Acids Speed Solution 2/Slam 2, Adidas Barricade 2015, Head Mens Spring Pro, K Swiss Ultra, and Adidas Feather III) and the Prince T22 felt the most comfortable and true to size. The second most comfortable shoe was the Asics Gel Resolution 5, but the sizing was off - actually they feel a size larger, and too narrow for my taste. No break in is needed for the Price T22 and they are ready to go right from the box. These are also the best selling tennis shoes in the US! They are worth at least trying.	2015-08-08

This is a case that works great, has a very large capacity (but not too large - don't want anything banging around in there), and is styled quite well.  Having had it about two weeks, I have found that the jaws of this case are just the right weight - very secure but also quite easy to open, and that the case itself (though I have no plans to really test it) is very sturdy.<br /><br />I deduct a star, however, because the fabric stretched over the exterior was not designed well to deal with the corners.  With a smooth pattern, I might enjoy the crimps and folds around the corners as something showing an almost hand-made sort of aesthetic, but this is highly textured case and the corners are somewhat ragged.  That's not too serious to me, but if I'm to spend $25 after buying into the already-expensive glasses, I want a pristine case out of it.	2015-08-08

They have good arch support, and can be worn all day without any discomfort. These shoes fit to size (I'm an 8.5), and have kept their shape and fit despite being worn in ocean, and as a bonus have kept relatively smell-free despite four months of constant wear! They've become my favorite pair of shoes and I can't wait to buy more pairs in the future.	2015-08-08

Really like these Hot Chocolate (Chocolaticas) shoes, red ladybug design, as well as the first pair I bought--one shoe is a copy of the cover of a black and white English composition book, and the other shoe is a copy of the lined paper that's inside that composition book. Both pairs of shoes are roomy and very comfortable, especially with the Dr. Scholl's thin liners I put inside them, but they don't offer any arch support at all. But I'm still able to wear them for many hours with no problem. They are cloth, though, so it helps to spray them with a stain repellent before wearing them. If they get dirty, you can wash the outside gently with a soft cloth and soap and water. Amazon only sells a few of the many interesting patterns and colors of this shoe brand--just Google &#34;Chocolaticas&#34; and click on Images and you'll see such an amazing array! (See attached photo for just a few of their many shoes, including some with heels, though most are flats.) I'm tempted to buy a third pair now...	2015-08-08

Earlier versions were of minimal construction, as close to barefoot as possible while still having a minimal covering--very supple and close fitting. What I have is more like a sneaker--it is more rigid and &#34;built up&#34;. Not as clunky as a conventional sneaker , but clunky compared to Lems originals.  The same thing happened to Tiger running shoes back in the 60's--they also added more support, thicker soles, etc.  Does the public demand this??<br /><br />I hope Lems returns to a more minimal shoe but I suspect that they won't and that they won't explain why.	2015-08-08

These shoes are so sweet; the style, the cut, the heel. . .the only problem is Clark's had them made in Cambodia and the size twelve<br />fits like a 9 1/2.  I usually wear 11 wide but since they only came in medium width, I up sized to a 12.  To no avail because my feet could<br />not even squeeze into them comfortably. If I coulda, I woulda, because I loved them on site, but they just won't work for me.  Now, if I<br />wore a size 6 shoe, I would have been set because I would just up size to a size 9. Anyway, I have to return them in hopes that Clark will manufacture the same shoe or a close replica in a different country where everyone does not have size three feet.	2015-08-08

Purchased this bag set to carry/organize work folders. Size wise it is perfect & fits quite a bit. The extra large insert bag was a big bonus as its like a second purse (but without  handles). The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the strong smell which took awhile to go away. I assume it's from the chemical processing. Other than that, it's a great bargain.  I've received so many compliments on it, which makes me laugh because of the price I paid (and that I used to spend way more on other bags in the past).  If you have time to air it out before using, I'd highly recommend this as a simple but great bag to have.	2015-08-08

After about a month of wearing, they have become significantly more comfortable (although they were already comfortable at the initial purchase). A couple things to note:<br />- Don't expect significant cushion -- these are thin shoes (e.g., you could probably feel it if you stepped on a rock whereas you would not in a Rainbow or an OluKai<br />- Many of the reviews say to order a size up. While this will provide more room at the end (and avoid the potential for your heel to feel 'unprotected') I would caution against this approach. By ordering the correct size is that you will avoid the 'heel smack' noise which is created by having extra material at the end of the sandal slap against your heel if you order a size up.	2015-08-08

I know that Birkenstocks need to get broken in before they feel as good as they should so I'll keep wearing them, hoping that one day they feel as comfy as my other pair.  I wear a 6.5 shoe size and ordered a 36 which fits as it should.	2015-08-08

I bought these for a friend of mine, a disabled gentleman working a full schedule to support his family of 3, including a handicapped son. He has been wearing the same, worn down and tore up pair of Dr. Scholl's for years, and when I found these I couldn't help myself. For the VERY affordable price, these are worth it. He says they fit wonderfully (14 mens, XX-Wide), providing much needed support. The memory foam seems to be the winning feature. The look and feel of these are similar to more expensive brands if using these as work shoes (non-athletic).	2015-08-08

The cushioning has separated where my heel is and air escapes every time I walk in them. The toe area is WAY too large, I could have gone down to a size 12 and been happy. There's a cavern where my toes are although I don't have a problem with the shoes slipping on me in normal walking. However trying to hike forest trails in them is a recipe for disaster. I tried to steer away from Keens since my last pair had separation on the straps. But these are 10 times worse. I wouldn't feel quite so bad is these were like $10-$15, but these were $50. Stay away!	2015-08-08

I was hesitant to order the size 7-8 after reading reviews that the shoe didn't fit as expected. I wear a size 7-7.5 shoe. They are wide enough for my feet and my foot fits comfortably inside. The length is perfect for me. They are made of a very soft lightweight non-porous foam like material that is comfortable to walk on. They are great for the pool. They tend to get a little warm making my feet sweat a bit. I bought them mainly to walk from the dressing room to the indoor pool that has a very uncomfortable non-slip knobby floor covering. Since I have peripheral neuropathy I have difficulty walking for any length of time and that is why I rated them for use up to an hour.	2015-08-08

Very happy now.  Word of warning: I dinged it one star, not because of the sneaker, but because of the troubling return policy.  Even for incorrect shoe size, Amazon CU refused to offer an exchange, only a refund.  This was a big problem since a coupon code I applied expired.  To get a bigger size would have meant a significant loss.  Don't know if Amazon will compete very well if you can't exchange shoes.	2015-08-08

A pair of these last about 1500 miles. Work in the ag service industry as a mechanic and welder by day and train hunting dogs by night. I expose them to the harshest elements daily from oil, to cow manure, to hours of water, to fertilizer. I cover all types of terrain like rocks, asphalt, concrete, timber, equipment ladders, welding shop floors, ect. They are just plain tough.  My only problem, which is not the boots fault, is I burn the strings often. They are comfortable all day of a 15 hour day.	2015-08-08

He's almost 5 and in a size 8W now. I don't mind spending a few extra dollars for good kids shoes. These are the only brand that fit his little wide feet and he never complains about his shoes. They hold up well to daily wear and would last a long time, but he gets new ones twice a year in a half size up. I only buy NB for myself as well.	2015-08-08
US	15796432	R25WAJN7ADQQJC	B00LACGQSC	874726338	DC Men's Haven TX SE Skate Shoe	Shoes	4	0	1	N	Y	Better than the Wino!!!	I had previously bought Emerica's Wino shoe, which is of a similar style and shape, so that is what I'm comparing it to.  Let it first be said that this shoe isn't a big, heavy, padded skate shoe that also doubles as a pillow for your feet. It's a sleek and stylish shoe that also happens to have decent comfort - it's light weight.  They were a bit tight/narrow at first, but once they were broken in they fit perfectly.  Emerica's Wino has absolutely no sole and is an absolute burden to wear.  On the other hand, this shoe has a great cushioned in-sole for arch support as well as a padded rim around the ankle/tongue (Wino's SHARP rim, OUCH!), which makes it a great shoe to do every day things in. I'm not positive the top of the shoe's material will hold up to too many scuffs and scrapes, so I would be wise about what you use these shoes to do.  DC's Haven's main function is style in a sleek package, which they are. They also have the added benefit of being comfortable to wear, so I would recommend even more highly than I normally would based on the travesty that is Emerica's Wino. I also think they look better than the Wino.	2015-08-08

I'm an avid fisherman and outdoorsman and have always shunned spending absurd amounts of money on polarized glasses.

After the initial 13 hour fishng trip test, I immediately ordered another 2 pair to have for the future. Do yourself a favor and pick some up.	2015-08-08

I wore them around the house a couple of days, to see how they would feel before wearing them outside. They felt comfortable inside, but wearing them outside was a different story. After wearing them a couple of hours outside. The foot padding, up by the padding of the toes felt like there was a lump under the insole. Which really felt uncomfortable. All in all I would rate these sandals 60%. My expectations of this product was okay. I don't feel they were worth the price compared to another brand that was half the price.<br /><br />Joanne	2015-08-08

I have been wearing aviators since the 80's so I know my Ray-Bans. My daughter bought me a pair of these about 5 years ago and I wear them all the time to drive or anytime I am out in the sun, except for fishing- I use Costa 580g green glasses.I decided to buy another pair for my other car. I have yet to find a better, distortion free lens than these. Glass will not ever distort no matter how hot the environment  and are much more scratch resistant than plastic. One of the advantages of these is that they can be worn in direct sunlight or in a car in full summertime brightness to lower light conditions without feeling like they are too dark. I prefer Non-polarized lenses while driving because of the lack of distraction from seeing through polarized glass. The Costa's are better for fishing for being the opposite from these. Polarized to see fish through the water, much darker for more intense reflected light off the water and thicker temple to block sunlight from the side.  Also, these frames are very durable, being able to be bent to fit the face and over the ears whenever adjustments are needed. Another advantage of these glasses, like the aviators is the thinness of the temple/ear piece. When driving these sunglasses never obscure your vision to the side and aid in avoiding the dreaded lane change into someones front fender. I put my old pair next to the new ones and they seem identical, a tribute to their durability.	2015-08-08

This is my third pair of Skechers On the Go Flagship (boat) shoes. The &#34;goga mat&#34; insole is the most comfortable I've ever worn (hence the 3 pairs). I'm tempted to buy the navy & white stripe again before they are gone for good. I've worn my navy/white ones most of the summer and I'm very surprised how a &#34;cloth&#34; shoe has held up so well. I finally threw them in the washing machine (let them air dry, no dryer) and they look exactly as they did when I bought them. The purple ones did not disappoint. They are a heather purple, as shown, which makes the color a bit softer, but still purple as I wanted. They fit like my other 2 pairs. As for size, I typically take a size 9B (9.5 in a dress shoe, maybe) and I bought the 9 and they fit perfectly. In addition to the very cushion-y insole, the outer sole is a soft but durable rubber (I guess) that seems to be an excellent shock absorber. The shoes are very lightweight; great for walking and for packing on a trip. I love a tie shoe because you can loosen it as the day wears on and your feet get a little larger. It also means the heel doesn't slip on my narrow heels. I have difficult feet--nothing is comfortable on them for very long, but when I put these Skechers on, I just feel like I want to walk. Finally. (FYI, I wear these shoes with the Sheec brand invisible socks, purchased on Amazon.) Just for fun, they come with 2 pairs of laces, white & the shoe color.	2015-08-08

It's not as pictured, but looks more like brown that has yellowish tint mixed in. So, much lighter but not biege. I bought a size 9B which are somewhat narrower than other 9Bs. They fit snug, but  that's OK for me since my true size is a narrowl. Although snug. they are still comfortable.  I have not worn them yet. I have only walked around in my closet. I think they will be comfortable enough for all day, as long as I am not on my feet the entire time.	2015-08-08

They were all so pretty in their own way. I decided on the gold because winter is coming and the gold looks so eloquent in the pictures.In person it's even more exquisite. The design on the front gives it a nice pop but is subtle enough not to take away from the rest of the bag.<br />This is not a gaudy, tacky gold color that reminds me of fake gold. This is a very nice color that will go with everything from jeans to one of your dressier dresses. The accents are also gold and they are a nice color and quality. The butterfly decoration is optional so it can be transferred from one bag to the other than back again.<br />The inside lining is very nicely made is sturdy. I NEED that in a handbag because I stuff my purses. Sometimes my liner rips and things get lost underneath it. I have no fear of this material ripping any time soon.  The bottom of the strap is reinforced with metal which is yet another way the quality shines through. This will ensure that the fabric of the strap does not rip under the wear and tear of everyday use. The smallest clutch has a clasp to close it so it will stay closed.<br />Now there are THREE bags in this set and they can all be used for different things or they some of them can work together.  The smallest clutch can easily be a makeup bag and slip into the larger bag. The medium size is perfect for a night out because it will fit a lot of things and it's not bulky. All three bags have straps/handles that are long enough to carry comfortably.<br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.	2015-08-08

I did order a larger size at first because of the reviews.  I'm often either a 9 or a 9.5, but after reading the reviews about how narrow they were, I first ordered a 9.5 Wide.  They were huge!  Thankfully, I could return them quickly with no cost through Amazon.  I just dropped them off at the UPS office and had the size 9 two days later.  The size 9M fit just fine, and I did find them to be very comfortable when I wore them all night last night.  I'll update after my trip . . . I'm back & found these shoes to be great walking shoes.  Very comfortable & pretty cute, too.  I'm so glad I brought them with me!  They were worth the room they took up in my backpack, and I've found myself wearing them a lot at home because they're just comfortable.	2015-08-08

The color will match so much of my wardrobe. They have a little arch support. They are wide enough for me to insert my orthotic foot pads. Extremely comfortable. I usually wear a 9, but this sneaker has a round toe so the 9 1/2 gives more than enough room. I am very happy with this purchase. I was also able to use both sets of laces to make them look extra special. Thanks again VRLT.	2015-08-08

She spends a lot of time on her feet, working, and was killing her legs wearing flip flops all the time. I knew I needed to find something that was cute, comfortable and lightweight or she wouldn't wear them. These fit the bill all the way around and have the quality of the Van name, as well. She loves them!<br /><br />I am not really sure on the &#34;unisex&#34; for this particular pair, as they are bright yellow with a floral pattern. I suppose some guys might like them, I am not one to judge, but generally I would say that this particular style is more feminine. Cute shoes with a solid sole.	2015-08-08

At first he said they felt a bit stiff and not so comfy on the top of his foot but after they break in a bit (and you can actually sand down any rough spots with a magic eraser lol!) they are now great and the foam squishy foot bed is expecially comfortable. Really versatile - around the house, to the beach, even for a casual lunch -they are not like dollar store or ON ones that are a few bucks. Really nice look - we got the green with orange accents - and they go with everything. Very well made, sturdy rubber/good shape.<br /><br />They fit him a slight bit small, is normally a 10.5-11 and he has the 10, which fits right to the end - if you want a larger fit order a normal size and you should be okay.<br /><br />We got these for a great price - around $13.00 which seems to be on the very low end (now around $15-$30 depending on size and color.) Well worth it at $25 or below in our opinion and the company is good about warranty replacements for the first year if you need one. Definitely recommend these.	2015-08-08

My girlfriend bought these shoes and she absolutely LOVED them.  She has a really hard time buying shoes because she has wide feet but these were perfect.  She was worried because of the slight pointed toe but it's actually quite spacious and she feels comfortable in them.  They look like &#34;Little house on the Prairie&#34; shoes but that's the look she was going for.  She also has very toned calves so she was worried that they would make her calves look bigger but they don't!  They look good on her when she's wearing skinny jeans, leggings, or tights.  Her favorite part is that fact that they make the click-clack sound when she walks outside.<br /><br />Overall take:very comfortable, fashionable, and spacious in the toe area but not too wide.	2015-08-08

I had only had mine 3 months and one of mine fell off while I was just walking. I contacted the company. They sent me a returns form and told me to ship them back at my cost from the states to UK and that if they looked at them and determined it was not a manufacturing defect that there was &#34;not much they'd be able to do for me.&#34; So I opted to take them to a local cobbler. He determined the heels were only glued on. He is replacing both heels, nailing them in for me for less than I believe it would have cost me to ship them to the UK. I really wish I hadn't had to have done this after only 3 months, seems like customer service should have stood behind their product a little longer than that,  but I am still happy with the look of them and I get lots of compliments every time I wear them. Medium Quality for a Great Price.	2015-08-08

I wear them almost every day.  Unfortunately both clips on the sides fell off after less than 2 months.  I don't think they do anything and are there just as part of the design but it makes me wonder about the quality of the rest of the shoe.	2015-08-08

I will have to pad them to tighten the fit.  I bought a size 9, because I think an 8.5 might be a tad short for my big toe on my left foot. I have only tried them on and feel that with padding, I can wear them all day, but not if I'm going to be on my feet all day. Also, there is more green than turquoise, which I didn' t realize when I ordered them.  No problem.  The color combination will just expand  wearability with some other items.	2015-08-08

I purchased this MK handbag in February, 2015, about 6 months ago and I really loved it.<br />I purchased this handbag in February, 2015 about 6 months ago and I absolutely loved it.  However it has frayed on the bottom of the bag on two corners where the binding has opened up and the plastic stuffing has come out.  This is a handbag that I paid $265.00 for and I believe<br />that this should definitely not have happened since it is a Michael Kors bag and I think the quality should be much better than this and for the amount of money I paid for it.  I am  very disappointed that this happened for the quality of this bag.  I hope there is something that can be done and I want others to know about this.

I have since ordered two more pairs of the Docksider Spinnaker boat shoe<br />and they are a great value for the prices I paid: $49 for the last pair and $62 for the prior.  The price disparities on Amazon<br />continue to benefit a comparative shopper, as sales of 80% or more are possible, and 40 - 50% routine on a myriad of products.<br /><br />This is especially true with clothing and shoes, given that certain sizes and colors which are popular can cost more than three to four the price of the same exact item in a less popular color or size.<br /><br />When one considers that oneu can purchase three items for the price one, these savings (especially in these difficult economic times)<br />are truly significant.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I recently ordered another pair of these Docksiders, however, they were never delivered.  According to some other Amazon customers, Amazon is now using its own delivery service to deliver certain products that are ordered through its Website.<br /><br /> A number of Amazon users reported that they never received the products which  they ordered under this delivery<br />service.  When contacted, Amazon representatives apologized for delays. However, in far too many instances<br />the packages shipped by Amazon through this service weren't just delayed; they never arrived at all.<br /><br />So until Amazon can straighten this situation out, caveat emptor.<br /><br />I have owned these Sebagos for slightly over a year now and they have stood up very well.  The suede<br />dye initially bleeds through if it gets wet. (Keep this in mind for all suede shoes you purchase)<br /><br /> A few pairs of  white socks had blue streaks running through them after the Sebagos got wet.<br /><br />However, the problem appears to have cleared up after the initial bleed through.<br /><br />Apart from this caveat,  these boat shoes have stood up well.  I wear them daily.  Years ago I bought a pair<br />of Sperry Topsiders once a year, and wore them several times a week.  By the end of a year they were falling<br />apart.  The Sebagos appear to be better stitched.  The blue suede has faded a bit, however, I may be able<br />to darken it with some suede cleaner.  The leather continues to hold up well.<br /><br />I paid about $78 for these shoes on Amazon last year and just purchased a second pair of the exact same shoe for<br />on Amazon for about $20 less.  With the way prices for products on Amazon fluctuate, it pays to comparison  shop  before you make your purchase.<br /><br />If you are thinking about purchasing a product on Amazon,  track it for a week or so.  You might be surprised how much the price for the same product can fluctuate; either saving as much as 50%, or costing you  significantly more.<br /><br />Earlier..<br /><br />Very comfortable shoes.

So I automatically buy the either the 2E or 4E size. About 3 years ago, I noticed new balance changed. What used to fit me was a 2E, Since then I now buy the 4E size shoes. That said, I really like the shoes, and pretty much is the only thing I buy. I have noticed that the quality year to year seems to be going down, in small increments. Still for me they are the best thing out there, which earns them a solid 4 stars.	2015-08-08

They fit as expected, which is narrow and snug, but they loosen up as they mold to your foot.  These were an excellent price (1/3 the local sporting-goods store cost).<br /><br />For a Jr player, just starting out, these have additional cleats for support and balance, and they work well on hard, natural-surfaces or turf, and allow for reasonable balance on concrete (walking to the field).<br /><br />As with all Puma and Adidas soccer boots, ankle cut-outs are low, which allow for greater range of motion, and  allow for wearing ankle-guards, without causing pressure-points or pain while running.  Arch-support is adequate.  Offset lacing allows for better ball control, and the surface of the shoe has great grip on the ball.	2015-08-08

She thought it might have been from heat during shipping. I don't think so bc mine are bent on a curve too. They're not comfortable but not painful either. The velvet feels nice on the bottom of my feet (like slippers) but the cheap plastic makes them a little clunky & stiff. The bend didn't help that. I'm keeping them since they were only 7 bucks & they're good to just have around; which shows they're not so bad that I'll return them. Good spares, I guess, but they are definitely cheaply made & why they're so cheap in price.	2015-08-08

I ordered in Wide based on some other reviews and am glad I did. Their Wide seems like a normal width from any other company. The build quality is exceptional – this company rocks. The sole feels like it propels me forward when walking. Toe cap seems well-sealed and the lacing is not bad. Very comfortable and they look great. I was hoping the beluga color to be a bit lighter in person, but in actuality it was a dark charcoal.	2015-08-08

These fit very comfortably,  with No Plantar pain!  I was also told to break any Vionic in by wearing a couple hours at a time, do to the arch support.  I'd ruptured my achilles tendon, so now I also have plantar fasciitis on that foot.  I just bought this shoe on Amazon as the store didn't have my size, plus they were $30.00 less on Amazon.

I listened to the other reviews and went down a 1/2 a size and they fit o.k., slightly tight on my right foot but not uncomfortable and they are stretchy. I got these to wear in the water so it's probably better they fit snugger than loose so the suction from the sand and water won't pull them off. Really cute and nicely priced. Not heavy duty like others, but much sturdier than water socks; so unless you're going in water with extremely big rocks these should work nicely.	2015-08-08

Not dressy but not supposed to be.mnot sloppy either but just perfect. I ordered my usual size 9 in Teva and they fit perfectly over a medium weight sock. I have very muscular calves and find most boots are too snug but these were just right. Since there are straps with buckles I can adjust to for a perfect fit over jeans or leggings or even just thin tights and get a nice look. I'm so happy. Plus I am 5'3&#34; and these come to just a little below the knee which is perfect. Knee high boots are too high and cut into back of my knee. If you have narrow calves, these are not for you so don't order them and then complain. Just try something else.	2015-08-08

I originally got the whiskey and dark brown colors but the whisky was a bit too red for my taste and dk.brown was almost plum colored and didn't really go with much...so I returned them and got the &#34;natural&#34;. It's perfect and has a warm caramel corn type color, which goes with EVERYTHING I own, and I also must note that for some reason the closure strap is longer and it folds better than the whisky color. The pictures are pretty accurate but it's way nicer in person. It's such a simple bag, excellent quality leather, and I have already received compliments! The main compartment in spacious and has two internal slip pockets. Then there is an outer pocket with an internal zip pocket. It's really the perfect organization.... Not too many &#34;black holes&#34; if you know what I mean. I plan on using it forever.	2015-08-08

I am trying to glue them back. If that doesn't work I'll take them to the local cobbler shop. I initially considered replacing them because overall I liked them, but at $100 ($33/yr) not so much. It would have been 5 stars if they had not come apart. I still have the shoe box, using it to hold junk.

The smell! After taking all the tissue off the handles, and pulling the packing material out of the pockets, hold the satchel up to your nose and take a whiff. Can you smell that? Isn't it heavenly? There is nothing like the smell of a brand new leather handbag. Some people like to smell new cars, but give me the smell of a fine leather handbag. It makes me feel connected to the world.<br /><br />Here is another cool thing about the satchel: it makes you feel powerful. I am female, not tall, not beautiful, not confident. But when I walk into a meeting with a fine leather handbag, I feel bigger. I feel professional. I feel like, as long as I have the best tools and the best armor, I can hold my own. I can swim with the sharks. Yeah, that's right, sharks, you heard me! I have a fine leather handbag, and I'm not afraid to pull some stuff out of it, so pay attention! You can't ignore a woman with a bag like this!<br /><br />Seriously, this is luxury product that will make you feel special. Go for it. You will be glad you did.	2015-08-08

The style was cute, but the leather was quite stiff and they just didn't fit my feet correctly. The arch hit at a weird point, and the back of the heel didn't feel right when walking. I have an office job, but walk quite a bit during the day. I don't think I could have worn these all day in comfort. I wouldn't have wanted to wear them out shopping, or on an evening out that would involve any significant walking. I'm an active person, and my footwear needs to accommodate that fact.  That all said, it could just be my feet. They may be perfectly fine for someone else. I wear a size 5, but do not have narrow feet. And thanks to all the running I do and abuse to my feet, I absolutely need adequate support and cushioning.	2015-08-08

I am awesome	First off let me say, these things are huge..... huge..... huge..... I mean its like somebody at Oakley said hey ski goggles are awesome, is there anyway we can make ski goggle style sun glasses..... and some dude drew up these giants face shields..... thus the birth of the Jawbreaker.<br /><br />1) Extremely Light and flexible - Yes there huge, but this babies are light. Now I have seen other reviews which comment on the cheapness feeling of the frame and generally the plastic. After opening the package and feeling the shades I can see why some may experience this feeling. The arms have all these sharp corners and cuts (oakley making a move from there smooth curves we see on the radar line) and really are thin considering the size of the lens. When I first picked them up the arms almost felt too skinny and they flex like hell. I was like, &#34;yeah it feels like a cheap imitation Transformer you buy at a Dollar store.&#34; But then I put them on and they felt great. Yes they feel cheap, but what you give up in feel and look, you get in performance. They are light and the flexibility in the legs are welcomed on the sides of your head. In my opinion this was deliberate move on Oakley's part. Here they are making huge face shields for people who are looking for performance sport wear and they are like &#34;Man we need to cut out as much plastic as we can to make this baby as light as possible&#34; Sure they could have made them out of a really expensive material that is basically impossible to break and light at the same time.... like hmmmmm.... I don't know carbon fiber.... but then you would have a pair of shades wrapped around your head with about as much give as a bear trap. Again I don't disagree with the feeling of cheapness.... but I believe the benefit of weight and flexibility outweighs the &#34;feeling.&#34;<br /><br />2 - Field of vision - The jawbreakers only positive in my opinion over the radar is in the aero position on a bike or even drop bars you havea clear forward view with no obstruction from the top of the frames. However, when running with the shades you can definitely see both the bottom of the frame and sides of the frames in your field of vision, unlike the radar which has no bottom frame or side frame. For those of us who spend a considerable amount time in aero or drop these definitely give you a great view.<br /><br />3 - Optics - Perfect. I did not notice any weird reflections or distortion. Pretty much what you can expect from Oakley as far as clarity and function.<br /><br />4 - Style - I will say it again, these things are huge. They are not for the guy or girl who wants to be subtle. No these things scream look at me, I'm awesome and I know it. Don't get me wrong there is a time and place for everything, but these things only belong in a few places. These are not the type of shades you wear on the weekend to the beach, or out on the boat, at disney world, or hanging out at a BBQ. No, honestly if you wear these things anywhere other then a sporting event in which you are actually performing in.... well.... your just trying too hard. These things are design to worn on a bike, competing in a triathlon, training rides, running on the beach, completing in a 5k, 10k, marathon..... and trust me.... they make you look awesome. Look maybe you don't have that athletic look or that intimidating face that says, am going to crush this ride, race, training session, etc....... when you put these on, no matter how baby your face is..... you look mean and serious.<br /><br />All and all I was extremely pleased with them. Oakley did not disappoint. Now if only they would make a shawn white version with the 24k lens..... baller!!!!	2015-08-08

The size on the actual shoes differed from the size printed on the shoe box. Amazon customer service immediately authorized a return: excellent service!  I really liked the shoes and regretted the need to return them, but the pair I was sent just didn't fit me at all. (I have so many foot problems that I'd just assumed they didn't feel right because my feet never feel right....) If the price goes down again I may order again in the correct size since they  provided bunion relief and had great cushioning for ball of foot and heel, all problem areas for me. Arch support was also okay though may not be enough for anyone with high arches without an insert. (Next time I'll check to make sure the shoes in the box match the size printed on the box before wearing!)	2015-08-08

These are fantastic!!!  I ordered a 6.5 since so many reviews said they were too small in their normal size.  I wear a 6 in everything else, but the 6.5 in these is *perfect*.<br /><br />I have been wearing them since December -nearly every day- and the entire slipper is still supportive and cushioned like the first time I put them on.  Only some friction wear of the fuzzy inside, but you don't notice it during wear.  I wore 90% of the time without socks and there is NO ODOR WHATSOEVER.  But, if you ARE going to wear socks, consider ordering a FULL size up from your norm...with socks, they are very snug.<br />As to warmth, these are very warm when your feet are cold, but aren't terribly stifling on 90 degree days - IF you keep your A/C at 78 or cooler.  The shoe and the sole look remarkably new, even after 8 months of constant wear.  I wear them outside and on hardwood floors.  I have worn them to run to a convenience store, but the furry trim prevents me from pushing to the supermarket, since they do really look like slippers.<br />I will be asking 'Santa' for another pair, but only to get a pair without the trim, so that I could wear them out in the world!  The basket weave texture of this slipper is soooo nice and looks really interesting...plus, it seems to repel moisture to some extent, as I dripped coffee on them one very groggy morning. Ok, I flat-out slopped coffee all over one!  But, it just kind of rolled off, so that was one less thing I had to clean up as a result.<br />Bottom line: ditch the Dearfoams and invest in Bob's.  Order a half or full size up.  Don't worry about quality, warmth, aesthetic appeal, or stinky slipper smell.  These will outlast any other slippers you can buy for this kind of money and even some costing 2x as much.  I waited to do this review until I was sure they were as good as they seemed at first, and it's safe to say THEY ARE!!!<br />Happy lounging.  You're welcome ; )	2015-08-08

I love the flexible soles on these shoes - it makes a lot of sense for a toddler on the go. My daughter seems to love them.

I remember thinking that it'd be great to find a pair that somewhat bridge the gap between the toe-shoes and more formal/casual shoes aesthetically. I even considered cannibalizing the soles from an old pair and attempting to cobble up my own lol. Lo-and-behold before I get the chance to do so I find these.<br />They've been my daily shoes since arriving and they're holding up pretty well. The vinyl/pleather is starting to peel a bit from the edges of the toe, but not at an unreasonable rate considering their daily use/abuse.<br />Despite my initial concerns they do ventilate pretty well considering their material and with a pair of toe-socks it's a non-issue.<br />I purchased my size by the European metric as recommended and they fit like a glove (or maybe even like a foot-glove).<br />If you're shopping for a pair of toe-shoes with a bit more of a traditional aesthetic these are those.	2015-08-08

The style is such that the heel slips a bit when walking (a bit like wearing a clog) but the fit is fine and they are comfortable for wearing all day. The leather is especially soft and required no breaking in.  So, why only three stars?

Maybe I got a defective pair, but whatever the reason I didn't want to keep $200 sandals that need any kind of repair after two wearings.

I am a PreK teacher so I am on my feet all day and would often come home with sore feet.

They're trail runners. The grip is thick rubber, cleated for good grip on mud, dirt, grass, and even snow. Concrete, laminated tile, pavement, and any other style of flooring will wear them down and ruin them. If you're getting these for office use or street running or even for just looking like you trail run then you're wasting $100 that you could've spent on a pair of Jordan's or like 30 Vans.  Pros: •Real nice fit for a NARROW foot •Very comfortable, at least mine were •The insole holds up amazingly after about two years, still not falling apart •The shoe is made like a damn tank, nothing has ruined mine and I put them to work  Cons: •Not incredibly breathable, mine will never smell good again •Holds in water like a sponge  All in all they're amazing and I suggest them to anyone who actually does want to start or already trail runs or even hikes. I take them off trail hiking / running as well as out door sports (soccer, frisbee, etc) and they come in very handy.	2015-08-08

Note: these are not a newer version of the Biom Walk, which has been discontinued. They look a bit like them, but as I discovered, they are Nothing like that amazingly comfortable show.<br /><br />I started noticing that my wonderful Biom Walk 1.1 shoes were starting to show wear, not to the point where I would throw them out, but definitely not looking as spiffy as before. This is after all, after 3 years or so and I wear them every day. The older Biom Walk fit like a glove; for once my narrow feet felt like they had found their perfect match. So, I started thinking I should really get another pair before they disappear or you know, make them &#34;better&#34; and ruin an already perfect thing. But, I never did pick up a second pair, that is until now.<br /><br />This Biom Grip shoe is not made from yak leather, so they're not as soft and form fitting right out of the box. They are also somewhat wider than my old walking shoes and sadly, in my opinion at least, not as cool looking. But worst of all, whereas the older ones felt great right out of the box, (i.e. no break in period needed,) these feel stiff and ill fitting. Strangely, the inserts feel as if the &#34;support&#34; is in all the wrong places: instead of arch support it feels as if there's a random bump in the middle of the shoe right next to the ball. I'm not sure what they were going for here. Now these might conceivably break in, but I don't want to wear them out of the house as then I will own them. So, (as Yoda might say,) return them I will. Note: I was trying to find something that most resembled my walkers. I now believe Ecco has completely discontinued making the shoes I had and these are really a different line.<br /><br />And lesson learned: you can buy just about anything on the Internet, but shoes, not so much. And as for Eccos, the jury is out, but these replacements seem run of the mill, while my old Biom Walk 1.1's were really something special.	2015-08-08

For women, a lot of flat shoes don't provide lots of support so not a huge worry. I noticed my feet did sweat while wearing them. I may wear them to the gym but I wouldn't feel comfortable running in them simply because I would want more support for my feet.  I would recommend them because they are comfortable, it takes a little time to adjust to the 5-toe feel,but I like them.  I would buy another pair if there was better ventilation and more arch support.	2015-08-08

I couldn't have it in my house. After being outside for a week, I hung it in the garage for 2 weeks. Then came a fabreez bath. Now it can stay in the house.

These boots are just the right thing for extremely cold weather.  Twice I was temporarily issued Extreme Cold Weather Boots (the white rubber models) in the Army in Alaska and experienced temperatures of -40 degrees Fahrenheit, yet still stayed comfortably warm.  When I left the military, I bought a pair to keep.  These also go by the names of Vapor Barrier Boots, VB Boots, Mickey Mouse Boots and Bunny Boots.<br /><br />Having semi-stiff rubber shells, they are heavy, clunky, not very flexible and not entirely comfortable to walk in, but they are designed to keep the feet warm and they do that well.  The key is to not 'overdress' with thick socks.  If you do that, you may run the risk of having your feet sweat and sweat is not good in sub-zero temperatures.  Regular wool boot socks is enough to prevent the inside rubber lining from chafing your feet.  For a little added protection, put on a pair of thin polypropelene socks first to wick away any sweat, then the wool socks.<br /><br />There is a valve built into the side to enable the wearer to equalize air temperature if necessary, i.e. in an airplane or riding a very high ski lift.  Because the insulation is supposed to be encapsulated, a reduction in outside air pressure (e.g. ascending in an airplane) can cause the boot to expand; squeezing the feet.  An increase in outside air pressure (e.g. reaching the bottom of the ski hill) can cause the insulation to crush and reduce effectiveness.  Note to the wearer:  Only open the valve when equalizing is necessary.  Leaving it open can allow moisture to get in and render the insulation ineffective.<br /><br />Even if you do not encounter extreme cold, but only sub-freezing temperatures, but with little or no body-heat-generating movement (sitting in a tree stand or duck blind comes to mind), then this is still a good idea.	2015-08-08

I bought a size 7 based on the reviews saying how large these ran. The size 7 wasn't as big on him as I had expected and will have to return/exchange them for a size 8. The size 7 fit him (fit him today but might not fit next week kind of fit) but the toe box of these are pretty narrow so it won't take long before their toes are getting cramped at the front. Down side to these is that their feet have to fit pretty snugly for them to stay on their feet but soon after that point, their toes are hitting the toe box. If you have a toddler who doesn't mind breaking them in for a little while, that may not be an issue for you!	2015-08-08

I also own two other pairs of shoes with wooden soles, which are comfortable. But I'm having a hard time keeping this pair of sandals on my feet for more than 30 minutes of standing.  Walking in them is really ugly. The design of the soles and the awkward arch makes straightening my legs/knees impossible.

My eight year old daughter wanted these because they liked the design on the outside and also needed them for school.

She thought they were really comfortable, warm, and cute.  I loved them because they seemed to look pretty durable but soft at the same time.  They will get a lot of use out of them in rainy Oregon!

Light and sleek they are more narrow and a bit shorter that most other Teva model within the same size - so fit just rigt and take less space in laggage. If you expect usual Teva fit, order 1/2 size up. This model can be fitted in all three places - back, front, middle, yet you have a buckle  to take it on and off, which is a better deal that the usual velcro. Another nice feature is a very thin and quick-dry material. Regular Teva sandals, stay wet for a while after being in water. So, it is the best travel sandals - use in the pool, public showers and baths, beaches and trails - all alike. One pair works for many reasons.	2015-08-08

No need to fear.  They are gorgeous buttery soft leather and super comfortable.  The speckled soles look great to me, not cheap at all.  I'm normally a Keen devotee and have never owned any Tevas (shoes or sandals), so I don't have any other Teva product to judge these against but for dressy-casual boots they are SUPER comfortable even when wearing them all day with a lot of walking and standing.  For me these are 5 stars, without a doubt.  I wear size 7 and on others' advice of these running small I did get a 7.5 and love the fit.  They are comfortable with or without socks and I didn't have any problems getting my foot into the boot so I am not sure what that's about (in a few other reviews here).  I would order the gunsmoke color without hesitation I like my black ones so well.	2015-08-08

I recently bought a pair of the Newport H2 Sandals.  They are very nice sandals in appearance. Recently while walking into a restaurant, I hit a wet spot on the smooth tile floor.  The soles on these IMMEDIATELY BECAME FRICTIONLESS.  Luckily there was a counter next to me that I grabbed onto, otherwise I would have landed on my behind.  I shudder to think what would have happened, if I was walking down a set of wet tile stairs, not holding the hand rail.<br /><br /> Seems like for a pair of $100.00 sandals, KEEN would have had made these sandals with anti skid soles (with a little more safety in mind.)  I'm thinking of returning them or be more cautious when walking on wet, smooth surfaces.	2015-08-08

After buying a pair in size 10.5, and squeezing them on my feet I realized they were WAY too tight.  However, my feet are wider than average but the length was also too short.  My big toe met the very tip of the shoe. Typically my feet are on spot with length in a size 10.5 in shoes but these were too short.  I returned for an 11.  Same story, too tight.  Crossing my fingers I returned for an 11.5 and BAM, perfect fit. If you have wider than average feet, I would recommend getting at least a half size or even a full size larger. Now that I've found the size that fits well (and they feel like socks with a sole), I'm thinking about getting another style...or three.  Great shoes for the price!	2015-08-08

They just recently separated and I was able to use gorilla glue  to reattach the toe of the sole and worked like a charm and they look great with a little bit of black kiwi.

I bought the blue metallic pair and within the first wear (about 8 hours at a sitting desk job in an office) the inner sole just completely fell apart. The material is actually black with a silver overlay on top (probably for the silver pair) and then a second blue metallic overlay on top of that. The blue layer just began to shred and peel off in thin strips and within a few hours most of the sole had turned black and silver.<br /><br />It isn't unwearable because all of the damage thus far has been confined to the sole which isn't terribly noticeable when worn. However, I noticed the uppers also beginning to crease which makes me worried the same thing will happen on top where it will be very noticeable.<br /><br />I gave these two stars because, so far, these still look ok when worn and I get compliments on them every time I wear them. But I thinking these will only last one summer before they are shot.	2015-08-08

I loved these sandals initially. They're very comfortable and I can wear them all day. I have plantar fasciitis and I thought that I would have to be careful wearing these, but I had no problems after wearing them all day. I was so relieved that I thought I had a sandal that was so comfortable and somewhat supportive. So here's the problem, after two months of having them and just occasionally wearing them, the ankle strap broke! I was sooo disappointed. I was walking in them while on vacation in Chicago and the strap just popped open! After my trip I looked both shoes carefully and found that the elastic bands on both shoes were showing through the stretchy material and looks like the other could snap too. I've been considering emailing the manufacturer especially since it's only been two months. But I really liked these shoes. There's no way to wear the broken one without it looking odd. I would have given these sandals 5 stars had it not been for the broken strap! Truly disappointed....	2015-08-08

Well, not only do they look and feel fantastic...and I get tons of compliments, but they also support the proper way of walking barefoot without being barefoot in<br />public😍!<br />I bought the red but they are not red, but a nice orange (which compliments my skin tone nicely)! They also came with a nice mesh carrying case⭐️!<br />If you've never worn 5 Fingers before I strongly recommend visiting the Vibram website to get the correct fit before buying a pair!<br />I ❤️❤️❤️ Vibram 5 Fingers and I look forward to buying my 3rd pair😍.	2015-08-08
US	20993771	R27LQIOXYCM13G	B00J4MWT5E	33548461	Ariat Women's Astor Short Fashion Boot	Shoes	4	3	5	N	Y	Great boots, weird fit.	These are great short boots with very comfortable footbeds just like all Ariats, but the fit is a little odd. I bought them in black because I needed something decent to wear to the office and I LOATHE high heels. I own many pairs of Ariat boots and am familiar with the proper cowboy-boot fit. I was expecting these to be snug across the instep at first, like all cowboy boots, because other reviewers complained about them being tight and I just figured they didn't know how a Western-style boot was supposed to fit. However, they are not snug across the instep at all, but for some reason they are very tight across the top of the lower part of the foot, just behind my toes (that inch or so between the toes and the instep). It's a very odd place for a shoe to be too tight, and I've never had a pair of shoes, cowboy boots or otherwise, with this issue before. The length and width are true to Ariat sizing for me, as they are not narrow anywhere else on the shoe. It's just that that lower part over the top of the foot is strangely tight...<br />Other reviewers said they didn't seem like they would break in, but I disagree. I've had much stiffer leather break in very well, so I'm keeping them because otherwise they're perfect and exactly what I wanted. They're not so tight they're cutting off circulation or anything, and I'm confident that after a bit of wear they'll fit fine. Plus the sale price on my size was incredible. They are lovely little boots and could be worn for many different occasions, so I recommend them as long as the tops don't make them too uncomfortable for you.	2015-08-08

I used this as a travel bag in our recent trip to Italy. I wanted something that would serve as my personal carry-on and could easily accommodate water bottles, brochures, phone, purchases from day trips, iPad, make up, etc. In addition, I wanted to keep a small fabric shoulder bag inside that I could pull out if I didn't want to be bogged down with a large purse. After ordering several bags designed for travel, I went with this option instead. It was much roomier, had compartments inside and out for easy organization but was VERY light weight. I wear mostly black and white, so it gave a nice pop of color. Although, this bag was slightly larger than I wanted,  the compartments and light weight sold me.The only problem: I wanted a cross body bag to prevent theft, and this had only straps to hook onto a stroller. So I used a clip-on strap from a laptop bag and attached it where the stroller straps would have gone. Perfect. I use it now as a &#34;Mimi&#34; bag when I go to babysit my grandchildren. I can stash treats, books, games,etc.  Overall, I am very pleased with this choice.  I loved all the compartments especially when searching for things during the flight, the light weight, and ability to carry two bottles of water during the heat wave we encountered.	2015-08-08

Vionic's liner provides needed support in the arch, and provides cushioning for my aging feet bottoms that have lost much of their own natural cushioning.  I am tall and 68 years old, and don't want to completely give up on shoes with heels.  Once the Vionic liners were in, I feel I can walk and stand at work in these David Tate shoes.  I have a pair of Tate low heel pumps, and I have had to do the same thing with them so that the shoe bottoms are well cushioned for my feet.  I do like the double width that David Tate shoes offer though, so it is worth it for me to make these small adjustments in the liners.  I was lucky to get these shoes in WW, which is hard to find.  So, ladies who might have very wide, problem, or aging feet, don't give up on Tate shoes.  I was able to purchase this pair for $40, which was over $60 less than the original price.	2015-08-08

I was expecting the quality of the Sayoyo  moccasins, which are fine but not great. These are awesome! Beautiful, soft high quality suede, very well made, and sizing not that far off. Expecting the usual moccasins fit 1 complete size too big, (my 7 month old is still growing into Sayoyo size &#34;0-6&#34;), I ordered 0-6 of these too. They actually fit my daughter well now, so I think the 0-6 of these is probably good for most 4-9 month olds.	2015-08-08

The Braddock low fit a little loose going a half size up. Not too loose to send back but definitely require a thicker sock. I have the Braddock mid also and they are a slightly smaller/ more snug fit in the same size(11.5D). I think it might be because there is no Keen Dry lining in the low tops. Very comfortable work boots.	2015-08-08

I was born a man in a mans body and wanted to let other men know that they shouldn't be thrown off by the name of these shades.  The Erika look just as good on dudes as they do on the ladies.  I have a rather large melon so it can be tough to find sunglasses that look right on me but these are perfect.  Stylish, light on the face and all around rad.  I did need to bend the ear pieces back a bit to wrap my ears better, again due to my bulbous noggin, but I often need to make adjustments to my glasses.  So don't fake the funk and tolerate this sexism on Amazon.  These shades are not gender specific and I am tired of living in a world that segregates sunglasses.  Stand up and lets start raging against the machine by buying the Erika!	2015-08-08

I switched over to Saucony Ride 7 for racing shoes--still cushiony, a little lighter, a little firmer sole. Still love these guys, and got a lot of good mileage out of them. Highly recommended for beginner marathoners, people who need lots of cushioning, and people who love the cool colors. I maintain this is a great shoe; everyone just has slightly different running shoe needs. :)	2015-08-08

Right out of the box, 19 miles and 4 hours of rough, rocky steep trails with lots of mud and water crossings. Other than a few hot spots and 1 blister they did great.

Solid Genuine Lambskin Leather Purse	Shoes	2	1	2	N	Y	Cons outweigh the pros	I wanted something made with natural materials (vs. polyester, vinyl, etc.) and would last awhile, so thought lambskin leather would be a good choice. This purse has a strong odor that still hangs around after letting it air out for a few days. It is on the smaller side, which is a plus for me, and with minimal straps. It has 2 pockets with one inner zipper pocket, one inner open pocket and one outer zipper pocket. The photo is misleading - it is black, not navy like I thought it would be (nowhere does it say the color). It is made in China and states it is genuine leather, and I did not see anywhere it said there might be carcinogens in it like another reviewer stated (though you be the judge - the smell is not like any leather I've smelled, it has a chemical component to it). Shipping took 5 business days, not 2-day Prime like it states. Overall, I will either return this or give it away.	2015-08-08

This pair of shoes are retailing for $89 on Florsheim's site, got them for less than half price here.<br /><br />The shoes came slightly damaged - a couple of stretch and scuff marks here and there. They smelt strongly of some sort of solvent, probably glue. I had to air my room for a few hours after.<br /><br />The shoes are also somewhat ugly. They are more square-toed than I would have expected, and the tongue is cut in a jagged pattern. Workmanship is bad - the sewing is frayed throughout the shoe.<br /><br />That said, they are very soft and comfortable though, and conform to your feet easily. I could easily wear them all day.<br /><br />For $30, I would say they are serviceable.	2015-08-08

I can wear them from sunup to sundown and still be comfortable. I have medium to slightly narrow feet and they are snuggly comfortable.  If you have wide feet they may be too tight because the area around the tongue does not open up.  You basically have to slide your foot through the hole in the shoe.  The outer fabric is very lightweight and breathable which makes them perfect for summer.  In the winter I think they will be too breezy and cold to wear.  I am a 6.5 and these fit true to size.	2015-08-08

They aren't the most fashionable shoe but I love that they are made of really soft leather and that the sole is nice and flexible. Most importantly, they are comfortable on my kid and that makes me happy. He absolutely loves these shoes and even sticks his feet out at me when he knows it's time to put them on! And while these were slightly big when we got them (needed 3.5 but they only had 4) my son really had no trouble figuring out how to walk in these. One thing to keep in mind is that they do seem to run wide. I consider my son's foot to be normal (neither thin, nor wide) and in this shoe there is a little bit of room on both sides of his foot. That being said, the extra width doesn't seem to bother him or negatively impact his walking. This shoe would be great for babies with chubby feet.	2015-08-08

So I bought these shoes because I work in a grocery store deli and am on my feet for HOURS at a time in slippery circumstances, however, I wish I had not bought these shoes.  The non-slip part of them is actually great and I had no troubles with that, but they just are not comfortable for any amount of time whatsoever.  They have no foot support at all and while the memory foam in theory sounds great, it is just a thin layer over the sole so it isn't enough padding to make it through any shift. Maybe a four hour one if you have had a couple of days off, but I doubt it.	2015-08-08

These shoes look more &#34;worn&#34; then they appeared in the pic on Amazon.  There were many areas where the color appears faded or even absent (white).  It was so bad, in fact, that I seriously considered returning.  But after zooming in on the picture, I concluded it was a style choice and not a defect.<br /><br />These are nice, comfortable shoes.  But they are narrow and tight if you intend to wear low cut socks over the toes.  Over all I am satisfied, but I would not do a lot of walking in them.	2015-08-08

I've had them for several years now (3+) and they are definitely still my favorite summer shoe! They are so comfortable because they are Crocs, but they are nice enough for me to wear to work and much more comfortable than flip-flops or sandals. I like that they have a slight lift, but not so much that it is uncomfortable. (I hate heels). I am a teacher so I am on my feet a lot during the day. I can wear these all day without getting sore feet, and with the concrete floors at school, that is really an accomplishment. They have held up really nicely over the past few years, and I wear them a LOT. The cork is still in great condition and the leather straps still look great.  The underside of the leather is a plaid cloth, with adds to the comfort of the shoe. However, as time goes on the cotton begins to fray and you may have to cut little strings from the straps. No big deal though.	2015-08-08

Chose this color as.it was $20-$30 less expensive than other colors. I see why. Although the toe strip is red, the color around the foot opening is more like pink or salmon at best. I had to double check that I had indeed ordered a male shoe and yes I did. I real man can rock pink though and I bought them for comfort, not color per se. With the design of the new shoes going up around the arch, I can actually feel that on my right arch, which feels tight. Will keep an eye on that and hopefully it will go away.

I think they were thinking with their pocket books rather than going for quality & customer satisfaction  as they OBVIOUSLY are not using the same artisans as they have in the past (whom delivered a quality product). Now the product probably comes from a child labor camp in China  that pays their workers a dollar a week.	2015-08-08

Actually bought my pair at the Skechers outlet with their BOGO 50% off sale. This was priced at $29.99, so forced myself to pick out a pair of sandals for my daughter just so I could try this out. I have gone through MANY WATER SHOES year AFTER year... from one brand of aquasox to another! What I hated the most with the aquasox was after a few wears the inner sole ALWAYS came out. I actually thought $29.99 was pricey, can't believe they're selling it here for almost 2x the price, but anyway... even my hubby was  saying when are you going to actually where them... WELL... I wear them ALOT! In the pool sometimes and LOVE them at amusement parks! Walked all day in multiple amusement parks and it's like I never even walked! I go from wet to dry --&#62; WONDERFUL!!! If these wear out I will DEFINITELY buy them again! I've use them all day throughout the summer and they look brand new still! Wouldn't pay $50+ but for $30 with another shoe for 1/2 price, MONEY WORTH SPENDING!	2015-08-08

Not a lot of running these days, but sprinting proves easy in these.<br />Finally, these are SUPER LIGHT WEIGHT!  Compared to all of my other Adidas, these feel like the weight of gas station flip-flops!  The ONLY complaint I have is that the laces come untied constantly.<br />They are really, really cool laces, too, but the darn things won't stay tied!  You will need to double-knot or get runner's ties to secure them.<br />Other than that, these are my favorite shoes and I want more in more crazy-loud color combos...I just hope they never stop making these!	2015-08-08

The waterproofing is great and has saved my butt, or feet a few times. I've walked across a shallow river even. If water does get completely over the cuff of the boot, it's still good. The thing is I don't feel any water leak in, even though it will be damp when I take them off later. But it's amazing that if I accidentally submerge the entire boot in water, I can just keep hiking comfortably. It feels as if it didn't happen. I do tie them up tight though and that's comfortable for me.<br /><br />The boots are amazingly comfortable, I never have blisters or ankle pain after my hikes anymore. They grip well to different terrains. My friend had trouble sliding around to get up a steep, hard-packed dirt incline. I could just walk right up it like it was the damn sidewalk. And he liked my boots a whole lot.	2015-08-08

They are at least a full size smaller than other shoes I have that are the same size. I typically wear a 9.5 or 10 US or a 40, 40.5 or 41 European. These are marked 10 US; 42 European and I can barely jam my foot into them.<br /><br />I'm disappointed because they are very good looking shoes and seem to be very well made. I can't comment on arch support because I couldn't actually walk in them. The pictures illustrate the size of these shoes as compared to size 10 Cole Haan and Rollie oxfords.	2015-08-08

I read a review here saying give your feet a week to adjust to these shoes. It is very true, these shoes have arch support not found in many athletic shoes. As someone who has been wearing nothing but flat footed skate shoes for 8 years, I have no arches in my feet, they are flat. However, the longer i have been wearing these shoes, I can feel myself walking more upright, feeling more comfortable on my feet, and the big tongues on these help me out style just about anyone. Great product and I am looking forward to owning these for years.	2015-08-08

I love these! comfortable, cute, go with almost anything-- and my size + color were so cheap! I ended up getting them for $10 (good deal for any shoe, much less Dr. Martens!) because my size was about $30 and I had a gift card. They run a bit big, but I decided they're still worth keeping because of the price. The back of the heel is also a bit stiff, but I don't see that bothering me too much once they're broken in.

For the folks who have challenges finding the right size, another website (which sells Keens, also) has a great approach. There are charts (for women, men and all ages of kids) where you can measure your or your child's foot from heel to toe in inches and match that to the right shoe size. We use this each year to find the best size.  http://www.zappos.com/c/shoe-size-conversion  Apologies that this is a competing site. The other challenge with Keens is that if they get wet, they tend to get smelly over time. If they get wet, stuff them with newspaper over night and they will dry more quickly. Good luck!  &#60;TripAdvisor/IowaMum&#62;	2015-08-08

These are so comfortable provided you get the right size and the arch support, which is great, hits your foot in the right place. I noticed that this style isn't as good for hiking (I was walking across large, wet boulders on a beach) because it doesn't have a back strap. I had to use my feet to try to hold on the shoes while balancing; however, they are excellent for most conditions.	2015-08-08

I have bilateral plantar fasciitis and really hard to find normal looking shoes with adequate arch support. I have these in all 3 colors. I do wish they weren't suede but I do wear them in spring and summer anyway. With impaired feet I have little choice and hard to find cute shoes that I can actually wear all day at work with really good arch support. I've tried other Earthies flat styles but they did not fit well. I am an average size 8.5 and these fit perfectly.	2015-08-08

These shoes are light, 12.7 ounces for the pair on my kitchen scale. if it wasn't for the cushioning and support, you would hardly know you had them on. They're very comfortable without any break-in period. They are the kind of shoes that you can wear for a run or walk and then forget to take off when you get back home. These would also be great shoes to just &#34;wear around&#34; on a daily basis because they are so comfortable.<br /><br />I like the gray and pink color because it looks good with almost any clothing. The gray is also superior to white which shows dirt easily. The reflective material on the &#34;N&#34; on the side of the shoes and on the heel is a nice safety measure and also adds to the attractive design. I'm including a photo for another view or two. My family has owned several pairs of New Balance shoes over the years and they have always held up well and have been among the most comfortable for long distance walking. Two thumbs up for a great pair of shoes!	2015-08-08

I get alot of compliments when I wear these shoes because the &#34;hot pink&#34; which is nearly florescent really stands out and compliments the navy blue color very well.  When I put my feet into these shoes, you can almost hear them give an audible sigh of ecstasy as the memory foam is definitely comfortable.  So why only 3 stars?<br /><br />Durability.  I have been wearing these shoes for just over two months now.  I noticed within the first 3-4 weeks that the sole was already beginning to wear down.  It is especially noticeable under the ball of the foot where the tread is completely gone. (see picture) Also, the pink  color between the sole and navy material is pealing or wearing off.  I don't do alot of walking or hard labor while wearing these shoes.  the only real outside work I've done wearing them is mowing the lawn a couple of times.  They should look nearly new, but they don't.<br /><br />I occasionally exercise inside by walking laps in a large room with low pile carpeted.  I tried to do this wearing these shoes and found that after just 15-20 minutes, the balls of my feet hurt so bad that I had to remove the shoes and continue walking in my socks.  Not only did the memory foam fail to provide any cushioning for my feet, but these shoes actually caused extreme discomfort for this type of use.<br /><br />To sum it up, the shoes are nice looking and comfortable as long as you only wear them for minimal activity.  If you are looking for a shoe that will be comfortable for spending alot of time on your feet or for exorcizing, I would recommend that you find another option.<br /><br />(I did not purchased these shoes from Amazon but from a local store on clearance sale.)<br />(Please note that I do like the Sketchers brand and my previous pair, which did not have memory foam or pretty colors, lasted several years, so it may just be problem with this model.)	2015-08-08

This shoe hugs the foot without being the least bit uncomfortable. In terms of sizing, it is on the roomy side--for most people probably a half size larger than &#34;usual&#34; in length and width. I can see that the leather will ease and conform over time, but don't sense that the shoes will slip or become loose. The footbed is very soft while being supportive. The cognac goes with almost anything and I am considering buying the black as well.  By the way, the distressed factor on the leather and soles is nicely done and only enough to make the shoes look worn, not worn out.	2015-08-08

The wings were droopy because they Velcro to the dress and were too heavy for the material.  She loved the lights on the heels of the shoes but while the shoes fit for size they were so narrow in the heel and being plastic they stuck to her feet causing blisters on her heels.  She was disappointed that the wand did not have any kind of light up feature or sound.  The crown was stuck together plastic beads that again did not impress her as pretty.

Its my first cycling shoe with clips, so I wanted something I could walk short distances in as well. Nice stiff sole, paired with shimano clips that I purchased on Amazon. I would say &#34;fit as expected,&#34; but honestly I expected them to be a little roomy because I planned on wearing thicker socks or 2 pair regular socks. With 2 pair they fit snug but not tight, and I normally wear between a 8.5-9 in athletic shoes. My only complaint is that the laces are quite long and I usually tuck them into the criss-crossed laces so they don't flop around.	2015-08-08

The book should come out in April.  Until then, you should just buy the shoes and experience the majesty for yourself.<br /><br />I usually wear a 9.5, but fit into a 9.  I'm not sure if its because they run a little large, or if each pair comes with a set of cobbler gnomes that fit the shoe ever so perfectly to your own foot.  Judging by the gentle caress of the leather and the excellent arch support, I'd say it was the latter, but the price tells me its the former, as cobbler gnomes can be a bit expensive.	2015-08-08

I am able to wear these all day with heel pain relief..<br />Orthaheel instructions say to wear them for only a couple of hours the first few days. It's good advice. The muscles in my legs were slightly sore from being used in an unfamiliar way, but they did not take long to adjust.<br />I wear a size 9 medium; there is some space in front of my toes. It's not as visible with socks.<br />Arch support is good.  Check out the Orthaheel video: http://www.vionicshoes.com/breakthrough-technology.html<br />I have been wearing mine for two months, and have had a number of compliments. My physicians have approved.<br />Orthaheel technology also promises to help with leg, knee and back pain... I purchased a pair for another family member who has the over-pronation problem described in the video. She loves both the style and comfort.<br /><br />Other reviews reported the straps being too long.... I did not find that on mine. I did appreciate the ability to adjust the straps during a time of foot swelling.<br /><br />I purchased Orthaheel/Vionics slippers the week after ordering these, and have an order in for another, dressier pair of sandals.	2015-08-08

I think it makes a great briefcase for me to use for work & back. It is approximately 15x12x4&#34; in size which is perfect for transporting my work documents, my Kindle tablet and my phone all in one convenient space with room to spare for pens and calculator, etc. It is ideal for a laptop because I have let my daughter use it for when she has projects at a friend's house and needs to transport her laptop safely back and forth to college.

However this style sizing seems to be off from the other crocs we own. The nine is too small in length yet the ten is to large. I am a solid nine in all footwear but had to gift this to my sister who wears a 8.5 and it fit her perfectly. This is a time when half sixes by crocs would be so handy. The ten just slips off my feet too easily. This does seem to geared toward a medium wide foot. Narrow width ladies will likely find it too big as it does stretch but that give is wonderful for my sister who's feet Swell badly  These are the first wedge heels she had been able to wear in a long time with her fibromyalgia and Lupus related condition.	2015-08-08

I did not pay enough attention to the reviews already posted.  First, it seems well established now that most shoes made anywhere are getting narrower for the given size, and this is especially true for lightweight shoes.  So this 2E, even though &#34;wide&#34;, is pretty much like standard width used to be and therefore much to tight for me.  Second, while it is advertised as a supportive cushion shoe, it says &#34;light weight&#34; in the in the name, and lightweight just does not equate to great support and cushion.  All that said, they look great, seem to be built well, are definitely light and perform well.  If considering, keep width in mind, and realize these are more of a performance, weight-optimized shoe.  If you need wide cushion, look elsewhere (I ended up getting NB 1005's and love them).	2015-08-08

However, after exhausting all efforts to find this style of shoe in the local environment, it became necessary to order on-line. These shoes are quite satisfactory. They provide the width that I require, but the length is somewhat over-done, which means that I must lace them up nice and tight. They are wearable and do not cause any problems such as blisters...etc, but there is a slight audible &#34;popping&#34; sound when walking, due to the slight &#34;over-size&#34;.	2015-08-08

I loved the style of these boots and they fit just as expected but they caused me so much pain that I could barely walk in them by the end if the one day I wore them.  I think it had to do with the point at which shoe slants upward just past the ball of my foot.  It caused too much pressure near the front if my arch.  I gave these boots to a friend who's wears the same size I do, and she has no difficulty wearing them at all so it could just be the shape and arch if my feet specifically.

Without the support of the New Balance MX857 shoes and these New Balance insoles I would have trouble walking and standing for any length of time so I guess  I will continue to buy.	2015-08-08

Normally I wear them nearly out and replace them with a new pair. The size, fit, and quality of the previous ones I've had were great. The recent pair I purchased from Amazon had quality issues, though. The main problem was with the top piping (edging). The right shoe's was turning down toward the foot and cut into my heel very badly after only about an hour of wear. It was very rough on both shoes and the shoes did not fit as well as before. Now I'm afraid to order them as apposed to trying and buying them in person.	2015-08-08

I chose the gray and orange, looks nice!  Update:  Now that I've had these for a few months I decided to review more about performance. I've been more active in my gym lately and use these while working out. I also hit the treadmill around 3 times a week. I won't use any of my other sneakers now that I've got these.   I've tried to use others because I didn't want to wear these out. But they are just so comfortable! I wanted to just use them sparingly because I love the looks, but my feet and knees feel so much better after my workout with these.   I do have a narrow foot and maybe that's the best foot type for these. Some bad reviews will come with all shoes since everyone has different feet. All I can say is they've been great for me. A few months of use and still no signs of wear and tear.	2015-08-08

The insoles appear to be made from qualitty materials.  The metatarsal support took a little getting used to.  When I first started using these I could wear them for a couple of hours before the metatarsal support wouls`d cause a hot spot on my feet but that abated after a few days.  Now II can comfortably wear these all day long.<br /><br />I bought these insoles because I had Morton's Neuroma cause from running.  After taking a three week break from running and wearin these insoles, I would estimate that my neuroma symptoms have lessened by about 80 to 90%.  When using these insoles I do not notice any of the symptoms at all.<br /><br />Yesterday, I ran 4.5 miles for the first time using these insoles.  I experienced not foot pain and the neuroma symptoms did not increase.<br /><br />I have ordered two more pairs of these insoles to wearing in my work shoes and casual shoes.

Very cute, unique frame, and do great for driving in the sun!	I love these sunglasses. I have a pair that looks similar to these and I was pretty happy with it, until I got these sunglasses in my mail and realized what I've been missing out on.<br /><br />First of all, they look fantastic. I got the burgundy frame. I love that the color is not bright or in your face, but you can definitely see it at certain angles and in certain light. The design also gives these frames a unique and attractive look. The glasses themselves are not too big and not too small (I hate large sunglasses, but small ones tend to be pretty useless if you're trying to drive).<br /><br />Second, they do an amazing job in blocking out the sun. I never knew what a big difference polarized lenses make in comparison to your regular set. I get to keep all of the vibrant colors of the outside (unlike the muted/darkened colors that result with other glasses), while I get better sun block. I haven't had to squint while driving in bright sun, especially at sundown.<br /><br />Finally, they don't seem to get as dirty as my other glasses do. I'm not sure what's contributing to this. I tend to have oily skin, so I know that sometimes my other glasses pick up the oiliness from my cheeks, but I haven't had this issue with these glasses. I also don't have to clean them as frequently and when I do clean them, they look almost brand new without any special liquid cleaner!<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed and very happy with this purchase. I received these glasses at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-08
US	34215816	R3B3WLJO7Y3FEV	B00E7X89V8	216292658	Sanita Women's Blaire Mule	Shoes	5	1	1	N	N	GIVE THESE A CHANCE!	It is funny to read through all the &#34;shoe trauma&#34; about these clogs. I have a small size six foot and my regular size 36 clogs fit perfectly. Perhaps those of you that got clogs that were way too big should try again and the next pair will fit, because these actually fit better than some of the Danskos I have. After all I read I was surprised how well they fit, how comfortable they are and that my straps haven't fallen off! The issue about the velcro, which is wreaking such havoc, can be solved in a few ways. First, remember that the strap is not meant to hold tightly around your foot; if you have the straps too tight your velcro is more likely to come popping off. The straps must be a little loose so that there isn't much tension on them as you lift you foot forward. Your heel will rise out of the back of the clog as you walk- this is the traditional way most Danskos and Sanita clogs are meant to be. But if you already have the straps a little loose and they are popping off, find your ideal spot for the straps to be in and have them permanently attached by a shoe repair place, or better yet, do what another buyer did and hot glue the velcro together. Super glue will also do the trick. I use it for everything. Don't give up on these so soon. They are more flattering than the Dankso Marcelle, Margrete, Marah or Harlow. My foot fills this clog better than the other Maryjanes. And the fit really lengthens my legs- I can't even say why that is , but that's a nice unexpected bonus! I bought the red shoes because they were only $29. I'm not a fan of bright red though, so then I bought some brown shoe dye and now, voila, I have a gorgeous pair of medium brown maryjanes clogs. Get these while they are still available!	2015-08-08

Red is his favorite color, and these are RED, plus he loves the red, white, and blue striped lining. I ordered them a touch large to make sure they would fit for kindergarten this fall, and the padded heel and ankle means we can cinch the velcro strap tighter to help keep them from sliding on his heel and it's still really comfortable. The main reason for ordering this particular pair is the rubber side sole and toe cap-- my son wears through the inside toe of his shoes from scootering and braking, and we're hoping these last longer than his last much more expensive pair! As with all See Kai Run, they seem to be well-made. Time will tell if the rubber holds up to his extra abuse.<br /><br />They're also adorable-- ahem, handsome and cool on him. Satisfies his need for color and my desire for retro-style cuteness! Win-win.	2015-08-08

Because of diabetes, my feet feel anything like they used to feel.<br />So, I needed a shoe / sandal that I can adjust in several ways, since my feet might be swollen more or less.<br />These Sandals absolutely meet this requirement.<br />I also was surprised on how comfortable they feel. (if I can call it that, people with nerve pain do know what I mean)<br />The shock absorber, is also very welcome.<br />All over, they are nice to wear because of their lightweight.<br />About durability, I can't tell yet, since my left foot tends to wear the shoe on the outside. (Not just the sole, the whole thing goes sour)<br />This usually happens about 6 month later!	2015-08-08

Reebok quit making them for a few years, and during that time, ive had nothing but pain in my feet. I could tell the difference after one day of work. Like standing on clouds.( i stand for a 12 hr shift and walk on concrete floors all day. ) as before, my foot measures to be a 9. However ive always found the 8.5 wide to be the most comfortable for me.	2015-08-08

I thought that they were well made and expensive per our usual shoe budget. She did not care for the jeweled ladybug on the top. They fit her size 7M foot perfectly. They were very comfortable on her feet. She detests flats that rub the top of her heel at her ankle and these did not hit her there at all.<br /><br />The shoes are not smooth leather; rather, they are like a soft fabric outside with a leather lining inside. They don't have an raised instep support area so I cannot tell if they provide high instep support but I would hazard a guess that they do not.<br /><br />I cannot attest to wear or durability since she tried them on and wore them inside.	2015-08-08

This is my second pair of these shoes, but first pair of the linen ones.  The first pair is wax canvas.  This shoe is so much heavier than the wax canvas...but by no means HEAVY.<br /><br />The wear of these shoes is INCREDIBLE!  So comfy - like slippers with SUPPORT & PIZAZZ!  I get a lot of second looks, like people curious but afraid to say anything!<br /><br />There is one struggle with these shoes; but I'm not sure what would fix it (and it's not enough to prevent me from buying more of these in the future).  Putting them on is not so easy because the upper portion of the shoe does not slide easily over the top of the foot.  After you get used to putting them on, the fit afterward is worth it!<br /><br />Also, I can't speak to the wear of these shoes because I have two pairs, along with several other pairs of shoes and they get worn maybe once or twice a week.	2015-08-08

These are adorable boots for kids - especially if they're crazy about firemen and firetrucks like mine. I ordered them in a size 2 expecting them to be a bit on the small side (my 7yo currently wears a size 1) but they were big like I'd expect a 2 to be, so I would say these are true to size. What I found most interesting about them is that there's a nylon portion at the top with a drawstring to help keep water out - this portion will get damp, but his socks stayed dry. There's easily enough room inside the top of the boot to stuff his pant legs down in there. They seem very well made and durable. He wore them for about 2 hours of puddle jumping, bike riding and random child's play after an afternoon storm and had no complaints except that I made him come in. I received these boots at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-08

They were adorable and extremely comfortable. So I decided to try to find some Sanuk flats that I could also wear to work and school. All my Sanuk sandals are a size 9, which is the size I normally take, and fit perfectly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these run very large. I definitely agree with other reviewers that they need a half size. I put these on and walked less than two blocks from my house and already had blisters on the back of my heels. So that was in total about 4-6 minutes of wear before the back of my heels were rubbed raw. As said in other reviews, since they run wide and large they slide on and off of your foot which causes the chaffing. The back of the heel is also molded very poorly, the fabric curves inward so even if you were to find a proper fit width/length wise, it would still inevitably rub.<br /><br />On a side note, the color shown on the white and black pair is a bit misleading. In person, they are white and black so much as they are a yellow beige and black. Not a huge deal, but worth noting if you are particular about color.<br /><br />Overall, this was a big disappointment as the sizing is way off and the heel is constructed badly.	2015-08-08

They have excellent support for someone that needs it badly.  I use these along with the New Balance Motion Control inserts to supply the maximum support.  I don't think I could walk or stand for any length of time without them.  I also like that they come in the black color so they can be used in all but the dressiest occasions.  Before I happened on these heavy duty cross-trainers years ago I always had trouble with my shoes wearing out very quickly and becoming run-over especially with any type of athletic shoe.  New Balance constantly changes the model number on the shoes so it can be hard to figure out sometimes which one replaces the previous model but I have followed the evolution of this model for years.  It is the best, longest lasting shoe I have found.	2015-08-08

These are amazing! Apart from the style being adorable, the quality is superb with soft leather inner and an outer that appears to be made of suede, though I'm not positive. (I bought the red pair.) I chose size 5 for my 18 month old - she's beginning to grow out of her 4 - 4 1/2 shoes - and these are perfect as they have a little room for growth. I love that they can be worn in Summer and also going into Fall and early Winter, I can see her now sporting them with tights.

US	12696673	R2VIAN2JSW2QGO	B000AOEU2K	938695839	Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance - Gamecube	Video Games	5	5	5	N	Y	One of the Greatest Gems of the Gamecube (Or Any System)	I have played many video games from many different genres and systems over the years,  and I have to say that despite its age Fire Emblem Path of Radiance ranks among my favorite games of all time.  Here's why:<br /><br />Gameplay - First of all, the gameplay.  Like other FE games, it is a turn-based strategy game where you direct your characters to carry out a wide variety of actions.  T  After all your characters have moved, it's the enemy's turn, and so it goes until the conditions of the chapter are met.  It's not about who has the biggest sword and who can hack who to pieces the quickest by mashing buttons, it's about evaluating the your characters strengths and weaknesses(which vary based on their class, of which there are many in PoR) of both your characters and your opponents and forming a strategy based around them.  But you have to be careful though because if a character dies then they are gone forever, and you have to reset and start the chapter over if you want them back.  But to me that just adds to the depth of the game because you actually have to think about what you're doing  and when you succeed in a mission you feel a real sense of accomplishment that will have you hooked after a few chapters.<br /><br />Characters/Storyline - To me these are the most important elements in a game, and it is here that Path of Radiance shines.  The characters in this game are some of the most interesting and likable that I have ever come across in a video game.  Although there are a few stereotypes (mainly among the villains), most of the main characters have depth and develop emotionally throughout the course of the game, and you really come to care about them and want them to succeed.  And the support conversations, which the Fire Emblem series is known for, only adds to this development.  These support conversations range from touching and emotional to downright hilarious. As for the storyline, it starts out simple but unfolds nicely as the game proceeds withoutbecoming too convoluted and really pulls you in.  Many important themes are touched on, including prejudice, the cost of war, and racism.  I have played the game several times, and each time I always pick up on something new.<br /><br />Replay Value - to  me, this is high.  After beating the game you have  the option test yourself with a higher difficulty level.  Furthermore, there are so many characters and since support conversations are limited to a certain number per character that it is fun to test out new combinations to see how they work out and what different characters say to each other.  Also, after beating the game once, you have the chance to alter your level ups in the form of special bands, which adds another interesting facet to the gameplay.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />Graphics - Those obsessed with graphics might find those in PoR a little dated but I personally found them to be quite good, especially for a gamecube title.<br /><br />Difficulty - Also, some might find the learning curve a little steep, as is the case with many FE games. However, there are varying levels of difficulty, including an easy mode for those new to FE games.  This allows newcomers to get acclimated to the game and enjoy its rich story while guiding you through the intricacies of the combat system(without overwhelming you). So if you're willing to invest the time, you'll be amply rewarded with an amazing gaming experience.<br /><br />Length -  And lastly, the game is too short. You can finish it in around thirty hours and it will leave you craving more (which is where the replay value kicks in).<br /><br />So if you've played FE Awakening and are looking for another amazing Fire Emblem title, or are just searching for a great game to play, look no further.  From the addictive gameplay to the memorable characters, Fire Emblem Path of Radiance is a world you will enjoy becoming immersed in and that will stay with you long after you finish it.  It may be expensive, but it's worth it.  Heck, if mine ever broke or malfunctioned, I would gladly pay the steep prices to get a new one. It's that good.	2015-08-08

I'm a big fan of the AC series and I have found far more enjoyment from this game in the series than AC: Unity.  The only downside is it is on last gen consoles, even though it was built on the AC4 engine, which can run on current gen consoles, leaving it with some FPS issues as well as some graphical degradation.<br /><br />Combining game elements from AC3 & AC4, the game feels like an extension of AC4, but with the opportunity for more land based exploration in the River Valley (similar to the massive frontier in AC3).  The seasonal effects from AC3, summer & winter, are now a permanent attachment to the landscape depending on your latitude in the game.  The ship battles remain an integral part of the game with some minor improvements, such as the ability to quickly look behind you, laying a river of fire behind your ship, and the ability to charge into other ships with a ram that is available early in the game.  Even the current timeline puzzles in the Abstergo complex seem a bit more fun than the ones in AC4.<br /><br />The characters and storyline are far more interesting than most of the other AC titles, albeit shorter with only 6 sequences; however, the number of side quests and objectives in the game can add hours of gameplay beyond the story.  Unfortunately most of the side objectives & quests are filler, time-sinks adding relatively little to the story and are traditionally the part of AC that has you running around to unlock new weapons & armor, which has little purpose if you've completed the game other than to fulfill the completionist.	2015-08-08

I've had turtle beach sets,tritons 720 and axpro(decent product) then I bought the astro a40s(great sound) by far one of the best headsets I've been able to use my only problem was the build quality,my two year old lightly dropped them onto the carpet and a chunk if plastic came off($300 only to have break in 5 months smh)if you can find the Astros for a good price then go with those but if you're on a budget..the Sony gold wireless headset is the way to go..the sound when you download the companion app is SUPERB... You can tweet the mid treble and bass..the bass isn't too crazy but for $100 bucks it is better than a lot of turtle beach sets like the 500p stealth too many issues to name...if you need &#34;quality&#34; sets for a good price I recommend you give these a try...I was highly skeptical reading these reviews but now I know why they have high ratings...my only complaint would probably the same as the astro a40s..build quality but these seem like they can take a few more falls than the a40s...great headset especially with the companion app I was surprised my first time putting them on(oh yeah they're a light headset that won't cause headaches like the trittons I had before)so you'll be able to play longer..battery life is decent I would recommend buying a longer USB 3.0 to charge while you play...once again for $100 there's nothing better..	2015-08-08

I purchased this game to play on my 90minute lunch breaks, and I was specifically looking for a game with some content.  So far I'm about 6 hours in and it seems there is much more content to go and due to the rpg nature you could probably enjoy a second play-through as well. The game seems to be enjoyable and playable if you play it laid back or if you want to really min-max.  Another big selling point for me was being able to save often since I have a hard cut-off when I have to go back into work from lunch and it's nice being able to save anytime during the level(a great option for a handheld game like this.)  I might update the review later as I get more into the content, but as of right now the game is top-notch.	2015-08-08

These thumbsticks are terrible. Cheap plastic molds of the xbox one sticks. Not even good molds. The crosshatch pattern of the grip grooves on the sides look aweful. They also make cheap plastic clicking noises when you flick the stick. They sent me white rubber caps covers to put ontop... Probably because they know these suck.They just came in today and I'm about to lookup how to get a refund. It sucks because I paid more for the one day shipping than for the sticks. I'll likely be waiting weeks for a refund and for shipping of a better product from a different vendor. Save yourself the trouble and look for OEM xbox one sticks.

Been using it and here's how the controller feels: It's light compared to a PS3 controller. It takes AA batteries the small ones. It feels a little cheap at first maybe it needs to be worn in, but it looks good and the button placement is nice. At first, the buttons don't respond to a tap you really have to push them hard. The joysticks aren't as sensitive as the original controller. for example when you push the joystick diagonally it doesn't register very well, it's not as nice as the regular joysticks. There isn't any button lag though for being wireless, it has a quick response. No major problems so far. For the price I got it (about $13) it is decent for being a wireless controller.	2015-08-08

Everything is a lot better compared to the original batch and they come pre-loaded with the latest firmware date.  It still has some faults that were not corrected/probably won't be corrected - The controller that comes with it is garbage. You should only use your this controller to test out the system and/or as a last resort. - Built in latency. The Retron 5 uses emulation to play your games, so there will always be added latency. Not to mention your playing on a HDTV that most likely has a higher input latency then your old CRTV. The higher your TV response time is, the worst the case will be here. - No N64 support, Atari Jaguar etc. There are still quite a lot of cart based systems out there that I wish were supported. However, Hyperkin is bringing out a Game Gear adapter is the future that will be sold separately for the Retron 5. No price point was given at the time of this review. - It's a giant piece of plastic. Don't expect original XBox bulletproof hardware here. - Various titles are not compatible, the list is rather small but they are still there. You'll never have 100% compatibility through emulation. For the record all of my titles worked but this may be a issue for other people. - Genesis/SNES Deathgrip slots - While the revision made things a lot &#34;looser&#34; the Genesis slot still feels hard to pull in/out. I don't think Hyperkin is going to do any further revisions of the Retron 5 at this point.  Those are all the negatives I can think of. If you can deal with the list of negatives then I think you'll be fine with your purchase. The system does It's job and is about as close as a replacement for all your older systems that you'll find on the market right now. If you want to play all your old cart based games on a HDTV for a relatively low price point this would be your best option right now. If you have more money the other option would be to buy XRGB3 or some sort of upscaler that will most likely cost you 3x-4+ the price of the RetroN 5.	2015-08-08

After spending over 50+ hours finishing the game, I have to say it wasn’t as awesome as the first but was equally just as addicting.<br /><br />DanganRonpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a mystery visual novel, where each chapter ends with a trial.  Think of Ace Attorney meets Hunger Games.  The game takes place right after DanganRonpa.  Sixteen students, who were attending Hope Peak’s Academy, suddenly found themselves on a school trip to a tropical island.  It was supposed to be a relaxing trip until Monokuma takes over the island, and resurrect the killing game.  Like the previous game, each chapter lasts about 5-6 hours.  Each chapter revolves around 1 case.  The main plot is not revealed until the very end, so you don’t really know the truth until the final chapter.  I will admit the plot was slow to build but the ending was soooo worth it.  The last chapter will really grab you and it was so hard to put the Vita down.<br /><br />Now come to the puzzle and fun part.  The trials are the real time stealers here.  I have not officially checked the time since I get too engrossed to notice, but the trial themselves takes about 3-4 hours to complete.  I like to note I played the game in “Kind” mode.  So, it was not as harsh as “mean” mode.  This is definitely much harder than the first game.  Similar to Ace Attorney trials for me.  I mean in regards to the logic.  It wasn’t as obvious as the first game.  Plus, as the game progressed, the harder the trials got.  I mean, a lot.  So, I had to consult a walkthrough a few times.  My final grades were always ‘B’.  In any case, if you make a mistake, you can always redo it.  The only thing it effects is your final grade, but it’s not a huge deal.  The arguments are timed so you can’t spend time thinking it over.  Luckily, you can pretty much save at any time except during the prologue.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the characters.  They were just bit annoying and such crybabies.  All the characters have at one time or another has been crying.  The game lacked character development.  Nagito, Chiaki and Hajime were the only ones to really get any real development.  However, I could care less about them since we really don’t get a chance to get emotionally invested in them.  And the deaths didn’t fill me with dread as I expected.<br /><br />For the technical, here is a quick summary.  There is no lag.  Transition from room to room is pretty seamless.  Navigation was easy to use.  I only used the English dialogue, so I can’t comment on the Japanese.  But I usually find the Japanese voice acting to be awesome in any game.  Anyway, the English voice acting was good and definitely matches well with each character.  I can’t comment on translation as well. Graphic-wise, some parts were as good as the first and some weren’t.  The design is lighter, which matches the mood of the island.  But I missed the more grittier side.<br /><br />After the game, Island Mode is unlocked.  In this mode, it’s a what-if game where Usami defeated Monokuma from the outset.  This is where you can get a trophy and get the rest of the hope fragments.  I will tell you, this is SUPER tedious.  It took me about 15 hours.  I was hoping for something cool but it was eh.  I could’ve lived without playing it.  There is a novel, IF, that is unlocked as well.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the first one, you have to get this game.  You will love it.  You get your money’s worth and the gameplay is very addictive.  If you are not a visual novel or puzzle gamer, this is not for you.  I cannot wait for Despair Girls and the 3rd installment.  Again, there is foul language and gruesome deaths for parents buying for children.  In the end, loved the game.were just bit annoying and such crybabies.

I am going to give you guys a TRUE review of this game and hopefully I do not get hate for this review. I have played many JRPGs and this games COMPLETELY matches a JRPG. If you TRULY love JRPGs then BUY this game, I guarantee that you will LOVE it. I, on the other hand love the game!!! It has VERY CREATIVE and COLORFUL graphics NOT GREAT graphics. I seen on another review that this game had horrible graphics and they compared this game to zelda, uncharted, and some other NON NON NON NON NON NON JRPGs....... This game is made to have lower quality graphics, but they look and feel better than what zelda or uncharted has to offer. I am not going to review the story or gameplay because you can just go LOOK IT UP OR WATCH VIDEOS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME!!  I give this game a solid 4/5. it is not a perfect 5 stars because I have played better JRPGs. But if you love JRPGs then BUY this game. It is a MUST have for your collection. If you are one of those (waaaaa!!! the graphics are too corny and unrealistic for me to be wasting my time playing) then you should not have bought this game and you should not have put a negative review towards this game. The hype on this game is legit. It is a WONDERFUL JRPG. But when you start comparing it to games like Skyrim, Persona, Uncharted, Zelda..... it does make this game look bad. All of those other games are DIFFERENT STYLED GAMES!!!!! They were intended to have better graphics with less color variations, while Wrath of The White Witch is intended to have lesser quality graphics but with extreme variation in colors. Comparing this game to Uncharted is like comparing Mortal Kombat X to Mario Party....... TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STYLED GAMES!!!!!! Hopefully you wonderful people have read this review and will buy this game lol I honestly recommend it for everyone to try. This game is totally amazing!! and I recommend it to all gamers!!!!!!	2015-08-08

Great controller, however there are some drawbacks to take into account.<br />This controller as reletively easy to put together granted the fact you have done it before. This controller doesn't come with those awesome bonus screws it says it does so make sure to keep an eye on the ones you already have! The analog sticks are good quality but a little to soft for the average gamer. Also im not sure if this happened to all the kits but almost every button i got had this sticky residue on it... Anyway it feels good, great grip, and there are no pinch points that i have noticed yet.<br />All arround this is an amazing shell, and let's face it looks pretty damn cool as well.<br />P.S. It comes with an awesome bracelet! I love when companies do this it is like that little cherry on top to go with your amazing product.	2015-08-08

My main complaint would be that it's not very stable. Your PS4 is just sitting there. It's not snug or locked in place at all, unless you count the USB plug, but it's wired so it provides no extra stability. At best it will just bring the whole stand down with the PS4 if it falls off your desk.<br /><br />The charging docks are neat, and the fans might help (I don't know enough about the PS4's cooling to know if the position they're in is effective).	2015-08-08

So far I've played A Magical Melody, A New Beginning, Island of Happiness, and now Tale of Two Towns. I love all of them, but I've really enjoyed this one.  I love the fact that the characters walk places instead of just teleporting, the horse and cart feature, and practically everything else.<br />Probably my only complaints are the fact that:<br />1) You can only save when you go to bed. (I really dislike this since I'm the type who likes to save a lot)<br />2)  Instead of multiple seeds only one crop grows from each seed-pack<br />3) The store inventories are random. It was annoying when I was looking for Chili Peppers in Raul/Diego's stores and couldn't find any for about two weeks.<br /><br />That's about it; all together I strongly recommend this game. I love being able to travel between two towns and also there are panda's!  Plus the characters are all really nice and interesting.	2015-08-08

This is a remake of Etrian Odyssey 2, originally on the Nintendo DS. Untold stays true to the gameplay of the original, while adding a slew of new accessibility features and new content, making the game more enjoyable and approachable for all levels of players. In addition, many of the character classes have received tweaks and improvements over their originals. As a result, customizing, developing, and doing battle with your party is more interesting, fun, and rewarding.<br /><br />As always with the Etrian Odyssey series, the music is excellent and the battles require a degree of strategy.<br /><br />All in all, Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold is a classic dungeon crawler RPG that's been given a mirror coat of polish and tricked out with a huge array of accessibility and quality of life features. I'd recommend this title to anyone who likes JRPGs, dungeon crawlers, strategy games, or just any game that permits a high degree of player customization.	2015-08-08

The black glossy hard plastic and aluminium hot pink finish on the Wii U Gamepad Case gives my controller a great modern look that's unique and stylish, without sacrificing functionality.<br /><br />Once opened, it's a simple as setting your controller in the bottom of the case, lining up the top and snapping the edge closed.  The case snaps together just about everywhere the two halves meet, making a very solid fit around your controller. You don't need to worry about the extra bulk of some cases, the Wii U Gamepad Case is barely noticeable. Every button, control stick and port has a clean, unobstructed opening and the screen is completely accessible for your touchscreen needs.  Game on.  I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-08

She doesn't care what the game is and just gets so excited to try anything new. She has watched all the Shrek movies and loves them so I knew she would love to try out this PC game. This game did take quite a while to download but that wasn't really surprising to me.<br /><br />The game really tells the story as you play which makes it almost like watch the movie while playing the game. This game is a lot of fun as you travel around collect money and fight bad guys. You also are able to switch characters between Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Puss in Boots and each character has different special abilities. She is only 7 and was able to easily play this game and follow the on screen instructions by herself.<br /><br />The one downside is that there are a lot of different buttons on the keyboard that you have to use to play the game. Some control switching characters, some control moving, and some control the characters special abilities and attacks. After you play the game for a while the buttons become easier and easier to remember which does what but it does take some time to get used to. You will definitely want to keep the instruction book close which tells you what all the buttons do in case you forget. This game is definitely fun for all ages and is a really great price.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-08

By now you already know the game but what I didn't know was that if you do not have a Microsoft Certified hard drive in your 360 then the game will not boot since it is an original Xbox game. I got a 3rd party hard drive and it did not automatically boot.<br /><br />The issue is that there there is what's known as &#34;Partition 2&#34; on the certified hard drives that is not loaded onto the 3rd party drives. What I had to do was a little bit of software loading onto the hard drive to get the game to boot.<br /><br />The instructions that I followed are here: http://digiex.net/downloads/download-center-2-0/xbox-360-content/apps-pc/4897-xbox-360-partition-2-download-xbox-1-emulator.html<br /><br />Admittedly it will take a bit of doing to get it to run, but if you're into old school games and are just getting around to buying a 360 and bought a 3rd party hard drive this will fix your issues.	2015-08-08

It's a massive game, ported over decently to a handheld system, it has some issues, but patches have helped it to run much smoother. I haven't had very many issues with bugs, I have only had it crash once, there are a few parts of the game where there is noticeable frame rate drop, but it is by no means unplayable. Now that all the bad is out of the way, just take a moment to think about how much content is in this game, and consider the fact that it all works relatively well. It may not be the absolute best way to enjoy this game, but you can absolutely enjoy it. It is still a fun game, it handles surprisingly well, better than I expected at least, i have played the game before and I loved it then, and I enjoyed this time just as much.	2015-08-08

This has been a long time in the coming. I was a Day One adopter and couldn't be happier. The system got off to let's call it a rough start but at this point, that's water under the bridge. Microsoft has done what they needed to do.<br />  Let's talk Games. Gaming wise, there's not much you will miss here other than the 1st party Sony title (Uncharted, Last of Us, KillZone, etc..) which are great games but Microsoft has a lot of great exclusives also (Halo, Gears of War, Crackdown, etc...). However, 90+ (%) of the games out there are available on both platforms. I happen to own both and I'm glad to say whichever way you go, you will not be disappointed. At the time of this posting, you would of gone through &#34;Resolutiongate&#34; and the final verdict is &#34;YES, the Xbox One can do 1080P (30/60). The PS4 from the start was easier to get there but if you look at the titles being released now, you can see that the developers are achieving matched performance. I'm not sure what difference DX12 will have on the Xbox One but there should be at least a slight performance boost there, not that it's even needed. Not, to just off topic but this &#34;Resolutiongate&#34; fiasco was silly from the start.<br />  Let's talk Apps. From the start, the Xbox One won in this category, Microsoft is a software company at the heart so this was to be expected. In either case, I would say they are really close in this category now but Microsoft still has Sony beat here with more Apps and quicker releases. I expect this trend to continue but you just never know. What I find most useful are the video apps (YouTube, HBO, Netflix and the newly released Media player with streaming support). I have also been know to show off family photos using the Xbox Media Payer App but not too often. The Xbox One OS is a 3 in 1 OS and very tightly coded to Windows 10 so you never know what else might come later. With the launch of Windows 10, we just got the ability to stream to your PC which works greatbut honestly, the reverse is an even more enticing feature (I hear it might be coming). If you game on the PC, some game will now support cross buy, so you buy it once and play where it suit you. There is tons to talk about here, Game  DVR, The OneGuide, TV DVR for Europe, I could go on forever but just trust me, you won't be disappointed here.<br />  Let talk Kinect. This will be short but sweet. Do I use it....Yes. Do I love it.....Yes. I do want more from it though and I expect more when Cortana comes to Xbox One in November. This was a great add-on that I feel did not get a fair start due to concerns in regards to privacy and previous execution of similar technologies in games. I hope Microsoft does not kill it or reduce it's functionality because what could spawn especially in conjunction with HoloLens could be great. By the way, the voice recognition is amazing when done right (ex: Xbox One navigation Dead Rising and Ryse immediately come to mind).<br />  There's a lot more that I could add but this has been a pretty long review. If you've come this far, thanks for sticking with me.  As a Xbox One and PS4 owner, I am giving the Xbox One 5 stars. I truly believe it deserves it, I'm not being an Xbot/Ms fanboy as a lot of people like to claim, just giving credit where it is due. I'll write my PS4 review soon but here's a preview, 5 stars....for different reasons. You might want to reason just to find out why and make your decision on the best console for you that way.<br /><br />P.S. If you owned an Xbox 360 and loved it. Get the Xbox One	2015-08-08

The packaging is well done	My Madcatz TE2 Arcade stick just arrived and i ordered it 4 days ago, arrival time said 8-7-15 to 8-11-15, and today is the 7th so thats pretty good. The packaging is well done,its pretty much like your opening another ps4 box, but instead its just the arcade stick. I love this Arcade stick and knowing that i can mod it but, i give it 4 stars because the glass top layer that goes over the picture on the arcade stick has some Rainbow colored film and its not any liquid or anything its like a new screen protector you put on your phone screen so when you push on it the rainbow look moves around. But it is hard to notice if your not the one holding it, If its not in your lap you cant see it. I think once you do your own modding to it that will change. As of durability it seems pretty heavy and nothing to loose other then the glass top, it wont come off unless i move it but it moves slightly up and down under the border. And it is hollow on the inside because of the compartment it has so for how heavy it is its pretty good.	2015-08-08

Perhaps it's the expectation, but Diablo 3 is watered down version of Diablo 2 with higher resolutions that inhibits smooth game play on older computers (though I guess it's not Blizzards fault my hardware is outdated) and a ambitious but failing general chat system that actually discourage player to player interaction. PvP does not reward players for winning, players can view each other's gear via their profile. Disappointing in almost all aspects, even the storyline.	2015-08-08

Overall, this is a very solid product for a very very reasonable price- at least when compared to other similar products. I originally ordered this product when I first began playing games such as Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen, when a keyboard and mouse just wouldn't cut it. Everything worked well out of the box, and the included instruction and user manuals covered many of the important aspects of the stick and throttle. You can customize the buttons to do whatever you want, and as I purchased it mainly for Elite: Dangerous, I was happy to see that they had a pre configured key mapping for this particular model. One important thing to note is that you will probably want to change the axis mode from 4 to 5 by hitting central button on the base of the throttle (I believe it glows red when it is in 4-axis mode, and it glows green when it is in 5-axis mode). Having the t-flight in 5-axis mode allows you to use the slider on the back of the throttle independently from the twisting motion on the stick. (Sorry if my terms are a little basic, I don't really know many of the proper names or anything). It is compatible with many versions of windows (including windows 7, 8, 8.1), and has plug and play technology, only requiring a compatible USB port and OS. Configuring it is fairly intuitive and instructions can be found both on the Internet and in the manual, however- at least in my experience, the plug and play features were not quite what I hoped they would be, and I chose to manually download the latest drivers and configuration software from the thustmaster website, which a quick search for &#34;Thrustmaster T-Flight X Drivers&#34; will most likely bring up. Having to look up the separate drivers, and the fact that the stick has a rather large dead zone and is not as sensitive as I like are the reasons I rate this product 4/5 stars- but for an introductory level product, it works very well and I would highly recommend it.	2015-08-08

Specifically any true golfer/golf fan, or anyone who has played any of the TW games.  Career mode is empty/lifeless. Few courses & the fantasy ones are awful. I really don't care ab the amount of players, as I used my created player (which is also terrible), but there are only a handful of golfers. The physics of the swing are questionable. Even in &#34;tour-mode&#34; the ball could be 2 ft. Above your feet and it does not seem to have any affect on the shot, or generate backspin somehow from &#34;heavy rough&#34;..There are absurd celebrations after you hole-out most of the time. Have you ever dropped a par putt after missing a 3-footer for bird, and danced all over the green in jubilation? I could go on for days with other issues... Game-modes taken out, the lifeless gallery, glitches that shows high grass on the putting surface, the commentary, etc...My opinion to people who do not want an EA version of Hot Shots Golf, or to feel like you just bought a $60 worthless demo, do NOT buy this.

I wanted to love this mouse. The ability to change sensitivity, the little weights, the customizable colors and thumb buttons are all great. It was like having a high end gaming mouse without the ridiculous price tag. The only problem, which is a pretty big problem, is the scroll wheel. Right out of the box, the scroll wheel gave me problems. It worked, but it was jittery. You would scroll up on a page, and every so often, you'd have it shake up and down before continuing on its way. It was a pretty minor problem, and one I wasn't too concerned about, even if it was pretty annoying. The mouse was cheap, and exceeding my expectations in every other way.<br /><br />But after about a week or two, the scroll wheel lost the ability to click. That ends up being an extremely annoying problem in games where you'd like to control the camera, or in whatever other application you'd use the scroll wheel click in. After about a month, my scroll stopped functioning all together. I continued using the mouse for a few months, and worked around it, but by the time i switched to an extremely basic but functioning mouse with a working wheel, I was relieved.<br /><br />I thought I might have just had a dud, but judging from other reviews, its a common problem. The scroll wheel is this products Achilles heel. Everything else about the mouse was fantastic, and if it wasn't for the scroll wheel, I would have been using Anker mouses for the rest of my life. Cheap price for what is advertised, and it would have been a great product if more care went into that wheels construction. I would love to try this product again if that problem is ever fixed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, its hard to recommend something that doesn't work correctly.	2015-08-08

I had about 2 of these and they broke cause i wasnt being gentle with it. These headsets are very fragile 1. youd start to notice part of the ear cuff hard piece slowly cracking apart. this is very easy to due if you keep taking off the headset by pulling the ear cuffs instead to minimize the damage by taking it off by pulling from the head ban. 2. a single drop can destroy these 3. its bulky like a fat boy. other than these 3 things ive mention about these headset, the experience is amazing. all your controls are on the headset and the bass impact is something you should look forward to trying out. plus the price is awesome! for what you get these headphone for your practically stealing money, just you need to baby it soo damn much, but once you get it down its beast!!! in also i would like to mention these are for home use only, take it out, and you have a good chance if breaking it.	2015-08-08

Akira Yamouka stopped doing the soundtracks years ago, which is painfully obvious on Downpour. The literal one-page manual that shows nothing except the control scheme in thin black & white paper was a major red flag upon opening this trash. I was almost not expecting an intro on the campy title screen; so was pleasantly surprised and a second after it started hearing a nauseating GRUNGE SONG complete with whimpering male vocals and s***ty 'Chug-chug-chug' guitars; this makes me sick and whoever put this on the intro and passed it needs to be dragged out into a dark parking lot & curb stomped for that decision.  Bad soundtrack aside, we know nothing, are walked thru the introduction with no info at all on where we are, who dude is, etc.  Then Im stabbing a guy with a really overly grossly drawn flabby body in a shower, where right away I can see how lame combat is now. (when I saw X button \\\"attack\\\\\" I thought oh boy, its like the 1980's again. Maybe they can just give us an old joystick with one red button for the next silent hill farce)  The two lame objects to kill the dude with keep breaking, so you run in circles till another knife reappears on a bench. LAME.  In fact, if you like running in circles alot, and hitting invisible boundaries and dead ends *constantly* then you'll love this Silent Hill Sewagepour. I got real claustrophobic in a real bad way, even in open terrain, due to invisible boundaries & an enraging amount ov barricaded dead ends. This isnt even fun at all, its just s***. And the characters are vapid and unremarkable, as are the environments. Enemies look like these same three people the whole game, the old beaten-into-the-carpet \\\\\"Japanese ghost girl with her hair in her face\\\\\" yeah, yeah we seen the Ring, Ringu, Grudge, Tartan asia horror films, yes sure whatever, get a new ghost concept now please, for god's sake its stale and not scary and very trite and unsurprising.

If there's one game to get in 2015, it's Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate!<br /><br />Having played Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, I welcome this new version, which mercifully removes the horrible underwater battles and replace it with climbing, jumping and mounting monsters!!! I played 100+ hours on MH3U and then I actually stopped playing (particularly hated the underwater battles), but I've already sunk in 200+ hours with MH4U and STILL playing it due to its much more fun gameplay, seamless online multiplayer gaming, beautiful graphics and of course, the crazy monsters and the monthly FREE DLCs that Nintendo keeps gifting to us MH4U players! I'm glad I took the time to learn MH3U so with MH4U it's a lot easier for me to just pick up and go.<br /><br />There is SO much replay value, and hunting the same monster species feels different each time because of the monster AI, location where it is, etc. The new weapons (my favourite being Insect Glaive, having used Long Sword in the past) are just super fun to use. And of course, I often get hit by the monsters as I get distracted on trying to mount them...! Fun fun fun!<br /><br />The multiplayer truly shines through here. It is so seamless to go online multiplayer, and playing with a bunch of strangers doesn't matter when all 4 hunters have the same goal - slay (or capture) the blinking monster!!! It's so strange, you end up making some friends with these hunters really. Generally the multiplayer community is friendly to new and experienced players alike, which is helpful.<br /><br />It's so unbelievably good that I bought a New Nintendo 3DS XL (MH4U themed of course) for this game alone, but of course, benefitting me for other games too with faster loading times, etc. If you haven't tried it MH4U is actually much more newbie friendly in that it guides you through most of the stuff so you don't fumble (like in MH3U). Get on the hunt and see you online!	2015-08-08

Before you go out and buy a Game Shark Pro GBC 3.0, be sure you know how to properly use it. These cheat devices can and will erase<br />your game codes if used the wrong way. If you're interested in buying one, I highly suggest you find one with the original manual if you can.<br />It will make things a lot easier for you, believe me. If used properly, the Game Shark can help you beat those really hard GB & GBC games<br />you had trouble with in the past. I currently have one now and after all these years, it still works good.

The house building tool is awesome, social interaction has never been better but that's where it ends. No matter how many times I try and play Sims 4 I feel like I am taking a step backwards from Sims 3. I can't even walk down the street to a neighbors house anymore. The &#34;villages&#34; consist of 5 houses and unless you want to spend all your time at home, a friends house or a night club you can't do anything. I have owned every Sims game and expansion that ever came out from the original Sims until the release of Sims 4, that has ended as I'm not going to waste my money on an upgrade to an old game (Sims 2). I really hope they stop making expansions for Sims 4 and start working on a Sims 5 where you can feel like the game took a step forward and not back. Sims 3 and their expansions were the greatest. They were fun and well thought out and I was always excited for the next one. I really hope EA gets there act together and restores the greatness to a great game. I'm sticking with Sims 3 until Sims 5 comes out.	2015-08-08

(that is until the fantastic remake &#34; Dead or Alive 2: Ultimate&#34; on the original Xbox).<br /><br />this is the Japanese only release &#34;Hard*Core&#34;  (make note of the &#34;star&#34; in the middle of hardcore, as its confusingly the only way to visually tell the difference at a glance without looking at the back of the box or playing the game)<br /><br />it's an upgraded version of the original &#34;hardcore&#34; release that we saw in America  and Europe,  containing more costumes, cut scenes and a few tweaks to the fighting system.  no emulator is able to run this version of the game (at this time).  so you will need original hardware to play. (I use swap magic to play on my American PlayStation 2)<br /><br />highly recommended for fighting game fans. it's very import friendly ( has several language options,).	2015-08-08

That game was so amazing that it just blew my mind. Therefore I had to give this one a try. After finishing the story and playing new game+, here is what I think.<br />***********************************************************************************PROS*************************************************************************************<br />-Stealth and Combat Mechanics: This is what I liked the most about the Arkham City and also what I like the most about this game. You can take the enemies out sneakily or just beat them up using Batman's physical skills as well as unique gadgets. The game gives you plenty of options in terms of how you want to take the enemies out in most of the areas and one you master some basic controls this stealth and combat gameplay becomes quite fun and addicting. It was the best part of this game.<br /><br />-Gotham Openworld Gameplay: This game has a very nicely designed Gotham city with a lo... Read more	2015-08-08

After one year of playing this game, it's enough time to give a review.  My subscription expires next week and I won't be renewing. I'll go from start to the point where I am now.  Character Creation - This is okay, not enough custom work leaves so many players looking exactly the same.  Graphics - It does look pretty, very animated. However, you compared to Skyrim and such games it doesn't have any amazing sights. Nowhere blows your mind.  Main Story - It's not terrible, however, the find and fetch quests are pretty soul destroying. Once the original 2.0 story is completed you lose all care. The patches that followed were very dull The story was predictable, and more than anything the game lacks a real villain. The characters who you talk to a lot are forgettable and annoying. They just didn't have the edge you have experienced in previous FF games. I know this is MMORPG, but it is still Final Fantasy who has supplied players with some of the greatest characters of all time.  Battle System - It is fun at first, however, it dies so fast. There is no challenge to the game, if people find it challenging it is because they don't do anything else with their lives. All the big battles have set routines, so you always know what is going to happen. This isn't fun. Every dungeon, the tank will collect the trash and everyone else just does their AOE's, every single dungeon feels the same. It doesn't feel like you're going into battle at all. Even FF7 felt more engaging.  World Map - Pathetic, the game struggles with an identity. Floating land masses, small areas, glowing crystal crap everywhere. It looks like a child has designed it.  Extras - This game is here purely because of nostalgia. If it didn't have Final Fantasy in the title, I'd have never have bothered buying it. It keeps throwing previous Final Fantasy (better FFs) at players to keep them there. The Golden Saucer is a complete joke, anyone involved in FFVII should sue these people for insulting their creation. They force you to grind the Triple Triad card game, Chocobo Racing with friends isn't fun. It's just dull. So much is missing from the extras.  Ultimately, what this game is missing more than anything else if FUN. Nothing, on this game is fun maybe except PVP but often you're waiting over an hour just for one match. I'd not recommend this game to anyone. There were times I did enjoy it, but for the time and money I invested, I'd say so much of my free time has been wasted on this game. The community is not as great as they claim to be. Players cheat, you're always getting messages from people selling the currency, every patch that is released as the same as the last, they offer no creativity.  If you're new to the game, more than ever you will be at a huge disadvantage. There's no housing available so you miss out on content, when you reach level 50 you don't get any experience from dungeons so it'll feel like a huge road block, because of gil sellers the economy means you won't make much money, They released new jobs with the expansion which are gated - they could have easily fitted them in but SE are so lazy they went with the worst option.  Anyway, if just one person doesn't buy this game based on this review, I've done my work. Don't waste your time with it.	2015-08-08

Ok I've looked at different brands of Wii2HDMI and some of these are legit and some aren't. YOU NEED TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHERE YOU BUY FROM!!! Here are the pros and cons, some of the Wii2HDMI will have input lag if you don't use it in over a month I believe. I had mine and I forgot which vendor I bought it from and it didn't last very long. I'm looking for a legit vendor with a legit Wii2HDMI that will last for ages and wont over heat. It still works its just I keep getting awful input lag and its trying to over heat. And if you guys have a backwards compatible Gamecube Wii, then your in luck. It upscales your Gamecube game to 720p to 1080p. Well not really. I have tested it with Twilight Princess Gamecube version and I have gotten it to work with pretty good picture. And I have tested Wii2HDMI with Skyward Sword if your a Zelda fan like me and it worked perfectly fine. It still shows some pixels here and there, yet it still looks pretty crisp. You wont get full 1080p. It just makes it look more clearer and better. If you want to make it look better for gameplay. I really suggest going into your HDTV settings and changing the contrast and brightness and sharpness if you want to make it look better. I did that and it looked great. &#34;Minus pixels showing&#34; Over all it did the trick. I think it will work on virtual console games too. But I am not entirely sure. You'll have to figure that out. If this vendor sells more Wii2HDMI, I will diffidently buy one since reviews are good. Guys. Do me a favor, please read reviews before you buy and ask questions and get answers from the seller or other people, it really does help. And do your homework before you buy!	2015-08-08

If you see the game for going for $30 or less definitely get it any higher and you might feel disappointed unless you're a hardcore hockey fan and have to have every NHL game out there.	2015-08-08

Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of say an astro gaming or turtle beach headset but as an actual Microsoft product it works perfectly with the XBOX ONE and can be used on any device with headphone jacks. Wired to controller but wireless from console audio is good however sometimes the controls between volume for ppl vs audio for game is inconsistent. Decent value when it dies I'll likely buy another instead of the more pricey afformentioned companies headsets and it blows the cheap versions out of the water also. All in all a good everyday gamers headset	2015-08-08

Mad Catz used what they have learned and also took some cues from it's competitors to make what I consider their best stick ever.<br /><br />Let's start with the good.  It is a lot easier to open this stick now.  The button opens it up and you are quickly able to have access to the inside of your stick.  That's right, no more having to carry around an allen wrench to open it up.  Speaking of opening it up, you are now able to use this as storage also.  It comes with a tool and you are able to store extra parts in their as needed, there is even room to put a game in their.  They got these design cues from Razer, but I feel that they made it better with the extra room they have in there and with the compartment of the cord.  Customization, looks like it was a big focus with Mad Catz with this stick and they made sure that anyone could join in the fun for a cheap price with this stick.  Panel are is easily added into this stick, all you need to do is print out a pictures, you are also able to switch out side panels to the color of your choice.  This with the addition to the easy opening of the stick makes this easier and faster than ever before.  A nice touch is also the ability to switch between PS3 and PS4 which also means you can use this stick on the PC.  Very nice touch meaning that you can get this stick for your PS4 and still use it on your PS3 because the fighting game library is bigger and you can take it places and not worry as much about being limited.<br /><br />We can go to the bad now.  The top plexy that goes over the art kind of moves a little bit.  Could be annoying because other sticks didn't have that and people might not like that.  The cord to plug into the console isn't as long as Razers.  The Razer Atrox has a better hinge opening design and is easier to open because it has a hydraulic arm inside.  Lastly the bottom of the stick doesn't have a honeycomb floor so it's a little harder to secure extraPCBs.  None of them are deal breakers but I mention because the chief rival of the stick has it.<br /><br />All in all this is a wonderful stick with a lot of great features with an excellent design.  It's a premium stick and if you can afford it I would definitely pick this one up.	2015-08-08

It's a sad sad little boner game and I was really hoping it would be kinda fun to play to enhance the pervyness, but it's not. If you really like DMC and boobs, you might enjoy this, but if you prefer a Dark Souls/Ninja Gaiden approach to combat (slightly grounded) and kinda hate DMC, there's nothing left but skimpy outfits, and a very bad game.	2015-08-08

The graphics are good, not great and the camera is pretty bad but the gameplay is pretty fun overall. The voice acting is okay, it seems to get better as the game goes on.

Quick rundown:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Assortment of side missions to keep you busy and entertained while you work slowly through the main missions to explore and demolish the bad guys.<br />-Graphics are awesome and Gotham has never looked better. Weather effects, atmosphere, colors/lights are all great. They really did a nice job polishing this game.<br />-Some stories are a lot of fun. This includes moments of actual suspense and cheap scare tactics in areas. As a result, the subject matter may be a little too advanced for little children who love Batman. Not so much in the scary moments, but the sexual content and violence are in there like the others.<br />-Fight system is familiar and relatively simplistic.

It only turns your guns full auto but doesn't actually rapid fire at all. About 85% of the time when you activate it in pvp it doesn't work and it just glitches your sights all over the place. I've tried reprogramming it like in the instructions but it just doesn't work. Tried contacting moddedzone but no answer. It feels lighter and cheaper than a normal PS4 controller. This controller just flat out doesn't work for Destiny and I will be returning mine. If you are buying this for Destiny, save your money.	2015-08-08

Brand new in original package. The price is justified considering this is a discontinued item. I've ordered used cables and they end up being damaged (loose connection to TV/damaged PSP connection). Yes, games get cropped a little. People complain about the 'quality' but you have to remember you're enlarging a 4&#34; PSP display with COMPONENT cables on your 32&#34;+ flat screen. This does not convert to HD lol. Says PSP-2000 only but works with 3000 series. These came out when it was only the PSP-1000/2000 models. They do not work with the original 1000 model.	2015-08-08

So far vey satisfied with the stand. My only problem with the stand is how difficult it is to get the controllers to fit into the charger docks. I had a really bad experience with a stand-alone charger stand where the micro-USB head broke off if the controllers were not inserted carefully. It's not a drop-and-charge and you're ready to go, since if you have grips on your controllers, you'll have to take them off as they won't fit into the docks with them on. But after being careful with charging the controllers, the overall quality is very good. There are THREE extra USB-ports which doubles the available ports on the PS4 (one port is used by the stand). The sound of the fan is VERY QUIET despite all the other reviewer complaints. If you have your tv at a reasonable sound level, you will not hear the fans on the vertical stand.	2015-08-08

Played this with super smash bros (Wii U and Brawl) and Mario Kart. Work great. It's sometimes unfortunately hard to use the plus or start buttons with the game cube controllers but it's usually not too hard to use.<br /><br />The responsiveness is on par with the actual remotes and Wii U gamepad itself.

This review is specifically for the Windows boxed edition.  Pros:  1) First person view for those who care to play with it is now added to the game.  2) Gorgeous graphics - I play on GTX 970 and you will need at least a 3 GB video memory to experience the true graphical prowess this version brings. Don't bother buying this otherwise and stick to the console version which is equivalent to playing this on medium graphic settings.  3) Physical version saves you about 60 GB of internet bandwidth and you can always re-install it if you find yourself with a PC but with no internet ever. Physical media also comes with a nice paper map.  4) Most editions sold are still the pre-order editions and will give you 500k cash in single player and 500k cash in multiplayer mode to start you off. Get some guns, get an apartment, and climb socially in Los Santos!  Cons:  1) 7 DVDs, so it obviously took forever to install - almost 45 minutes if I can recall.  2) Other reviewers have slapped this game for the additional 5 GB download it needs despite installing all the DVDs. I agree. It is not fair, and I am taking one star off for this very reason.  3) Finally, another star is off because GTA online is practically unplayable with the hackers at this point.	2015-08-08

My daughter recently bought a PS4 system and I ordered the dual charging station for her to use.  My biggest pet peeve are cords hanging and dangling, it just looks messy and let’s face it a hazard especially when your concentration is solely focused on the game.  The base is light weight, small and holds 2 controllers nicely.  While it is sturdy enough to charge and store the controllers, I wouldn’t recommend excessive force (children and overzealous adults) yanking and jerking them around.  The best part is 2 controllers will fully charge in 4-5 hours and ready for action. It literally is a plug and play device; complete with a USB cord.  The only downside is the lack of an indicator light to let you know exactly what is going on with the charge or lack thereof.  Considering the prices of docking stations, this is a good deal for the advertised price.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-08

My husband was super excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product. This game comes with the CD ready to install right away. There are so many characters that you can chose to play as since there are so many and there is the new system upgrade. Personally my husband absolutely loves Bumblebee so of course he would choose Bumblebee as his character. You can customize it to your liking. You can instantaneously switch between being in robot mode, vehicle mode, and weapons mode whenever you would like to. This game is not for anybody younger than a teenager. There is some mild language and some violence as well. In order to play the game you need to put in the registration code and sign the enclosed licensing agreement.

Had several friends try it and they agree.	-Firstly, the packaging says it's a back light. But to install it, you have to peel off the original gba's outer screen and stick this one on instead, thus making it a FRONT LIGHT. The light is being placed **in front** of the screen.<br />So don't let the packaging and advertisements fool you. A back-lit screen is always going to look better than a front-lit one.<br /><br />-Secondly, it runs off of the gba's power by connecting to its game link cable port. A nice feature is  that they added a pass-through port so that you can still insert the game link cable to play multiplayer games.<br />However, the gba to GameCube cable will not fit so you would have to remove the top piece if you want to connect the gba to a GameCube. Not a big deal, but something that should be noted in case somebody plans on using it with their GameCube.<br /><br />-Since it draws a small amount of power through the game link cable port, the light is pretty dim. Either everyone is lying when they say that it's bright and looks just like a GBA SP, or my product is defective. Because even on the highest brightness setting it is still hard to see and not very bright.<br /><br />-Imagine going to the &#34;color&#34; setting on your television and reducing it to about 1/4. That's the effect the light has on the screen. It washes out the colors! There is also an internal glare in between the light and the gba screen itself that simply can't be avoided, causing an annoying horizontal line reflection effect to happen, greatly reducing visibility.<br /><br />That's really all I have to say about this. The washed out colors is the worst part in my opinion. If it was a little dim but at least had distinguishable colors, I might recommend it. But it lies by saying it's a backlight, doesn't get very bright, fades the colors, and has a weird reflection that makes it strenuous to try and see the game. I even let some of my friends give it a try and they couldn't even play it for more than 2 minutes without getting frustrated. In a very dark room maybe it's a LITTLE okay, and that's why I will give it 2 stars. But otherwise I'd definitely say you're better off getting a GBA SP, trying some other kind of device that can light the screen, or just playing under a lamp.	2015-08-08

Turning on the controller and it recognizing the PC is actually faster than turning it on and waiting for the 360 to recognize it, so that's a nice feature.

I wanted to get this for my Xbox one and for my PC. I was not sure what plugs I would be getting because the product info wasn't clear but it does work for both.

The cups are not large enough to go around your ears. It makes my ears hurt after 30 mins or so.

And imo, these are the best ones out there: The PS3's R2/L2 buttons are very oddly shaped and don't work that well, but with these they become near-perfect.<br /><br />I know a lot of people like the Gioteck ones, but for me they didn't feel very ergonomic; they curved far too upwards and almost felt like you were pressing down on them with the side of your finger rather than the bottom. But with these triggers, the curve isn't as dramatic and your fingers fall right where they should. They feel extremely similar to the PS4 controller's triggers, only a little bit larger. And yes, you can rest the controller on a flat surface without R2/L2 being accidentally pressed (no more fast forwarding through Netflix).<br /><br />Only downside is that the bottom corners of these triggers can be a little sharp, so try not to hover your fingers directly under them when holding the controller. Other than that, these are by far the best trigger attachments you can buy for Dualshock 3. Highly recommended.	2015-08-08

I was a die-hard fan of the other two games (Didn't play Arkham Origins because it wasn't made my rocksteady). As I came across this game I was absolutely amazed it only received 4 stars. Going through the reviews I saw people hating on the Batmobile, saying you are far too dependent on it. However that is not entirely true. It is required for certain missions, yes, but you do not need it as much as people depict. If you wanna travel across the map and need to get there quick, jump the f out of the Batmobile and go fly over there! They GREATLY improved the upgrade system in that now you can upgrade how far you can travel with the push off grappling buildings. So, bottom line, you don't wanna use it, don't!<br />Here's what I thought about for its pro's and con's:<br />PRO'S:<br />•Graphics are absolutely stunning<br />•FPS is consistently smooth, with extremely rare pauses due to autosaves<br />•Story is FAR better than the other two, which I was quite worried about considering Joker wasn't gonna be a part ...

The first one stopped working suddenly after a week or so of steady use, so I contacted ET and they sent a replacement in hope that it was simply the odd mouse out in the batch, as it were. I have been using the replacement for about three months now, and I can affirm that the mouse is actually quite comfortable and works great. The laser is sensitive enough for the mouse to be used on the arms of chairs and couches even. It is plug and play, and the USB receiver is cleverly stored on the underside of the mouse when not in use (such as when travelling). It takes a single AA battery, which I have found lasts about two months. A related feature is that the mouse will shut off automatically when not in use even if you leave it on (not sure how long it takes for it to do so, but it definitely does). All it takes to turn it back on is to click the L button. Speaking of...there are actually two &#34;on&#34; modes...standard, and backlit. The mouse is also fairly substantial and mine has definitely taken a lot of falls and such with no seeming ill effect. Also, it has little grips on the side that are designed to give you better grip while also providing greater comfort when using the mouse (those little lit circles on the side of the product page pic)/ They are quite nice.<br /><br />So, all that would normally earn this 5 stars. However, it has a simple design flaw that forces me to take one star off. On the left side are two buttons (basically they function as your back/forward browser arrows). They are great. However, their location guarantees that you will hit these inadvertently, and often, lol. I would like to have seen them put one button on either side instead, and move them a little closer to the front edge of the mouse. This simple design adjustment would solve that issue completely.<br /><br />Anyway, other than that, the only thing worth noting is that the ones I received to review were all red and black rather than the blue/black shown on the page. Not sure if this is consistent with what you will receive if you order one of these.<br /><br />So...all told, an easy 4 stars, and a simple manufacturing adjustment on their end would make this a 5 star mouse.that the ones I received to review were all red and black rather than the blue/black shown on the page.

These triggers fix those problems somewhat, but they bring with them a fair share of problems.  Although these triggers are curved, they curve a little bit TOO far outwards. Rather than only giving the bottom of the R2/L2 a slight curve to prevent slipping (like the PS4 controller), the whole trigger itself is curved from the top down. Therefore, you feel like you're pressing down on R2/L2 with the sides of your fingers instead of your bottom fingerprint, creating a slightly awkward grip with your index fingers.  The triggers extend outward so much that fully pressing down on R2/L2 feels somewhat deceptive: with these triggers on, your fingers stop at the halfway point of a naked R2/L2 full button press. In other words, even though you may be fully pressing the button, with these triggers on it almost feels like you're pressing halfway. For games that rely on R2/L2's pressure sensitivity (like GTA 4 and 5), this is a very noticeable shift, and for me was pretty uncomfortable.  I also found that they don't stay on very securely; they'd fall off even after play sessions only 2-3 hours long, maybe due to the aforementioned awkward grip.  I'd recommend the Subsonic PS3 Triggers over these. I got them from Amazon years ago and absolutely swear by them: they don't curve too far outwards, and they're much more ergonomic. Feel very close to a Dualshock 4 PS4 Controller, except a little bigger. Looks like they're out of stock on Amazon but you can eBay them.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-x-NEW-Subsonic-PS3-Controller-Triggers-Pair-2-Packs-Sony-DualShock-3-SixAxis-/271405502020?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f31074e44  Been using these for years and absolutely swear by them, give them a look!hem, give them a look!	2015-08-08

This is a great way to work off those pounds and have a good time doing it. I will warn you, start slow... Zumba is not for the faint hearted but there are various levels you can work out to during selection process.

The one I had looked ok but it was very thin and never fit correctly from day one and the longer it was on the controller, the more stretched out it became until it was actually impeding game play.  So, I looked at this set and decided to order it, the price was low and you get four controller covers - 2 black, 1 blue and 1 red.  They arrived today and I am quite pleased with them and they look exactly as pictured.  They are extremely easy to slip onto the controllers and there was no fear that I was going to rip/damage it during installation.  Once installed, it is a perfect fit - even though the material is thicker, the select and start buttons are easily accessible.  These skins are a little different design than the last one I had, which fully covered the entire controller except the charging port, joysticks and buttons - as a result it was harder to install and it felt like it was going to rip the entire time.  While these skins don't cover quite as much of the controller (the bottom, middle section is exposed), it is a much better fit and are much thicker so I don't think they will stretch at all.  Each controller cover came sealed in its own bag inside another bag and the only gripe is that they smell badly - even after washing/soaking them and leaving them outside for a few hours but that finally went away after about 2 days.  I would recommend these because they fit perfectly, offer some protection to the controller and offer a nice, non-slip, comfortable grip.	2015-08-08

The Vita's sticks, for me, simply don't feel right. They're so small that you end up tilting them where you want to go instead of pressing and guiding them. These analog caps fix that, and every Vita owner should have a pair.  Firstly, these are not hard plastic; they're silicone caps. They're a little tricky to put on; you align the lip of the cap on one side of the stick, and then push the the cap over the rest of the stick in the opposite direction until they sit tightly over the stick. In my experience, these caps are very secure once put on properly; they stay on even when slipping the Vita in/out of a carrying pouch.  These grips enhance the surface area of the sticks making for a much better feel; Of the 6 pairs included in the Amazon main picture, I use the bottom left (concave, like Xbox 360), bottom right (concentric circles, like Gamecube), and middle right (convex dotted surface, somewhat like PS3). I like the concave ones the most, but they all work very well. Playing Killzone Mercenary with these on vs off is a night and day difference. Can't comment on the D-pad add-ons, but they are plastic and attach to the Vita's D-pad with tape blocks, so I avoided them altogether.  And at a price of $4, these are a no brainer. Sony should consider officially licensing these so they can be sold in store: these are Vita essentials.	2015-08-08

This is a bit of a disappointment if you are into playing online, but won't matter for solo play.  The microphone retracts when not in use, so it stays out of the way.  This is a nice feature and it should help keep the mic safe.The battery seems to last about 12 - 13 hours, which is pretty decent.  You will likely be charging the unit each night, so the battery life is just fine, as most people won't be playing games for 13 hours a day.<br /><br />The build quality is good and the fit is comfortable.  The headset feels very solid and it is not at all flimsy.  The fact that they are truly wireless makes them even more comfortable, as you don't have that extra cable hanging in your way.	2015-08-08

First of all is the horrible camera and sticky control system used when web swinging. In my opinion, it was handled far better in Spider-Man 2 and 3 as in this game it never feels natural or that you're really in control.<br />Second is the Hero / Menace system which while hyped on the box, quickly becomes annoying. It basically boils down to Spidey having to stop a series of crimes or disasters to keep his hero reputation up, because if he doesn't, it'll dip down into menace and the police (who are very effective) will relentlessly pursue him until he's dead. This means having to stop exploring the city because if Spidey doesn't stop a petty crime for the 1,237th time and view the same cut scene over and over and over again, he'll be dead within a few minutes because the police are lethal.<br />Combat tries hard to be like the Arkham series of games, but lacks the polish and execution. The special attacks that you unlock with tech points don't really amount to much either.<br />That being said, there are a few nice touches in this game, such as some stealth options and having to unlock a series of different costumes which affects Spidey's abilities. If you want a tip, purchase the DLC outfit pack which has the black symbiote costume, as that augments Spidey's abilities to a point where he'll always have a clear advantage going into fights.<br />If you're a Spider-Man fan, chances are you'll like it. However if you're a gamer looking to scratch a casual Spider-Man itch, you're better off blowing the dust off of your old copy of Spider-Man 3.	2015-08-08

The figure I received was the Japanese release of the Ganondorf amiibo for Smash3ds/WiiU.<br /><br />Functionally, it's identical to the US/EU versions which have yet to be released, much like other JP amiibo figures.  No articulation present, again like other amiibos.  The figure is firmly rooted into the amiibo stand and has great appeal as a simple figure, considering the quality of the sculpt.<br /><br />In-game functionality, Ganandorf is a brute who can smash like there's no tomorrow.  Focusing primarily on stage-fighting, being patient, and abusing the side-special and its various follow-ups, Ganondorf is easily my strongest amiibo, despite not doing too much different while raising it to level 50 compared to the others.<br /><br />This product is worth picking up as a Zelda fan, as a collector of amiibos, and as a Smash Bros fan.  If you're willing to wait, (and fight off the scalpers), then feel free to do so and save the ~$5, but as far as I'm concerned, this product was worth the cost of import, due to both convenience and shipping speed.	2015-08-08

Just be aware, they really only last for smash bros players for a couple of months before the joystick's padding comes off. After that, the C-stick may become a little unresponsive at times or some buttons may have slight difficulties. But it's really easy to replace and I'll definitely buy again! As for the first open, it's very responsive in timing and the cord is the average cord length. The frame holds well and works well. 10/10 would buy again!	2015-08-08

I have thoroughly enjoyed Morrow mind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.<br />This is NOT and Elder Scrolls game, regardless of what the title says. This is a FP-MMO-RPG. For a next gen game the graphics are awful, not the worst I've seen in my life, but defiantly not indicative of a next gen title. Every door opened is another loading screen. There is no way to put away your weapon, aside from &#34;interacting&#34; with an object or person. The combat is something I would imagine would have been inventive in the first months of PS3 & XBox 360, but after playing titles Like The Witcher 3 and Dragon age inquisition, this seems like a rip-off.<br /><br />Graphics : Im not saying the graphics are bad, it just reminds me of oblivion. When you &#34;open&#34; a door, your hand kind of waves in front of the screen and the door moves ever so slightly, then it's a loading screen. Oh yes EVERY door leads to a loading screen.<br />Now the loading times aren't that bad, considering there are a LOT of them i'd say that's a good thing.<br /><br />Character creation is pretty good but superficial at best. No matter what character you choose, it's the same quests, your character is not treated any different whether your an Orc, Kahjit, or Nord, ike Bethesda has done in the past.<br />The class system is ok, but not anywhere near indicative of true Bethesda.<br />Quests are linear, There is nothing about the story that grabs you. This is an MMO, and to be honest, after playing 30 hours or so on ESO, I can confidently say  it's basically World Of Warcraft, well not basically, it IS WoW just with first person.<br />Honestly I am an RPG fanatic, I love Bethesda's game, I own all of them to date.<br />But this game is just awful, and I can't believe Bethesda is making folks pay a $60 price tag for this.<br />I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, even as a prank. It's a total waste of money, bad graphics, awful voice acting, uninteresting and linear quest lines with no investment to care what the NPC's are even saying. All in all a massive fail.<br />On a positive note if your an MMO fan you'll love this brand spanking new version of World Of Warcraft...er....Elder Scrolls?acting, uninteresting and linear quest lines with no investment to care what the NPC's are even saying. All in all a massive fail.<br />On a positive note if your an MMO fan you'll love this brand spanking new version of World Of Warcraft...er....Elder Scrolls?	2015-08-08

I was looking for a racing game that has real physics, is challenging and where I still have a chance. This game will not be sold for a long, long time. There are no gimmicks, just fast and intense racing. While i can see the knocks for not having a career mode where you start from a wee lad and work your way up - there is still plenty to love in this game.<br /><br />The detail is there, the driver and AI levels allow you to start with competition at your level and advance it until there is no assists and the race results and competition is realistic. You can choose to run away with the championship or fight for it. From a technical perspective you can get very detailed or moderately but you do need to be involved in the set up for each track and thus having practice and qualifying helps. I have also see people knock the race length. Considering you can save mid race i would recommend full race or half race length so you get the longer practice sessions (you can fast forward time or skip ahead) and you have way more strategy and dynamic race weather if you opt for these instead of the short program.<br />One thing i love is that while you can save your set up for each track, it will not make a car from Williams or Force India handle the way your mercedes or Ferrari cars did when you created that setup. So the teams are dynamic in a way also.<br /><br />I have seen people mention a glitch when exiting pit lane on some courses. I have experienced this also, you are stuck in 2nd gear even though you have it set to drive an automatic. 1st I agree a patch should come, 2nd this is not a major glitch (I even wondered if it was slightly intentional to mimic driver error or just mechanical failure that does happen in real life), 3rd (Solution) on your end you can avoid the engine damage if you just manually shift to 3rd gear after control is released back to you when exiting the pits (when driving in automaticyou can still up and down shift).<br /><br />For the record the last few years I have become board much faster with every C.O.D. release. Need for speed needs to go back to offline emphasis  with a great online feature. No games should be built to rely on micro transactions for the xbox1 or PS4 - this game has none. If you love Formula 1 this adds to the racing fun - you feel more connected to the championship than in Forza or Gran Turismo. The cockpit mode seems more realistic compared to that of other racing games where the dimensions of the cabin and view around you doesn't feel right when driving a road car. Therefor the driving feels more intense and realistic, yet the physics, view and perspective feels real.<br /><br />I have race 2 seasons so far, one on short race length and easy with RedBull 2014 season and one with half race length and medium difficulty Williams 2014 season. They felt very different because of the dynamic race conditions, dynamic car set ups, dynamic team setups and AI racing differently in those seasons.<br /><br />The only complaints I really have race to race is this: if I decided to alter my tire strategy on race day to start on the Prime instead of Option tire my team engineer doesn't seem to adjust my pit window/strategy in the race. So even though i should be on a longer 1st stint he still calls me into the pits as if I am on the original pit strategy. So i have to ignore him and wait until I feel my tires going off or lap times slowing down. 2nd when it starts to rain and you have to go to the pits for tires you may decide the roll the dice on if the rain will last or get heavy Or you may just decided on a dry race day to change your tire strategy in the middle of the race; your engineer won't question you if you make a horrible choice or even if you accidentally choose to put on the Option again, even though you haven't run Prime tires yet, and by choosing the Option tire you will be throwing the race away because you haven't metthe requirements of running both in the race - they will not let you know that. While the engineer info over the radio is quite good and helpful elsewhere, it fails in that instance.<br /><br />I do not use Kinect for any games, never set it up. So I use the LB1 and D-pad to initiate all communication on my end with the team in pit lane. It is very difficult to do this on the track in a race without memorizing all menu commands and order and even some menus go away before you can toggle down to the correct selection while you try to brake at the end of a straight and not go off track. Perhaps the time you are in pit lane driving towards your team and not in control of the car would be a good time to also allow us to indicate tire choice, downforce adjustments.<br /><br />Overall this is been my favorite game purchase of the last 3 years. No more college football, hockey is okay, first person shooters are all the same, The Crew was fun but novelty wears off fast. Grand Theft Auto still Amazing. Hoping for great things from the newest Need for Speed, i hope they back up the talk and make it a true combo of the best games in the series while moving away from micro transactions and online forced play. Tomb Raider - hopeful if it goes back to the basis from the first two. All Basketball games have become unrealistic in movement and AI forcefields. Assassin's Creed - needs to shake up the story and get back to it's roots while keeping the upgraded hand to hand but losing the defend the streets, command and army and and all the hunting/crafting. I need more interesting things like the brain teasers and puzzles and great story.<br /><br />That is all for now. Cheers	2015-08-08

So, I reluctantly installed Steam and then it installed it on my  Windows 8.1 gaming rig but then I could only play for 5 minutes before there was a BUG. I could not go any  further because I had to press [F] to give something to the Empress but the game would not recognize my [F] key.   The key works. I can type FFF all day long. And a scene right before had me press [F] and it worked. But, since  I could not give whatever I was supposed to to the Empress, the game STOPS.  5 minutes of gameplay,  IF THAT.  As usual, PC game full og BUGS.	2015-08-08

When I first got it and started using it, I would have rated it 5/5. It feels great, looks great, and worked great. However, over the course of the first four months or so, the left trigger started going bad - not losing sensitivity, but gaining sensitivity. It got to the point where the left trigger was randomly aiming my weapon on FPS games without my even touching it. Needless to say, this makes the games completely unplayable. Hopefully I just got a lemon...but be warned.	2015-08-08

Just in case you're like me and didn't think ahead....<br /><br />REMEMBER THAT THE Wii IS BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE AND THEREFOR IT WILL RUN GAMECUBE GAMES, BUT IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A GAMECUBE-STYLE CONTROLLER THAT IS WII-COMPATIBLE.

The inside is overly large with no padding inside and nothing to secure the system in place. You are likely to damage the system if you carry this thing. The styluses are about three time normal size and thickness (will not fit into the back of a 3DS). The two game and stylus slots are actually outside of the pouch underneath the flap meaning that the styluses stick out when closed and the games don't feel secured.  The &#34;map&#34; is about a third of the size of a dollar bill and so blurry you can't see any detail. It is also made of a more coarse material that does not equate to a cleaning cloth.
