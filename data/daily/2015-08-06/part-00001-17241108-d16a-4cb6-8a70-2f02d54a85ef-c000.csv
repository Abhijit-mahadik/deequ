US	37424147	R13P55NCMJPUNI	B00IPGWPWW	686329743	To Boot New York Men's Scott Boot	Shoes	5	2	2	N	Y	Very simple, very elegant, and very comfortable	Following the tradition of To Boot, the Scott is  very well made.  The leather is supple, and while showing imperfections, these do not detract from the appearance but add a flavour of originality.  One of the major attractions of the boot is its restrained character: there is no ornamentation, no fancy stitching, but plain simplicity of the front which, when polished to high lustre, makes the boot perfect for wearing  both with a formal navy or black suit as much as with a pair of khakis.  The elegance of the boot is amplified by the tall, quite narrow shaft that follows the contour of the lower calf and vanishes high up  within the trouser leg: a superb way of eliminating the wearer's fear that the hem of the latter will get stuck on the top of the shaft, which is a common occurrence with ankle-long shafts.  Thee narrowness of the shaft does not impair the ease of donning the boot at all: the full length zipper is placed in a manner that facilitates pulling the boot on.  Originally, I feared the shaft will be the reason for return: I had a major foot surgery recently and ended up with a fairly restricted mobility of the ankle joint.  It seemed I will not be able to put my foot inside the boot.  To my amazement - although with the help of a longish steel shoe horn - the foot went in without any difficulties.  Once there, the boot felt like a very comfortable medical device that supports and holds the foot firmly in place, assisting in walking rather than impeding it!  Thus, even under these somewhat taxing circumstances, the boots proved to be very comfortable, and a great pleasure to wear. Please, note that the boot is not meant to be used roughly.  It IS a dress boot: a simple one, but also one that is very elegant even if its shape is somewhat old--fashioned (Amazon's photograph does not do it full justice). Hence,  it will require both sensible use and maintenance: avoid &#34;lumberjacking&#34;  while wearing these boots, apply high quality polish frequently (due to the high quality of leather, high gloss is quite easily attainable), and a set of cedar shoe trees ready to use after each wearing, and you will have a splendid addition to your &#34;manly wardrobe&#34;  that will last several years.	2015-08-06

Also arrived right on time.  I bought them for use in my kayak.  They offer excellent heel protection from the hard hull.  Also protect the soles of my feet from bruising while standing hard on the kayak's foot pegs.  Even with very little arch support, the fit is extremely comfortable which I really appreciate because of Parifial Neurothopy in my feet.  I've ended up wearing them as a casual shoe for driving and scuffing around both inside and outside the house.  They appear to be holding up well.  As a bonus, they look good!<br />Would recommend to a friend and will buy again.	2015-08-06

These are the most stylish work shoes I have ever seen. When I say work shoes, I do mean shoes that are classy yet provide good comfort throughout the day. Don't be fooled by shoes that look classy yet destroy your feet if you are standing all day. Its very well cushioned, good arch suport, great quality leather and materials and above all style. However these shoes are very narrow even for someone like me who doesnt have wide feet. I highly recommend you get this in wider size. I had to get them stretched out at the dry cleaners so now they are more comfortable but still not as comfortable as I'd like them to be. At work I dont walk a lot but stand all day and these really help my feet and legs. But if I wear them to town and start walking a lot then my toes will pay the price.	2015-08-06

The second boot I sprayed directly at a distance and rubbed it in - same difference. I haven't had enough time to tell if this stuff actually works great or not but so far, so good.

The lack of a good arch support is a non-issue for me.  I always remove their insert and use my own custom arch support.	2015-08-06

I had to trim a little to fit in my shoes, and because they do take up room, they only really worked with my more loose-fitting shoes. When I first put them on, I was surprised that they weren't soft. I wore them just a couple of hours the first day, and then a few hours the next and gradually increased to all day. I now keep these in my work shoes & am so thankful for them. I am a nurse & often work 12+ hours shifts. I have high arches & used to change into different shoes every few hours to try and relieve foot fatigue and aches. I was forever wishing I could just kick off my shoes, because I couldn't stand wearing them anymore. My co-workers didn't appear to suffer quite as much as me, but I still thought my troubles were purely down to my work/long hours. Now, I can wear the same pair of shoes for the entire shift & I no longer have that tired feeling. For me, these insoles are a blessing.	2015-08-06

I'm typically a 8 1/2 but I rounded up since they only had whole sizes. The 9 is perfect but that is with the straps pulled as tight as they can possibly go and a bit beyond.

It's a little to tight on the top of my foot heading towards ankle. I wish they had a bigger size for the 10-11. I normally wear a 10 and I am dangerously close to having my heel off the back of the shoe. Other than this the shoe does have a little spring to it when walking. They are hard but the bounce back helps. I wish i could post a pic.	2015-08-06

The first pair I bought were defective, the fabric upper started to come detached from the lower after wearing only 3 times.

I have the worst trouble finding shoes that fit my narrow feet and don't rub my heels. I have found after years of painful shoes that slingbacks are the way to go. This shoe is the only shoe I've found in YEARS that hasn't killed my feet. I am often required to walk over a mile uphill each week in heels, and with any other shoe, I can't walk 50 feet without being reduced to walking barefoot with raw heels, even with moleskin over heel grips, and nylons over bandaids. With these shoes, I can walk around with no problems, and have completely worn down two and a half pairs. That being said, there is a difference between 2A and N (and even 2N). 2A is much narrower, but luckily the first time I wore my newest pair, I was walking around in the rain for a couple of hours (boohoo!), so they stretched out fairly well. Overall, a blessing in the disguise of a shoe. I wish they were still being made.	2015-08-06

I have been wearing these shoes 4-5 days a week every shorts season for 4 years. The shoes outlasted the insoles and I had to get a new pair this year. I have gotten several compliments on their looks, and they have definitely been worth what their price. They are super comfortable. There are days I have walked miles upon miles and my feet didn't feel like it at the end of the day. I wear size 15 or 16 depending on the brand of shoe (these I chose 16) and they are true to length. They do seem a little wider than the New Balance athletic shoes I wear, so if you have a narrow foot, I'd definitely recommend a narrow size. When these wear out, I will be purchasing another pair and would recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable, casual, long lasting shoe.	2015-08-06

They not only fit way too small but when I compared them side by side with other similar Fila brand sneakers they appeared to be a full size smaller.  If you're like me and wear an 11.5, go with the 12.  After the 11.5 sizes, it's only full size increments 12 and 13 after that.  No more half sizes.  I too got them for only $22.00.  I just noticed the price shot up to $55.00.	2015-08-06

Just like other reviewers have said, they fit large (I went down a half size) and have a lot of room in the toe.<br /><br />The toe box ran a bit narrow for a C/D Width shoe but they still fit.<br /><br />I have plantar fasciitis and wear custom orthotics in my running shoes.  I don't like wearing orthotics with tennis shoes since doing so tends to over correct the problem and I end up with an almost twisted ankle.<br /><br />These shoes are great for stability and  absorb impact well.  I've recently tried Nike, New Balance and a non-stabilized Asics tennis shoes and these are by far the best.<br /><br />I wore these out of the box with no break in time and they are great. They also provide excellent control on the court.	2015-08-06

These shoes were comfortable out of the box (wore them around the house yesterday evening, will probably wear them to the County Fair today). I like the smoky silver color. Yes, it's a neutral, but not a boring neutral. I saw at least two other Alegria styles I would like to try, so I will no doubt be purchasing more Alegrias. Except for Clarks, most of my shoes seem to be European brands lately (Birks, Danskos, and now Alegrias). They're usually wide enough, durable (I have had some of my Birks for 15-plus years), comfortable and attractive.	2015-08-06

These are beautiful, and made of high quality leather, but a design flaw keeps them from being perfect. Along the outer edge of the soles, there is a slightly raised bevel that is almost painful if one is walking on uneven ground or does anything to put presser on the outer edges of their feet. Not always noticeably, but it is uncomfortable when it happens. I tried two pairs of these and they were both the same.	2015-08-06

Little feet need to be able to move and mold to the terrain. I always try to find a shoe that has a soft sole but is sturdy at the same time to allow all those little feet muscle to grow strong! Stride Rite is the best when it comes to quality and holding up to the beating little ones do to their shoes. These shoes are the perfect combination of soft yet sturdy sole, and quality that will make it to the hand me down pile for our the next baby girl. We have no problems getting them on and off her feet and the sizing is spot on. Highly recommend!	2015-08-06

I have narrow feet with low arches and it is very difficult to find shoes that fit.  Since I am planning to spend time at the pool for exercise, I needed a slide-on sandal that would stay on my foot when wet.  These are perfect, because the velcro straps allow you to adjust them to fit your feet.  The amount of thick padding placed strategically on the areas that need the most cushioning, including the arches, really surprised me.  I am still wearing them as I  write this  review.  They look sporty -- not a glamorous or cute sandal -- and are well suited to my purpose.	2015-08-06

She wears them all the time b/c she loves that they light up when she walks/stomps.  The polka dot design is very cute.  The product is high quality.  They're a bit pricey but I got them on sale so it helped.  I would DEFINITELY buy these boots again.	2015-08-06

These are the ankle height version of the 415. He uses the 415's for running and working out and the 425's for light hiking.  The 475's are the colder weather version on 415's but with traditional laces. They are all essentially the same shoe with slight differences for specific applications and weather.  He recommends all three of these shoes, depending on how you plan on using them. Adidas did a great job on fit and finish,  as well.	2015-08-06

It fit like it should, no pinching and very comfortable.  The heels measured 3.5 inch high not 3.25 inches as claimed on the listing.  That will not dissuade me from going ahead and wearing these pair of comfortable heels to a very important event anyway. I will def update everyone (after August 11th) if the shoes held up well or not.<br /><br />Update:<br />Wore this to an important event for 6 hours.  The shoes were comfortable but I'm not used to wearing high heels anymore - so short distance walking is OK.  I find the 3.5 inch heel too high for me, maybe I could get away with a 3 inch high heels and be on it for the entire day.  I also wore stockings and the size 9 shoes seems pretty loose, if worn bare - it might have held better.  Cushioning-wise, it made the shoes very comfortable to wear.	2015-08-06

I have fairly flat feet and was looking for improved support in my hockey skates.  The reviews online I read seemed mixed but with their guarantee I decided to give the Superfeet Yellow insoles a try.<br /><br />The Superfeet insoles are simple to use, just sized using footbed from my skates and then slipped into the skate.  Initially I was pleased with the result. Felt my heal was secure in the slightly raised position the insole creates and my blades were even on the ice.  I liked that raised positioning especially when skating backwards.<br /><br />The negative for me was in the knee. After using the insoles for @ 5 sessions I began to get knee discomfort that I did not have previously.  Skated a couple more times in the Superfeet but discomfort continued.  Removed the Superfeet and went back to the original insoles.  Pain went away and has not returned.  But the Superfeet have been....	2015-08-06

It's a great messenger bag, looks fantastic and can carry a lot of things in it without worrying about them. I usually carry my Macbook Air in it's own protection pouch within the bag and it works like a charm. Can get quite a few books and notebooks in there too. It's ideal for a college student that wants something a little different. The real buckles are great makes it feel more secure compared to clip ons.  Make sure you spray it so it keeps its look.

I've been looking for an inexpensive tote bag and tried a &#34;vegan leather&#34; version but just couldn't get over the plastic feel and smell, so I went on the hunt for a deal on a simple leather tote. I prefer the unfinished look, but wasn't looking to spend $100-$200 on a Madewell or Baggu leather tote just yet. That's when I found this bag.<br /><br />Besides having the exact look and feel I was going for, it also included an organizer. Since most of the bags in this unfinished and simple style lack anything more than a small zippered pouch inside, I had pretty much decided I would need to buy an organizer on my own at some point. This bag just worked that problem out for me. I don't need a lot of pockets, just someplace to put my phone where it's easily accessible and a pocket for my pepper spray and pocket knife. Everything else I keep in smaller bags. All my stuff fits nicely in this bag and it's half the weight of the Madewell satchel I've been carrying, so my neck and back are already thanking me.<br /><br />The leather seems to be nice quality and it definitely smells and moves like top-notch leather. I purchased the coffee color because I generally wear all black and I love the way this color looks with that aesthetic. The color is true to the photo so there were no surprises there. The strap drop length is just fine and about average for this type of bag (~9.25&#34;). I do think the bag is smaller than what the product description says, though. I measure it to be about 16&#34; wide, 10.5&#34; tall, and 4.5&#34; deep. I guess if you take out the little piece at the bottom of the purse that keeps it structured you add another few inches to the height, but overall the dimensions on Amazon are incorrect. I would have preferred to receive a bag closer to the size in this item's description, but I find the actual size to be manageable as well so I'll keep the bag. The seller should definitely correct the dimensions in the description, though.<br /><br />I will report back if there are any issues, but overall I'm very satisfied with the bag. I may even come back for a black version as well. Time will tell. I really would like a larger tote, though, so maybe I'll look out for when this brand creates a larger size.<br /><br />*Note: The below photos were taken under somewhat harsh lighting. The leather isn't *quite* as shiny as it appears in the photos. It's a nice pebbled leather with some gloss. Nothing too polished.br /><br />I will report back if there are any issues, but overall I'm very satisfied with the bag. I may even come back for a black version as well. Time will tell.

This is my second pair of these shoes so that should tell you something .

I bought a pair of Vasque Snowblimes for the winter and was looking for a non insulated, water proof pair for warm weather. These fit the bill. There was basically no break in period. They were comfortable out of the box. I use them primarily as a chore boot around the horse farm. They are rugged and comfortable enough for all day wear. Feet stay dry in the tall wet grass and in the mud. The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have is the top quick lace hook is even with the tp of the tongue and the laces slip off behind the tongue - I remedied that by lacing the top hooks and then going down to  lower set of hooks. This works great!	2015-08-06

I wanted to love these shoes. When you first put them on, the inside is so soft, you'll think they're going to be your dream shoe. You walk around your house few a few minutes, they still seem great, so you grab your bag and head out. That's when it all goes wrong. I live in New York, so I do a good deal of walking. I know not every shoe is comfortable at first, but this morning, I hadn't made it two blocks before I looked down and realized my toes were BLEEDING from the strap across them cutting in. I had to stop, pull out my emergency bandaids so I didn't bleed all over my shoes, then hobble back home. Again, this was after two blocks. The strange part is, the shoes aren't even tight. If anything, I'd say the lean on the wide side, so I was shocked that the straps could dig in this way. These shoes are super cute, and if you try them on, you'll want them. But if you walk any distance as part of your day (ie more than a block), don't do it. Shoes you can't walk in, no matter how cute, simply aren't worth it.	2015-08-06

Thanks to all the great reviews I selected a youth size 3 in these shoes.  I typically wear a 4 US or 34-35 European size.  The purple patent is fun yet polished to wear with scrubs.  The strap over the shoe is a bit snug at first but I secured it further up on the velcro and its loosening up nicely over time.<br />I wore these straight out of the box for 8hours with no issues.	2015-08-06

They're more secure than open ankle sandals, although it took me some getting used to that you can't just slip these on/off (need to sit down). They're easy to put on though. Try not to get them too dirty. They're washable but the cloth does tend to go off white quickly if you're not careful. I've gotten compliments. I'd say these run a half size small because I normally wear a 11 but my true size is 10.5 (most retailers just don't care that size) and these just fit me.	2015-08-06

When we found this one she was so excited to get it. It shipped in less than the designated amount of time, which was nice, but the size and quality are poor. It will be a VERY tight squeeze during the school year with school supplies, lunch box, etc. It would be better suited for a preschooler who doesn't have to carry much. I can't believe that older girls would find this backpack useful for all of the things that teenagers have to carry around. It has an odd smell(which they do address on the obviously foreign written information card-broken English and hard to decipher). I would never buy this item again, and am anticipating having to buy another backpack anyway, as their return policy is practically non-existent. Disappointed customer.	2015-08-06

After reading some of the reviews about this shoes I was worried about ordering them. I'm soooo glad I ordered them anyway. I ordered my normal size 6. Fits perfectly. (I sometimes have to go up a half size in a flat and down a half size in a high heel) They are lovely shoes and look very well made. The first day I've worn them I've managed to have them on all day with no rubbing and no breaking in being necessary. As with most pointed shoes I was worried that they would pinch my toes but these shoes do not pinch at all. I can't say enough about how well padded and squishy soft the footbeds are in these shoes!!! I feel like i'm walking little clouds.<br />My only gripe if I can even call it a gripe is that the strap across the top of the foot is oddly long. My feet have a very high bone on top so most of the time I have problems with a mary jane strap being too tight. I would have to put these in the tightest hole for them to be snugly secure around my foot which leaves a long tab...so I just wear them on the 2nd hole to keep the tab from looking too long. It doesn't bother me that they aren't skin tight across the top of my foot. The strap is more for decoration anyway. The width of these shoes feels very medium. There is a bit of toe cleavage even at the pinky as they have a low vamp. I'm going to order them in other colors because they are a perfect shoe to wear if you have to walk around for a day. I received 3 compliments on them in one day!!! They are really beautiful little flats and I highly recommend them.	2015-08-06

The clutch arrived on time and packaged  well with tissue around it and sealed.  Color was fine.  Upon closer inspection I noticed a frayed spot on one of the front pleats. It looks like maybe a machine did it while it was being sewn. How disappointing because it looks elegant and will hold many items for the evening. I will need to buy some fray check at the fabric store and try to repair before my daughter's wedding so that it doesn't become larger.	2015-08-06

Ordered half size up (9.5 up from 9) and they were difficult to hold on my feet- it took an effort to keep them on my feet as I walked. Otherwise quite comfortable. Sometimes the &#34;city flat&#34; style with the elasticized rubs, but not here. Your feet WILL sweat because the lining is a totally non absorbent plasticky material. Returned for a 9 and they were incredibly tight!! The elastic digs into my heel and the toe box is too short. Crazy amount of size difference for half a size! This is really disappointing, because the pattern is cute, the sole is comfortable, and I really wanted to like them. I would suggest trying on the pair you want to buy in person.	2015-08-06

I don't run, but wear them working in a hospital.  The only negative is the cut out for my medial malleous (inside ankle bone) rides high and hits the bone making it necessary to lace the shoe loosely at the top.  I've owned 6-8 other Zoot shoes and have never had this issue.  Overall, still a good value for a comfortable and cushy shoe.	2015-08-06

His feet burn so badly at night that he cannot sleep.  We have tried many different things, and at this point, his life is being negatively impacted because of how tired he is each day at work.  I bought these for him after doing some research hoping that wearing these all day would do the trick.  He works on his feet most of the day on concrete floors.  At first he was excited, but after the third and fourth day of wearing them, he came to me upset because he said his feet have never felt worse.  The last couple of nights have been his worst in a while.  I am pretty sure I cannot return these since he has worn them for a few days.  Very upset that I spent $110 on shoes that hurt him more than any other.  We will try something else!	2015-08-06

Now that I'm retired my husband and I are going to do longer hikes but my old boots cause problems (toe cramping) if I'm out for longer than two hours. I've tried at least six other brands of hiking boots and these fit me the best. When wearing shoes size 9 is the largest I wear, but for these boots, size 10 ended up fitting best.The toes on my left foot do touch when going downhill, but I have been lacing them tight around the ankle for descents and that has helped.  I've hiked as long as seven hours in these puppies and am grateful for the supportive and lightweight boot. And they look good.	2015-08-06

I enjoy the large frame of the sunglasses. These sunglasses are very stylish and very comfortable to wear. They come with a nice little pouch to keep them inside to protect against scratches.

It fit as expected.<br /><br />These are NOT steel toe boots.  The 'hard toe' advertised is only a bit harder than the rest of the boot, and I am sure if steel toe is required, you will get in trouble if you try wearing these.  I know of a supervisor that will step on toes to see- if this toe gets stepped on, it will hurt.  I can mash it down with my thumb.<br /><br />These shoes are lighter than they look - each one weighs a bit less than a pound by my scales (0.912lb) which is about the same as my tennis shoes.  I'm sure smaller sizes will weigh less, but I have a great big foot and often boots like this will be heavy.  These are not.<br /><br />Like:<br />- good tread, with plenty of traction on the sole<br />-1 inch heel that feels flat to wear<br />-soft cuff at the top, padded tongue<br />-looks really cute- great with jeans, the contrasting white stitching looks very nice<br />-I find them comfortable- they are a medium width that is a bit roomier than normal<br />-the body of the shoe seems fairly well constructed.  They'd compare to shoes found at Megamart B&M or Payless stores.<br /><br />Downsides<br />-the insole will come out when I take these off, it is not glued down.  It is flat, and plain, and I'll probably replace it with something better.<br />-all man made materials<br />-not steel toe, toe is only a bit harder than the rest of the boot, NOT safe for jobs that demand steel toes<br />-this material is prone to wear shiny- it looks like suede, but it is man-made.<br /><br />Overall, a nice looking attractive, lightweight but warm boot for school, hiking, or casual wear.  Might be appropriate for many workplaces but not ones that require steel toe boots-I took a star off for that.  The value for price to quality is about average, and the fit is on target.  The boots are Made in China.	2015-08-06

I wasn't sure of the size so I got a 10 and an 11.  The 11 was too long. The 10 is better  I think a 10-1/2 would have been perfect but 10 is fine.  I will say this.  I have a narrow (AA) foot so I can't  wear a lot of Medium width shoes.<br /><br />These shoes fit like a AA.  They are very narrow so if you are a true Medium, this should is not for you.  The arch support is fantastic. I have plantar fasciitis and can never get a shoe with enough arch support.  This rubber shoe has it all.  It's actually the first time that my arches are not falling in.<br /><br />I'm going to get another pair,  probably black, and wear them a few days to see how they might fare on vacation in October.	2015-08-06

Cannot believe it's not leather.  It looks and feels so much like leather.  It's not too big or too small and it's the right size.  It was very light and holds a lot of stuff.  I used it for the first time today and it was very comfortable and I loved it.  I took one star away because it came with an awful smell and I had to put it in front of a table fan and air it out for several days.  Even now it still has a slight smell, hopefully it will go away.	2015-08-06

I bought these online without having tried them on anywhere else, so it was a bit of a risk.  I had been wearing Cherokee Pamela, but the top part of their shoe was hurting my feet across the top after a few hours.  This shoe is extremely comfortable & the top part is soft enough it doesn't leave an indentation on the foot.  I've received numerous compliments for the appearance of the shoe because most of my coworkers wear Danskos, a shoe I refuse to purchase because they're so expensive & I don't like the idea of my heel slipping all day.  My only &#34;con&#34; is that I've been wearing them for about 3 weeks & they're still pretty squeaky.  I wear a size 7.5 but I bought an 8 because I wear thicker, wool socks & the fit is great!	2015-08-06

I wear a size 9 normally in BedStu boots. The 9 1/2 fit perfectly in these. They are snug width wise but not uncomfortably so. They gave in to my foot right away. If you plan to wear heavy socks you might want to try a full size up? There aren't enough positive adjectives in the English vocabulary to describe these! Awesome about covers it though. They are stunning. They feel like a pair of your old favorite shoes right out of the box. The leather is soft and flexible. The color is rich and beautiful. They are well made. The craftsmanship is total artistry. I have Frye boots that cost way more and pale in comparison to these. Thanks Amazon for a great shopping experience and your Prime second day delivery.	2015-08-06

They are fantastic travel shoes. Lightweight, fold nearly flat, easy to slip off for security, and comfortable to wear all day on a wide variety of surfaces. Plus, made with stretchy bands, they adjust to travel swollen feet. That said, I found this style ran a size smaller than all the others, and I had to return for one size up. For shoes this useful, and with free returns, I didn't mind the swap required. A great product.	2015-08-06

If youre worried about size i would stick to your true size. Im a ten and these fit amazing.	These fit as expected. I'm a size ten and its extremely hard to find shoes that are cute and let alone in my size. Needless to say I like throw on casual shoes and these pretty much fit the bill. Love the cut outs and the material seems sturdy enough. No slipping/blistering/ouchness. One criticism is if don't like flat shoes do not buy these. My feet can definitely take a beating (I don't own a car) and I can say that even I thought these were a tad thin. Love them and will continue to use.   Update** I recently just bought these and literally just unwrapped them. Last time I bought the black and they were true to color. This time I debated for a while over the brown and the nude color. First of all the nude to me looks like a pale pink, when thy are in fact a more camel color in person.... A little disappointed right off the bat but other than that still love these shoes!	2015-08-06

Don't get me wrong, this is a great sandal from a fantastic shoe maker BUT I had expected the &#34;upper&#34; - meaning the parts of the shoe that go over the foot - to be leather. It is not. The &#34;upper&#34; material is listed on the box as &#34;Birko-Flor&#34; which appears to be fancy, German-shoemaker-speak for faux leather. Feels like vinyl on the outer-facing side; feels like polyester felt or faux wool on the inside that comes into contact with your foot. Very comfortable, but am wondering how the faux leather is going to hold up over time. The footbed-liner - meaning the part of the foot your foot sits on - is actually leather. A final note about the color: &#34;Graceful Toffee&#34; is a glossy, metallic brown. It looks like glossy mid-value brown indoors, but outside, in the sunlight, it looks more metallic, like a warm bronze. Very pretty, but did I mention it's not leather??	2015-08-06

Review is for the &#34;natural&#34; colour. The star rating is for the actual look and fit of the shoe, not for the seller.  I'm a size 7.5 to 8, but I'm glad I went with the 8 since the shoe is somewhat on the narrow side in the toe area. Lengthwise, there is some space in the front even though I had to attach those soft heel backs since I blistered after wearing them for just 20 mins, both heels.  The shape of the shoe is really nice and looks great with drapey pants, skirts, and jeans. Can be dressed up or down which makes it a very versatile pair of shoes.  My only complaint is that the pattern looks a little different on both shoes, but I think (to an extent) that's just part of the material. It's not super noticeable, but one of the shoes does have more prominent white spots on the vamp. The left shoe actually looked damaged on closer inspection, but I covered the scuffs with a permanent marker. Couldn't complain too much because of the price. The price was good and I had already worn them out in a rush before I realized so I'm stuck with them, but I'm kind of glad I didn't get to return them because the look of the shoes is great.  Also, the pattern didn't have the zig zag-ish look. It's just more of a spotted look.  Overall  - great versatile shoe -slightly on the narrow side, but great lengthwise - shoemetro (seller) should inspect their stock more closely before shipping. If I had paid more, I would've been very disappointed. But I made do with a permanent marker	2015-08-06

That said, FL brand shoes are not cheap, so each pair I buy needs to meet some high expectations. Well, I tried these on and unfortunately didn't find this style as comfortable as my FL wedges (this pair lacked arch support). I could've forgiven that if these shoes looked really good, but the upper strap looked too big and was too loose, even if buckled to the last hole, and didn't look flattering on my feet at all. For the amount of money I paid, it's not worth it so I am sending back. Thank the heavens for Amazon Prime and free returns.	2015-08-06

I bought them because they looked pretty substantial and I thought they would protect my feet. I am a bike patroller and I also thought they would be good for hiking around in the back country to provide first aid. What I found was the shoes are very heavy, clunky and poorly made. I have only had the shoes for about three months and one of the buckles has already broken making the shoes useless until I can get the buckle replaced. If there was a rating lower that 1 that is what I would select. Don’t waste your money.	2015-08-06

I received this product at a discount for an honest, unbiased review.  Just received this sunglasses today.  I was a bit skeptical buying sunglasses online but previous customers said they were good so I gave them a whirl.  I'm glad I did because they are of great quality at a decent price.  I am not a person who is willing to spend over $50 so these were perfect.  I love the quality of the rims, doesn't feel like cheap plastic.  They also come with a nice case and a lens wipe.  The glasses themselves I give 5 stars and stand by it.  It is also nice that they have the measurements online so I could compare to other glasses I have to see if they would be too big/small for my face.  The only negative thing I have to say is about the case, wish it was smaller because if I put it in my purse it would take up the majority of the room.  Other than that, highly suggest them.	2015-08-06

Plenty of room for bills and coins...you do have to fold the bills in half to fit, but having my wallet this organized is so worth it. I plan to get some for gifts...and I LOVE the colors. I carry a very small purse, and it fits perfectly. If you are taking a clutch, it may not fit so easily, but I don't even own one, so this suits me just fine.	2015-08-06

It has so many pockets but still does not manage to &#34;push&#34; everything out like its poochy. I like the slender look to this messenger style bag. Its smaller then my baby bags or Veras I have had and I like that since it does not look like a &#34;mom bag&#34;.<br />I can easily still put a pull up and wipes in one section and no one is the wiser!<br /><br />I can take all sorts of things in the bag from cosmetics, wallet, iPhone, keys, papers, diapers, etc. Its easy to clean if something gets on it too!<br /><br />I highly suggest and will be purchasing others in other colors/designs.	2015-08-06

Note: The shoe that is pictured at the current time is not and InStride &#34;Rambler&#34; according to their website.  (http://www.instrideshoes.com/shoes.asp) It is a &#34;Cascade.&#34;  I didn't want the Rambler after seeing the manufacturers website but took a chance ordering them.  I got exactly what's pictured, &#34;The Cascade&#34; which I believe is a more expensive shoe.. Either way, these shoes are awesome!  I got them in a 12 XW and I have a big foot (width and height) and require good arch support as I am a big guy.  Wide and X-Wide shoes hardly ever fit properly.. My feet were so happy from the moment I put them on.  They are a heavy shoe.. The leather is nice and thick.  I believe they will last a long time.  They also have some removable inserts if you need more room.  I did not have to remove all of them.  Thank you!

I wear an 8/8.5 in most shoes. Anxious that these would run small, I erred on the side of safety and ordered an 8.5. I ended up returning them. I reordered both an 8 & 7.5 to try. The 8 slipped at the heel when I tested them out. The 7.5 fit perfectly. After finally figuring out which size would suit me the best, I must say these are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on! I would suggest ordering at least a half a size smaller than you usually wear.	2015-08-06

First off this purse is so darn cute and seems to have a decent amount of room for most of the stuff I carry. Be aware the concealed carry pocket barely accommodates my Springfield XDM9 with 13 round magazine (extended magazine - 19 rounds will not fit). This is a medium length barrel gun and it's kind of a tight fit, This purse will probably not hold a full length gun.  My Ruger LCR fits just fine, so if you carry a compact or sub-compact firearm you should be OK. If you carry a full size this might not be  the purse for you. He also bought me another purse (slightly more subdued - black and white instead of hot pink) from amazon that has a diagonal zipper for the concealed carry pocket and this type handles the Springfield with the extended magazine just fine, and will most likely accommodate a full size gun. Good luck!	2015-08-06

The picture is inaccurate.  The little screws on the front of the glasses that look innocuous in the picture - are bright and shiny, almost looking like sequins. To me the blue looks grey in the picture but it really is a light blue.  I will enjoy them but I will be gun shy about buying more.	2015-08-06

I have another pair of Aerosoles, which were about 1/2 size too small.  So, I ordered up 1/2 size in these, just in case, and they're still a bit snug!  Should've ordered up a whole size.

They are inexpensive and colorful AND they are a fashion shoe. This means they aren't the very best construction or quality. For instance, the lace holes in the shoes aren't metal grommets but punched holes. Still, they are comfortable. I can wear these all day since I sit at work and stand in them for an hour but I doubt they will provide support to anyone wanting to wear them for 8-9 hours while standing.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I'll be ordering more as back up :)	2015-08-06

TOO long and therefore the toe insert causes huge discomfort. I have owned a beige pair of Kairos and not bothered by the toe divider, in fact I prefer it (also wear 5-toe sandals) and the length/fit of these Papillio are different....the 40 appears/feels/is longer then my originals )-: The leather portion of Zebra is absolutely beautiful so disheartened that the fit is off. But the placement of that toe divider (thong) is critical to the comfort of the sandal. Have been finding that fits of not only shoes but clothing can vary - even if it is the same style of shoes/boots or cut of clothing. Think the manufacturers bid out to other manufacturers to build/construct/cut/sew their products and the final product can then vary - which is disappointing. So overall - appearance - beautiful; fit - for me, bad.	2015-08-06

My usual size was much too large and the next size down was much too small.  The smaller size in a wide might have worked but wide options are not available for this shoe. I was sad to return them because this is a beautiful shoe.  The detailed cutouts make for a really nice look and the footbed seems supportive enough for all day wear.  I might have been able to make this shoe work for me in spite of imperfect fit if the toe opening had been a little larger--my toes really didn't show at all and were pinched together.	2015-08-06

I took a chance and ordered my usual size, 6.5, even though a lot of the reviews said they run small.

Having basically the same slipper in the regular, flat style (not wedge), I purchased the same size; however, the wedge style is much narrower overall, especially at the toe, which is also more pointed at the tip than the flat style. My toes barely fit on the toe bed - I have wide feet. Having said that, I kept it because I think the next size up will be too long past my heel. They are as comfortable as the flat style and are slightly dressier because of the wedge. My foot slips a little forward while walking since the slipper is higher at the heel, but not so much as to jam between my toes.  The straps are narrow and flattering, compared to the flat style I recently purchased (which has wider straps that the original ones I was replacing). I don't think I can ever wear slippers not made out of yoga mats ever again.	2015-08-06

I am a big fan of Salomon boots,trail and running shoes and have been for 10 years plus. I started out trying out a pair of Salomon running shoes primarily because I prefer NOT to have conventional laces that require tying and flop around relentlessly. Those shoes were a big hit with me and I have been buying Salomon shoes ever since and I still have that very first pair plus ten additional pairs to keep them company. I have very wide feet  (10 EE) and typically run into problems with toe box comfort and for the most part, my fat feet have been accommodated quite well with Salomon shoes and boots with the exception of a couple Gore-Tex models that squeezed my feet  so much that I can only wear them for an hour at a time. Even though Salomons are manufactured in China , the quality has been superb and I will continue to buy them.....same size , different styles and colors though.	2015-08-06

Again, I couldn't go without so I ordered both the black and brown Reefs; they came perfect in packaging, shipped right on time, and were true to the colors on the screen. I read the prior reviews and many mentioned the size runs small. I'm so glad I read the other reviews as I ordered size 9 and they fit perfect, just a tad bit snug. I usually wear size 8 in any other brand of flip flops. Vaguely, I remember Reefs in stores also running smaller in size so I believe it's a brand thing. You won't be disappointed, just remember order a size up!	2015-08-06

US	38286813	R3J9Q3YICGZ2E8	B002Y4IG7Y	355629030	Birkenstock Unisex Birko Sport Arch Support - Sport	Shoes	4	20	20	N	Y	Experiment with different shoes	In the past 5 years I have most likely spent about $300 on arch supports.  Yes, I have flat feet.  I got these today and they appear to work rather well.  Much better than 90% of the ones I have tossed out or are in my drawer waiting to be tossed out.  As an amateur expert on these things let me suggest a few ideas.<br />I prefer full shoe inserts.  The half ones have a certain logic in terms of giving your toes more room, but the ball of your foot and inner pad also need support.  These are the full length.  These are unusual to me because they have a hard bottom shape and a soft rubber top.  They seem awkward at first, but after wearing them most of the day I noticed a real sense of support in a pair of basketball shoes.<br /><br />If you are still with me I have some buying suggestions.  Look at the shoes you plan to put these into and use the euro number - not the American size.  Your shoes may have a range so pick something in the middle.  Buy the one that best describes your foot - high arch, normal or flat.  Here is the &#34;secret&#34;.  This insert will fill up the shoe or sneaker near the toes and  push the foot up into the top of the shoe. Most of them do this.  Don't wear inserts with jammed up feet.  Next:  if you don't have shoes that handle full inserts go to a discount store with name brands at a discount. This is what I do. Take the inserts with you. Tell the clerk.  Now, start trying on different designs without and with the insert.  Find the design and size that allows room for your toes and the top of your foot.  Cramming your feet into a shoe is never a wise thing.<br /><br />I got lucky and found a pair of gray basketball sneakers that accommodated the insert and my foot!  Gees!  What a difference.  I have a pair of boots with high toe room, but I could not remove the glued insert in the boot.  No good.  Another pair of basketball shoes also did not work.  But, the ones that worked did allow me to remove their insert and replace it with this one.  Voila!  I have a most comfortable pair of shoes.<br /><br />Over the years I have visited a podiatrist twice - completely useless visits.  He would recommend some sort of happy feet stuff or other. He was useless.  Experiment around.  I will say that I have been wrong to expect too much.  It is critical to be picky about having reasonable comfort.  In my experience if the shoe feels comfortable in the store, it will work.  I hate it when someone says, &#34;Oh, those will stretch.&#34;  Naaa!<br /><br />Yes, you may have to compromise on style and color.  The objective is to have comfortable feet.  If you do have foot problems I have had great help from exercise.  Hold onto 10 lbs and hang your heals out over a board or step.  then raise and lower yourself on the balls of your feet.  This has certainly helped my balance and walking.  There is no free lunch. Compromise.  If your feet are not comfortable, keep working at it.  One of the most ugly pair of cross trainer sneakers I owned had the best darn arch support. comfort wise they were great.  Hardly fashionable looking.  No, I did not wear them with a tuxedo.  For working out they were awesome until they completely rotted out. Nike stopped making them!!!! so much for great design and lousy look.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br /> A Week Later - Fantastic.  The soles have settled into my basketball work out sneakers and my feet are far more comfortable. I have great stability.  My plan is to follow my own directions above and get another pair of sneakers.  These supports really work for me.e.  Voila!

The holes in the strap are supposed to fit over a little round peg on each side of the purse, but the holes are too small. There's a little slit there, and I still can't get the strap on. Unfortunately, the straps that you see in the picture are not long enough to be able to carry it as a shoulder bag. I might have kept it, however, and cut the slits a little bit so the shoulder strap would attach, but the bag's quality is not what I expected either. It looks beautiful in he picture, but the leather is not nearly so nice in reality. It seems to have some sort of lacquer over it. Makes it look, frankly, like faux leather. Sadly (I was really looking forward to its arrival), I&#34;m sending it back.	2015-08-06

These pumps are great for work - they have a low enough heel to be comfortable but are higher than a &#34;kitten heel&#34;, so they still give the high heel look.  I had a pair in black that I wear all the time so I decided to get the nude as well.  I only gave 4 stars rather than 5 because the &#34;nude&#34; is very, very light, and appears more tan in the picture.  I was hoping for a deeper nude as pictured, but I'm still happy with these for the summer months.	2015-08-06

I think my feet might be a bit too wide, or my step isn't centered because occasionally my toes touch the ground. I'm a 7.5 so I ordered a 7, thinking they might stretch a little, but the sole was way too small. Returned and ordered an 8 and they came in about two days! I love them! I wear them to school all day, but I wouldn't recommend them for long walks as they have no support and the balls of my feet start to hurt. Good for chillin' at a beer garden or going to school in.	2015-08-06

I usually wear an 8 or 8 1/2 and had tried on some Vionic sandles in the store the 8 fit perfectly. With these the toes hit right at the end and were a little wide. The arch also wasn't enough for the high arch I have. So I had to return them without ever wearing them, I only tried them on to walk around for a few minutes.	2015-08-06

I had the exact same brand / style and wore them frequently for a few years.  I searched for a replacement since I like this quality of flip flop so much but could not read the size on my well-worn pair.  l - I normally wear a 6.5 or 7 so I ordered a 7 but it is very likely that my old pair were actually an 8.  I am getting by with the 7 but should have ordered an 8.  These are pricey for a flip flop but have very good support, are comfortable even for moderately long walks, and last a long time.	2015-08-06

I've been eyeing them for a long time, wondering if I could splurge and get a pair of Mephisto's!  I'm disappointed that they aren't offered in a wide width as well, as they do run narrow as some reviewers have said.  I've learned from a previous pair of narrow boots that one pays a heavy price for sticking with a shoe that one hopes to break in.  My feet have never been the same, and I've learned my lesson.  I so hoped they'd fit my feet like a glove, but I don't want to take the chance.  Also, just as an aside, I've noticed these boots are offered on other websites as made in France versus Portugal, where mine were made.  Don't know if that makes a difference, but quality control might be compromised when farming out production.  Thank you for allowing me to get the satisfaction of trying these boots at a reasonable sale price, but I've learned the hard way that you don't mess with fit when it comes to your feet.  These are going back, reluctantly.	2015-08-06

Other reviews led me to believe this would fit a wide foot comfortably - I would say it's just slightly wider than a medium. If I wear thin socks, I can wear it all day without any problem. The arch support and shock absorption are great. Right after I tried them on, I applied a thin layer of talc between the insole and the footbed, and there's been no squeaking.<br /><br />If I bought another pair, I would do it at a store so I could try it on.	2015-08-06

I initally loved these sandals known as Telic/Terox- over time bought 6 pairs! and bought my husband some also...wore them in all colors with outfits--then we both started developing knee pain, and attributed it to many other things- until we discovered we both were wearing the same sandals<br />and a podiatrist said the sandal looked as if it had support- but the cushy-ness negated all support.  Went back to my Dansko and Abeo sandals and all knee pain has vanished.	2015-08-06

When first putting them on, these were the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn.  They were incredibly rigid, provided zero arch support, and there was a lot of extra room in the toe area.  After 8 hours on my feet, I could barely walk.<br /><br />However, once they were broken in, they did gradually become more bearable.  That though, took about a month.  But, once that happened, the tread began peeling from the toe and sides, making it easy to trip.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend these shoes, nor would my union as they also recalled them for the reasons I listed above.	2015-08-06

At this point I have put in 350 miles in Runduros. It's been a great experience to have a pair of shoes that feels like it has just right balance between stability and minimalism.<br />These felt great out of the box, the B.O.A. system is fine, if you are looking for a shoelace feel, stop it. This is a different system and it has its own feel and its tendency is to hug the top of your feet, which works great in terms of leaving plenty of room and feel in the toe box.<br />Most of the miles I've put in my Runduros were on pavement but there were plenty of instances where I used them on trails and the performance was just fine. I have a pair of trail running shoes that I use for long trail runs but the Runduros are great to use on days that I mix both or just on the road.<br />At this point I have clear signs of wear on the soles, they are beginning to feel a bit muted but I think I can probably get close to 500 miles on them (mind you I run at an average cadence of 180-185 which is supposed to help with longevity).<br />What would I change in these?<br />I'm not sure...I really like them and will get a second pair in a few months. I suppose that it would be interesting to know what a lower stack height and slightly softer compound on the sole would do...Although I'd rather try that on a different model as opposed to changing the Runduros and a formula that does what it's supposed to do	2015-08-06

In addition, a few shorter trail hikes were taken while wearing these boots. They provided good support but, more importantly, drained and dried quickly. The boots were not broken in before the trip but, luckily, did not cause any rubbing or blisters, provided good arch support, and were comfortable for the entire time. Of course, the wearer does need to be sure to lace these up properly -- they are not meant to be the kind of shoe that slips on and off.  While these were used on some shorter trail hikes, I would not recommend them solely as a hiking boot. The sole is soft and more flexible than a normal hiking boot. After only about 10 days of not-too-intense use, the rocks have taken a fair number of small bites out of the tread on the bottom of the boot. The tops of the boot are fairly soft and do not provide much toe protection (flexible like the top of an athletic shoe). This flexibility is good in a water boot for walking and balancing on uneven wet surfaces, but was not as welcome on trail hikes. If you have a sore or stubbed toe, you will probably feel like you've re-stubbed it several more times during your trail hike.  I'm giving this 5 stars because it will likely be the Go-To water boot and functioned well for its intended purpose.	2015-08-06

I bought them because I thought they were super adorable, but in all honesty, they didn't look like the kind of shoe that I could comfortably wear all day. Shoes with this many straps have that much more probability of wearing on your skin somewhere, plus the lack of arch support could make them uncomfortable.  So imagine my surprise when I received these and wore them all day on Day 1 with no issue whatsoever.  I still wouldn't say they have great arch support, but it's decent and I find them as comfortable as a good quality pair of flip flops.  They are quality, super classy for casual days, and easy to wear.  I'd highly recommend..<br /><br />Oh, and because sizing discussion always helps with online purchases - I bought a size 8 and I typically wear a size 8 to 8.5, so these definitely run true to size.	2015-08-06

I stand on my feet all day at work and wanted something that would keep my feet comfortable. These shoes provide great cushion, giving your heel a very soft spot to land on. The top portion of the shoe has a thin mesh, which provides good air flow. The only thing that is incredibly odd is that they stick to concrete!<br /><br />I've looked at other reviews and it seems like no one else has mentioned this issue, but the threads of the sole somehow dig into the concrete, causing a velcro-ripping sound with each step. It feels like walking on velcro. I don't understand how that's possible, but it is. Luckily, concrete seems to be the only surface that has this effect. On the bright side, it does provide excellent traction.<br /><br />But velcro-effect aside, the shoe is incredibly comfortably, which is what really matters to me, so I'll still give it the five stars.	2015-08-06

I normally take a 6 1/2, 7, I got these in a 7, and they are too small. I have an older pair without the memory foam in a 7 and they fit perfect.

For what it's worth, these are a must have if you have any feet problems..i.e..plantar fasciitis.  The way they are made helps support the arch and most importantly, the heels of the feet.  I doubted on the style, but these (Spenco Yumi Leather Dark Olive/Khaki) are actually nice and stylish, for me.  They may need adjusting and getting used to them, but without a doubt, these are Heaven to my feet!  Buying another pair tomorrow! ;)	2015-08-06

We have them in gold, white and black just for the flexibility of matching them to outfits. My 6 year old loves them and has asked for more in purple and pink.<br /><br />They are still as durable as I remember. These are not the type you would ever go climbing in, they don't have a great grippy sole, but she has no problem climbing things with them on. They are 100% leather and top quality. We also purchased a more sturdy pair of hiking type of sandals for her and funny those lasted 2 months. But her salt water have withheld the test of time this summer.<br /><br />As long as she wears them next year I will be ordering them again, they are wonderful sandals!	2015-08-06

I walk ~20 miles per week, and these last typically 6 months +/- before I will begin to experience knee pain. I exercise in the white pair, but have owned the black and brown for the office as well.	2015-08-06

It is in my neck, shoulders and back.  It hurts like hell.  Bending over or picking something up and other things hurt. I try not to do them. If I have to get down and pick up something or bend over I often cuss.  Not like me to cuss but it hurts and I wonder if God is going to consider that a sin.  Smile<br />I was sent this shoehorn to review.  It works great.  It is so easy now to put on my shoes and it keeps me from cussing.<br />I recommend this to those with arthritis and for other people that have problems like that...  It is funny how something this simple can make such a big difference in your life.	2015-08-06

Soft rubber nose piece and arm tips were very comfortable. Even after extended wearing the rubber was able to move with my head and big ears preventing a glasses induced headache. The lenses are indeed polarized, not top quality however that's not what you are paying for here. The style is also pretty sweet, I have a fairly large wide head. Most glasses look too small on my face and squeeze the sides of my head, these do not. They also fit my wife and she has a smaller, normal sized head.<br />Day 2 - 3/5<br />The left nose piece started coming off the frame. They are held on with two tabs, and one slipped out of the frame. After pushing it back in 2 dozen times I came to the super glue solution, but never got around to the fix. This isn't too bad because I don't mind a little diy fix, but for a brand new pair of shades is unacceptable.<br />Day 3 - 1/5<br />The frames broke under one of the lenses. I was shocked, taking them off my head and seeing the plastic had separated. Also bummed out, even with the rubber nose piece falling off these are still the most comfortable 20 dollar sunglasses I've ever worn. They had only seen 3 days of what I'll classify as light-normal use. I wore them on my face to sit around a pool, wash cars, etc... nothing too crazy. I don't bang my face onto anything, they never fell off, and went straight into a hard case when not in use. The only explanation I can come up with is maybe they don't like the heat (it was around 112 in the day) and it caused them to self destruct. I hope this isn't the case because I'm still contemplating ordering another pair and hoping the first was defective.<br /><br />Bottom line: At this price point they would be a slam dunk if they had stayed together. Comfort, polarized lens, and style are all the best Ive found for 20 dollars. Unfortunately, mine fell apart. After reading other reviews I may have a defective product. Unless I decide to buy another pair and they produce better results, I cannot give my recommendation for this product.	2015-08-06

No lace locks of any kind, causing the boots to become loose after a few steps. The laces themselves are starting to get tears on them.<br />The worst thing of all is that these boots do not breathe!

I couldn't wait to get these glasses in because in the pictures they looked really cute and a I love Coleman products.  Well they look even better in person and they came is a drawstring pouch for protection. I have a stigmatism in my eyes, so I really need a dark pair of polarized glasses to keep me from squinting and my eyes watering all of the time when I am in the sun. This is a must because I am an outdoorsy kind of girl. These glasses, which I purchased in black and are adorable, they fit my face perfect and they are so light that they do not leave a mark on my nose like most glasses do...and did I mention I look great in them? (Just joking...but I really do like how they look and feel) another great feature that I like and has held up so far...the frames have not stretched when I put them over the top of my big head when entering a store. So when I read that in the description of these glasses that is what prompted me to make the purchase! So many of my glasses have been donated or given to a friend for that exact reason. I recommend these glasses as they are gorgeous and durable.  I received these glasses at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review and like I said these are durable and should last a while as long as your not one of those people that can't keep up with glasses and lose them all of the time.	2015-08-06

When I purchased these shoes, I had read in reveiws that they ran a little small, so I purchased a half size up just to be sure that I got the right fit. The shoes came packaged well, and in new condition as described. I love the teal/green, and it really gives the white shoe and exciting bit of color. The extra bounce in the heel really gives extra support, and I liked that it wasn't a &#34;hard connect&#34; with the pavement when running. The laces are a bit short, so I ended up buying a longer pair to accomodate for the double knot I put in my laces. All in all, if you're looking for a great shoe for walking or unning, and don't mind paying a bit for them, these are great shoes. Just make sure to order a half size up, or you might be stuck sending them back. Thanks!!	2015-08-06

Fit like a glove! I'm a size 6, but from the comments it sounded like everyone was having an issue with the recommended size. I went with size 36 and have no problems with the fit.<br /><br />Definitely do some kind of transition stage if you're not already a minimalist runner. My pinky toes tend to rest almost overlapping the fourth toe, so the first few days I just walked in the shoes - and even that kind of hurt my pinkies. But I understood there would be some discomfort given the kinds of shoes I've been wearing for 20-some years... Just a couple of weeks and my pinky toes are hanging out on their own side of the foot now. Hahaha	2015-08-06

I like these sneakers, they fit true to size (for wide-feet individual). They are simple and fun to wear, yet have interesting twists. I got 2 pairs--one pair in black with snake sprint, silver coating and silver-tone metal mesh on the tongue, and one pair in gold with khaki-like texture upper and snake print, gold coating and gold-tone metal mesh on the tongue. The reason I gave them 4 stars was because, in my opinion, the craftsmanship was OK for me. As you can see in one of my photos, the insole lining does not fit the insole totally, so you could see the stitches exposed. For the fit, for someone who have wide feet like I do, I'd suggest to go with your true sneakers size or 1/2 size down; if you have narrow and slender feet, I'd suggest to go at least 1 size down. For examples, my 6.5M-size shoes (width: 3.25&#34;; length: 9-3/8&#34;) fit me very well and I usually wear sneakers in 7.5M-9M (depending on brands).	2015-08-06

They are really cute. I accidentally ordered a size too large and had to return them. I ended up having to buy them again from another seller in the UK because this seller unfortunately didn't have my size (and ended up getting a size too large again). So, I'm keeping them and I just put an insole in, which was a wonderful idea. One thing though, I have really skinny ankles so the ankle strap is really loose, I fixed this by shortening it with some rubber bands. Once again, these are great and very unique and I cannot wait to wear them for my wedding. I definitely want to buy myself another pair.	2015-08-06

The men's versions always get the good neutral colors. I know that this is one of the older styles but the colors don't get any better. I love this shoe. I have been wearing The One for running and after a year or so, I've compacted the soles. It's a good inch thinner now. It still works well but as I'm picking up more miles, I wanted something with more cushion. I run on pavement. This particular style is a good size and a half smaller than let's say The One and the Torin style. I first ordered in my usual size in Altra which is half a size larger than my conventional shoe size. My toes were basically pushing out of shoes. So I ordered a 5.5 first which usually fits like a 5. But it was way too small. I opted to try the 6.5 as it's the only other size left. And I'm so happy they fit! I've seen the newer versions of this shoe and it's no longer as wide. I really need the shoes to be wider as I really like having my toes splay.	2015-08-06

I had to use moleskin for some blisters but I expected that without properly breaking them in.  They were breathable and comfortable.  Fit as expected.  We will see how they last through the whole season.	2015-08-06

I've been wearing Birkenstock sandals for 20 years because of bilateral heel spurs.  Over the years, I've amassed a collection of approximately 100 pair in various styles, colors and patterns.  My latest obsession is florals.  I was excited to find the &#34;Suki&#34; in my size and ordered it immediately.  My excitement was a bit dashed upon arrival because it appeared that my &#34;new&#34; sandals had been worn, given the toe imprints on  each footbed.  My choices were either keep the sandals, or return them with no option for replacement.  As I am completely aware that you can't have a bad day when you're wearing pink blossoms on your feet, I opted to keep the sandals.  But, the imprinted footbed resulted in a reduction of two stars.	2015-08-06

These are really cute; tho listed as &#34;Womens&#34;, they aren't sized for women.  I even looked on the Converse site, and it said that these run &#34;true to size.&#34;  I ordered a size 6, and they were Mens 6.  A size 4 would have been what I needed, if they are true to size.  I have unisex canvas Chucks which Converse recommends going a 1/2 smaller, and that worked out well.  They are size 3.5.  I also have a pair of Women's canvas studded hi tops that ordered in 5.5, and the bottom of shoes the says 3.5.<br /><br />Bottom line: Return polices are important when ordering Converse online.	2015-08-06

I bought these thinking they'd be good for an upcoming vacation that will involve a lot of walking. Good thing I tried them out at home first. The memory foam is super comfy, but I can't say the same for the rest of the shoe. The back rubbed against the back of my heel in a really uncomfortable way, despite the fact that I was wearing socks. I only wore them around the office, but by mid-day I was putting bandaids on my heels to prevent blisters. Heel grips might make these tolerable, but come on.

I have only had these boots for a couple months, but so far so good.  I am a land surveyor and am always on my feet, wlaking/trekking through all types of terrain. Whether it be concrete, dirt, or brushy hillsides, the aggressive vibram sole and very cushy insole keep my feet comfortable.  They don't get hot, even in triple digit weather, walking in asphalt.  Despite the composite toe, they are a bit heavy.<br /><br />The only advice I have is to not pull the laces too tight through the lowest hooks as this pinches my feet and irritates them; however doing so with the remaining upper 2 pairs of hooks is fine. I found thst doing this makes for the best fit of the boot.<br /><br />For the extremely competitive price, it'd be bery difficult to find a Gore-Tex lined, Vibram sole, composite safety toe, memory foam/extra cushioned heel insole boot anywhere.  Given, the price reflects a boot made in China rather than the US.  We'll see how the boot holds up after a year or so.	2015-08-06

These shoes fit perfectly…and I have a hard to fit foot. My foot is wide, needs support, and I HATE having to bend over to tie a shoe lace at the most inconvenient moment. These shoes not only feel great and met ALL of my requirements, but they surprised me by looking really good, too, in person. I thought they would be really sporty, but these shoes will actually be perfect for casual Fridays. You have to look twice to see that they are sneakers. I guess I should have figured that out by the name &#34;Fashion Sneaker&#34;, but I was too excited about the Amazon Deal of the Day price that I paid to pay too much attention to the name. :-)  They are comfortable and hug the foot just right without being too tight. These are great for a casual walk around the mall, going to a ballgame, or, like I said, a casual Friday at work. Hmmm I just might try to sneak (pardon the pun) these sneakers in on a busy Monday, too.	2015-08-06

Bought to perhaps take on Camino this summer, but I'm glad I decided against them, as I needed something stiffer and more padded. The quick laces are easier to use than some others I've had. This color is very bright, so be prepared for people to look at your shoes, not eyes. My only complaint is that there is a tiny bit of fuzzy looking frayed nylon on inner top corners of both shoes, right by the laces, as if they had repeatedly rubbed against each other. This happened after only a few uses, and there was no rubbing of any sort! Very light shoe and roomy toe box. Would buy again at right price.	2015-08-06

They have absolutely no arch support at all.  None.  In fact they may actually sink in along the arch of the foot. The other people wearing these must have flat feet or they soon will if they can wear them at all. They are much bigger and wider than any other sandal I've tried so far, but that isn't a good thing for sandals since you want them to fit enough to not slip around when walking to avoid blisters and protect your feet.<br /><br />Because of the lack of arch support my heel and toes feel like they are stepping on some other raised parts of the shoe which feels weird.  Obviously, your mileage may vary, but these sandals should only be sold at the dollar store, 2 for 1 most days.	2015-08-06

It's been a long time since I could find these moon boots.  I used to wear them when I was pregnant because they were so comfortable, I could wear them all day even with my feet swelling.  When I was surfing around looking for slippers I came across this product and made my purchase.  I've been wearing them around the house and even to go check my mail at the post office, a block over.  They are comfortable while providing a sole so it's the next best thing to being barefoot but with protection.  I wanted to make sure these were the same ones I used to buy when I was pregnant, and they are so I'll be making more purchases of them.	2015-08-06

The fact that they're too big is my own fault, really--there wasn't a size 9 available, so I took a chance on the 9 1/2. It is, indeed, a bit too big, so I can't exactly run in them. However, they were comfy enough to traverse two airports in, and a TSA lady complimented them the first day I wore them. They are a little wide on me, as well, but my feet are slightly narrow.	2015-08-06

No longer good!<br />I thought I was going crazy, because I had been wearing these shoes for years and years and loved them, always had a pair or sometimes two handy for when the old pair's life was ending, and suddenly the same size didn't fit at all and my feet got extremely smelly and sweaty while wearing them. My old pair still fit and so did other shoes, so it had to be the shoes. But reading these reviews I know that it isn't me... Do not buy these shoes! Bad about this website: I was just chatting with an employee to ask about this issue before reading theses reviews and he told me that nothing changed when I literally asked about it. So that is no way to treat a customer, it's basically a lie... They should be honest about this change, they cheapened the production, making this a bad shoe, not what you could get before.<br />To top it off, I sent in this review at the Reebok website before and it was turned down for not meeting their standards. I checked, nope, it's up to standard alright. I guess Reebok is not into honest criticism? So submitting this review to amazon and other places now, I mean I took the time to write it...	2015-08-06

This is the first lifting sneaker I have purchased.  It has changed by world!  I absolutely love it.  I usually wear a 9-9 1/2 depending on the sneaker/brand and after reading the reviews I decided to go with the 9 1/2.  I'm glad I did becuase it fits perfectly (borderline snug - but I think the 10 would have been to large).  I also have a wider foot, so I was nervous about that after reading some reviews saying that the sneaker was narrow, but the width was perfect!<br /><br />After the first time wearing them I noticed a big difference in the balance I had for lunges, pistols, split squats, etc.  They are light-weight, comfortable and I absolutely love the colors.  I would buy a pair in the blue if they had a pair left in my size.  Highly recommended for any weight training, strength training - but I wouldn't recommend to wear for running.	2015-08-06

Picture makes the shows look more on the grey side or charcoal side, but do not be fooled they ate indeed a very rich black. I'm usually a size 11.5 or 12 depending on the shoe but I heard they run big so I I order an 11, but these definitely run a size big AT LEAST. I probably could have easily gotten away with wearing a size 10.5. But none the less I love them. I only give it 4 stars because I can't tell if they are comfy or not or how long they will last. So I'll probably update this later.	2015-08-06

OK, These are by far the best quality sneaker I have ever seen. I'm giving this 5 stars, as it's a great sneaker, However, I had to return, as my daughter's feet are extra, extra wide, and these did not fit. I had no idea her feet were so wide, I'm having such a heard time finding sneaker to fit her. I almost kept these for her young sister, I think they are such a great sneaker. It broke my heat to return them. Geat Classic Sneaker that goes with almost my 2 year old daughter  entire wardrobe.	2015-08-06

I have narrow feet and these shoes leave a sizable gap on either side of my feet, making for a sloppy look. Second, these shoes are really heavy because the entire white bottom section seems to be pure rubber. The combination of the wide fit and heaviness make these constantly flop on my feet while walking so I couldn't keep them.<br /><br />They were comfortable otherwise and looked really cool in person, so if you have wider feet they may work for you.	2015-08-06

I ordered these for myself and I really like them. They fit a little smaller than I had planned but I also have a wide face.<br />These glasses are very light on your face so they want bother your your nose or ears. The part that goes over your ears are a little tight, meaning they don't fold in and out to easy. They almost feel to me that they need some oil.<br />The chrome desgin on the side I thought was going to be metal but it is plastic. The design fits flush with the arms, it doesn't stick out.<br />The lens are polarized and very dark. I love dark lens as my eyes are very sensitive to sunlight. The glasses are extremely comfortable as if you didn't have anything on at all. These glasses have like a cat eye shape over your eyes. Comes with a nice bag to keep them stored in when not in use.<br />Overall I am satisfied with these glasses. I would recommend them, however they are a little pricey for the quality of them.<br />I received this item in exchange for a honest and unbiased review	2015-08-06

These are perfect, I love these. They're just a bit girly, while still being functional.

I have a wide face and big cheeks so sometimes glasses squeeze my face but these don't in the least bit. I have pretty chipmunky cheeks and these manage to make me look decent. These are wonderful and with any set of polarized glasses, when it comes to cleaning them; make sure you're using gentle cleaning products. Nothing harsh, and use a cleaning cloth if it comes with it, if possible. I received these glasses in exchange for a review.	2015-08-06

You would think if you purchased a sandal you could take them to the pool, the lake, or maybe to the beach, slip them off for some fun in the sun.  But you can’t!  When I left them in the sun the heal cup shrunk about 1/4&#34; around the outside.  Now the sandals are uncomfortable to wear and I have to toss them.  I contact Orthaheel/Vionicshoes about my issue and they told me the sandals have a 6mo warranty too bad.  My pair was about 1 year old but not heavy warn.  I explained it is a sandal you should be able to leave them in the sun without it damaging the sandal and rendering them useless.  They just replied back about the 6 mo. warranty.<br />So while a comfortable sandal the company in my opinion as a defect if you cannot leave your sandal out in the sun.  It is an expensive sandal I expected them to last longer and be of better quality.	2015-08-06

Although these are super cute, they don't look or feel like they'd last beyond one cold spell. The material is cheap feeling and it feels like felt. I ordered the small because I wear a 6.5 and the description says small = 6.5 to 7.5 but these are more like a 5.5 or 6. These really are just glorified slippers and should be more of a child or young teen product. The bottom is not designed for a lot of wear and tear which is why they are more like slippers to me.

The shoes are very durable and she has been them all summer regardless of a slight blister she got after wearing them for 2 weeks. She got the blister on the inside of her foot due to them being too tight. (This happened when she was at daycare all day.)  She is 2 and can put them on and take them off by herself. The Velcro makes it easy to do that. (We put a Band-Aid on the blister, she took a break for a few days, and the blister hasn't come back.) So I attribute the blister to them being unaware the shoes were too tight.<br /><br />We plan to buy another pair once she outgrows these ones.

I liked these shoes as something to wear to work, and I work in an office so I'm not walking around in them all day.  They're ok as far as comfort goes, nothing special there.<br /><br />The one thing that I really didn't like is that the strap over the toe actually wraps under the minimal padding of the sole.  Not a big deal at first, until I wore them on vacation where I was walking all day long.  Because the sole of the shoe is a little slippery my feet slid back and forth, which isn't uncommon in heels and not a huge bother, but with the strap underneath the padding you can feel it.  My foot was rubbing on the little bump it causes constantly and I ended up with surprisingly large blisters.  I don't think it's very common for a strap to wrap all the way underneath the padding, at least none of my other shoes are like that, and since the &#34;padding&#34; is practically non-existent it ended up being a huge problem.<br /><br />So I do still wear them around the office but if I know I'm going to be walking more than that I reach for another pair of shoes for sure.	2015-08-06

I found they are true to size and I have wide feet with a bunion.  Yes, they were tough to get off and on the first few times and felt a little snug but only after my third time wearing them they're just perfect and have gotten easier to get on/remove. The pull tabs help me get my feet in a lot.theyve got a nice heel but doesn't feel high and I am able to walk very comfortably in them. They do have a very slick bottom so I'll eventually have rubber put on the bottom of them for better traction, until then I'm not worried. I even purchased the oil-based weatherproof spray by frye for them and despite many of the negative reviews it worked great on these boots. It didn't change the color of the boots at all. All in all, this was a great purchase/investment .	2015-08-06

The ray ban symbol wasn't even in the same spot it was in my real glasses (I have multiple pairs) the logo in the nose piece was upside down, the blue was a different shade, the case had a different material, the clip on front of the case was more of a hard metal than a soft leather like on the original ray ban case.

I was slightly skeptical about purchasing after reading a review where it was stated that the boots were difficult to put on and did not fit as expected.  Against this I purchased my actual size and was very please with the quality and fit.  It kept me very warm and I have only to wear regular socks in downwards of -35 degrees Celsius.  I gave a 4 star rating because the only con was that the outer like of the sole lifted slightly due to my excessive cleaning (using cloth and water).  I would definitely recommend this.

At work, I am on my feet all day and I feel like I'm walking on a cloud.  I was initially turned off by the higher price, compared to Reef (my other favorite) or other brands.  However, I am willing to pay more for the comfort combined with cuteness.  As I said earlier, I wear these to work - they're casual but still somewhat &#34;fancy&#34; in summer months.  I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars because I put a pair of these in my car in case I wanted to change out of my uncomfortable shoes - and THEY SHRUNK!  I've shopped around all summer for replacements, but can't find any suitable.  Therefore - I'm buying another pair - but will never leave them in high temperatures again.  I've traveled with them in a suitcase and not had a problem.  But apparently, the high Colorado heat in my car in springtime was too much.  Be warned but buy anyway!!!	2015-08-06

Felt like they'd be super comfortable. However, the back strap is positioned too far forward, so that even when on the largest hole, it pushed my foot forward and my toes hung over the front edge slightly.

They aren't as tall as I pictured and the pattern does get a little fuzzy around the ankle but that's only if you're really examining them. Nice fit and great quality. The rubber tread on the bottom is nice and thick, very heavy and durable without making the shoes too heavy to wear comfortably. Will be great for school! I did get these at a discount in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-06

I usually wear 8.5-9, and I got the 9 which fits just right.  I ended up getting 2 pairs - Fleur Pink & Black - and it's rare for me to like any shoe enough to get 2!

I've had Vionic sandals before, they were very comfortable, but the heel was open so I did not have that problem. Another problem with both pairs of Vionic shoes I've had is that the shoe interior is made of some kind of porous material, which is perfect for bacteria to grow, meaning very soon the shoes start stinking really bad and there is nothing that could be done to treat it...	2015-08-06

Calves are SUPER small. If you're a &#34;normal girl&#34; and not Barbie, these probably won't fit on your calves, sad to say. I'm not a big girl, but I'm a runner so I actually have calves, and I couldn't even get these boots on.

I'm not much of a purse girl (I'm really simple when it comes to purses), but I am a stickler for organization and practicality and this purse has both and is fashionably chic to boot! The purse is a really nice size (not too big and not too small), so I am able to fit all of my essentials in it (i.e., makeup case, wallet, checkbook, 8&#34; tablet, cell phone, keys, glasses, etc.) with room to spare and everything is not a big jumbled mess inside thanks to all of the handy pockets. There is a front zipper pocket that actually &#34;locks&#34; shut with the decorative lock shown on front, which I thought was a nice detail in design. There is also a nice size snap button pocket on the back, which allows easy access to frequently used items such as keys or ID. Inside the purse are three slip pockets (two in the front that are cell phone size and one in the back that is a little bigger than postcard size) and one zipper pocket. All of these pockets allow me to keep my other frequently used and smaller items tucked away neatly yet easy to find. The interior is lined with a nice polyester material with the Olivia & Joy logo on it and the outside is a good quality soft faux leather. I can't speak on the durability of it just yet since the purse is new, but I can say that it doesn't appear to be cheaply made. I would definitely buy this purse again at the sale price I bought it for as it is well worth it.	2015-08-06

The leather is beautiful and the crossbody strap (which is included) is long enough to be a crossbody.  It is a large hobo and will easily hold any ipad, along with all phones.

I'm between a 10 1/2 and 11, and usually wear a 10 1/2 in a slip on.  Ordered these in a 10 1/2 and they fit great.  Soft leather took virtually zero break-in time.  Fairly flat heel, but  not an issue for me.  They have a flat insole, so those needing support in your arches probably should look elsewhere.

I actually bought two pairs because I wanted to put my artwork on them for my sister and myself. They're a cheaper alternative to vans slip-ons while still being durable and comfortable. They worked just as well for artwork too. What I find with keds is that they're always just a tad narrow, but after some wear and breaking them in, they widen up just enough. I bought them during christmas and it's august now, so they've held up pretty well considering how poorly I treat my shoes.	2015-08-06

I started running at the beginning of the year in my old beat up sneakers.  Pretty soon my knees were killing me. My husband suggested getting some new running sneakers, and of course he was right!  My knees felt better almost instantly when I started running in these sneakers.  They are comfortable right out of the box and the fit was great in my regular size (8.5).  I was also very happy with the price!  Since I wasn’t sure how long I would stick with running I didn’t want to shell out a ton of money for shoes.  These sneakers ended up being just right!<br /><br />I like the colors - they aren’t too flashy, so I can wear them just about anywhere (I even wore them to work a few times).  I do feel like they make my feet look kind of big, but that’s not really an issue when I’m out running.  One thing I do think is a little strange is that if I wear bright colored socks I can see them through the mesh in the shoe. The thin mesh does keep them cool and comfortable though, so it’s a trade off.  The shoes have held up fine so far in the months that I’ve had them - I’m more of a casual jogger, so I’m certainly not anywhere close to running them into the ground.  I expect they will last me a good while yet.  When I need to replace them I won’t hesitate to buy another pair of Saucony Cohesions!	2015-08-06

I ordered these Clark's flip flops since I had bought another pair before and found them to be very comfortable and I'm able to wear them all day without pain. I have flat feet and other flip flops have always had hard rubber soles and after a while, I had to remove them because they really hurt my feet. These are so soft and comfortable, but also support my feet. I normally wear between a size 8 1/2 to 9, so I ordered the 9. They are slightly bigger than I'm used to but was afraid the 8 1/2 would be too short. I would definitely recommend them to others.	2015-08-06

These are some very good glasses, maybe the best of this style you're going to find. Yes, they are somewhat small, but that's the style of these glasses. You won't find any of these made by a normal manufacturer that are any bigger. And besides, I have a somewhat large head and these actually fit perfectly. The people saying these are too small are most likely just not used to this style. The glasses also come with a rigid protective case, soft holding bag (which doubles as a cleaning instrument), soft cleaning cloth, and micro-screwdriver keychain. The construction seems to be very solid compared to most glasses of this style. High quality, low price, very fast shipping, would definitely recommend.	2015-08-06

My son impatiently waited to get these in the mail (he's 3 1/2) and there a half size too big! I ordered a 11 and I would recommend ordering the size your child wears in most shoes instead! Now we have a brand new pair of toms that he can't wear until his foot grows some! So now I'm going to have to order him another pair.. he's normally a size 10/11<br />Other than that they're really nice shoes and good quality.	2015-08-06

The design is spot on.... the center slot is mainly intended for your laptop, and my son's 15-inch macbook and my 14-inch HP fit in any of the 3 slots.  The sizing for a cross-body bag is perfect..... and the inside pocket placements are genius!  I especially like the outside pocket slot for my iPhone 6 plus, yes! it fits perfectly.<br /><br />The top quality leather is thick smooth and durable which I knew would be top notch with a brand like Fossil, not disappointing in anyway..... great design, excellent stitching, zippers, brushed metal links and clasps.  Such a handsome bag, which I want to preserve, so I will definitely be treating it with a leather sealer to keep the rain from spotting,discoloring it.... being in Oregon, it's only a matter of time before it'll be unavoidably rain-exposed and I know this workbag is going to last a good long time.	2015-08-06

These shoes are very stylish and comfortable.  I typically wear a 6 or 6.5 in a sandal and ordered a 37, which was a half size too large.  I sent them back & am waiting on a 36 to arrive.  I love gladiator shooties, but they all seem to have a high heel that kill my feet after an hour.  The heel height on this shoe was perfect.  Very comfortable.  The leather upper was very flexible and comfortable, and the adjustable Velcro strap around the ankle helps tailor the shoe to your foot.  I agree with other reviewers who've written that the ankle strap is very roomy.  I have thick ankles (ugh!) and I had to overlap the straps quite a bit to get a proper fit.  If you have narrower ankles (lucky!) this might be tricky for you.  I ordered the grey, but the color looked more like taupe, which I preferred since it matched the color of my foot better.  The shoes had a great edgy look...not dowdy at all, even with all the comfort details built in.  They look awesome with my ankle pants and skinny pants and jeans.  Give them a try!	2015-08-06

They are light, weighing in at 10 oz. (size 11). Heel to toe offset is 4mm, and there is good arch support from the removable footbed.  Ample padding lines the collar and tongue.  I would rate the flexibility as slightly below average, but it presented no problem in comfort level. If you are a runner, which, at this age I am not, you will be happy with the cushioning and stability of the Mirage 4. The sole appears to be fabricated of durable materials. Lacing is standard with &#34;throwback&#34; flat laces. Al-in-all, definitely worth the price.	2015-08-06

The fit on length was true to size for me, as I wear a half size and it is not always available. For the price, these are quality. They do not compare to, say boots of $100 or something, but at this price its fine. Also, the boot on my feet, from the bottom to the height at the top, was very high. It left excess space above my foot at the ankle side, even after really tight lacing. I solved that issue by putting in a thick, gel based insole which made up the room and then it fit fine. i have very thin, very flat feet. I have a collapsible arch,which means it totally flattens out upon standing and is flat footed but still flexible. if you have a high arch, it might not have as much excess space for you. This is on flatter feet this happens most. on me, the toe box was a bit wide also, which was also fixed with the insole addition. The rubber sole area feels very deep, as if the foot rests within it a bit. This is ok by me, but some dislike that and like them flat  across. This boot has no arch support anyhow, so if high arched, you may want an insert either way. If I had ordered a half size or size down to make this less wide, it wouldve become too short however. someone with wider or taller feet will fit this ok. the color is as expected. The soles are sythetic and rubbery. I am sure this boot will not hold up through harsh winter in which I live, nor last years, but then, its cheap. I usually spend hundreds on boots for winter. i got these for Halloween, and to then wear out after, until I can afford some silver Docs. These are really decent boots for under &20.	2015-08-06

The toe area you will struggle with if you are wider than average. Just go with the nike romaleos if you are wide. I usually struggle to fit in narrow shoes although when i tried them on it just puffed up the sides to fit me.<br />Feel nice and firm, like a glove.. Just how it's suppose to be!<br />Sizing runs true to size, if you wear a normal 9.5 , get a 9.5 for these.<br />A lot of reviews are saying go up half a size, or go down half a size. So weird i just got the same normal size as 9.5<br />When i received the box from fedex i felt very happy, very very happy.<br />some things that concerned me was the shoe box was smashed up on the sides<br />and the shoe was very dusty lol + has a weird small black stain on the right shoe toe area<br />Not really concerned about anything!	2015-08-06

It's fits pretty well although I ordered a size up because I didn't want my heel or toes to be hanging over the front or back of the shoe. So it's definitely not true to size.<br /><br />What I dislike is the strap and buckle. If you look at the picture I posted, the original advertised pic is the lower right; the other three are of me wearing the shoe. As you can clearly see, the strap is not flush with the shoe; it sticks out away from the shoe. That cheapens the look of the shoe (to me). I was going to do something just to tack it down. But when I buy a shoe, I shouldn't have to make adjustments to it.	2015-08-06

They are fakes, 99% of all R4's on the Internet now are fakes, but the craftsmanship is so good on them it doesn't even matter nowadays.  The fine stitching, logo, everything is on point.  The only big difference is that the bootleg R4's being sold anywhere online will never have leather, as these don't, like the ones on Ebay don't; whereas back when Nike first sold these shoes I never ran into a pair where the main sidepanel isn't leather.  The R4's are essentially a discontinued line so these bootlegs are the only way to get them now.  If you go check any of the Chinese trading sites (like d****e.com - redacted) and search for R4's you will see merchants selling bootlegs for $60 in the exact same batch of colors and exact sizes (7-12) that the people on Ebay and Amazon are selling their R4's in.  Coincidence?  I will say this - it's obvious someone in China got their hands on the molds for these shoes and setup a factory with professional shoe equipment to pump these out without authorization from Nike.  They might not be up to Nike's quality control standards, but these knockoffs are so good I bet the quality on these things would beat a lot of other real shoe companys' shoes.<br /><br />As I said, the R4's are discontinued.  Nike will re-release a couple colors now and then and places like Footlocker will carry them, but there's no rhyme or reason to it.  If the knockoffs are as durable as the real thing, you have to ask yourself if it really matters that is a knockoff.	2015-08-06

I own a lot of TOMS (24+ pairs and counting, including glitter Toms in just about every color it was made), but these are my go-to shoes for every day wear. They match with everything, and they instantly class up your outfit. Don't be afraid that they are so sparkly. They are glittery, but not tacky. Seriously, even Jessica Alba has a pair! (just google &#34;Glitter Toms Jessica Alba&#34;) You can't go wrong with that.  One thing I would suggest is to not size down a complete size when buying glitter TOMS. Unlike classic fabric TOMS, the glitter material does not stretch as much over time, so sizing down by half a size will do. Another thing to note is that TOMS shoes are notoriously not consistent in sizing. That means that you can buy 2 pairs of the exact same shoes, and one pair can be CONSIDERABLY larger than the other, even though in theory, they should both be the exact same size. In fact, I have even received TOMS where one shoe is noticeably larger than the other inside the same shoe box. This means that if you KNOW you are a size 5 in Toms, and the shoes you received are too big or too small, you may want to try another size 5 again because the pair you received may have just been &#34;off.&#34; Luckily, Amazon has an awesome return policy, so exchanging is never a problem.  One down side to these shoes is that the glitter does eventually fall off, but it is not as noticeable on the silver color glitter as it is on other darker color glitter TOMS. This is a small trade-off for me considering how versatile these shoes are. In fact, I love them so much, I just bought a back-up pair for when my pair meets its final demise.	2015-08-06

I got them for nursing school/CNA type work. They are flat bottomed but that's exactly why I got them. One of the reviews I read said that they help prevent ankle rolling (they are a lifting shoe). This is true, and they have very good traction – even on water. They are flat bottomed so I use an insole because I'm on my feet all day. I have hip dysplasia and because of that I have chronic neck, shoulder, back, and leg pain. Even on the first day I wore the shoes for 10 hours and I did not feel any pain that normally comes with breaking shoes in. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they are a bit small. I usually wear a 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe and because of other reviews I ordered a size 7 and it fits perfectly with the insole.	2015-08-06

First it aS deceiving when on July 15  when I purchased the product, it said it was regular $547 slashed down too 29.99. I figured I was getting a amazing deal. After purchasing  I googled to find out the actual or I price is 48.00! I was upset for the deception, but it was a cute purse. Now I'm anger because not even a month later, nor  has it been used for less than 20 days I received it, I have two holes in it. Even a 48.00 purse will not do that.  One takes up one of the side pouches in the lining, the other in the zipper pocket. So a lot of mistrust has now developed with Amazon.	2015-08-06

With a decent arch and very comfortable material, I find I don't have to do much breaking in on these, and can walk or stand for long periods without getting blisters or being the least bit uncomfortable. I can wear these with the most casual outfits, but find that the look nice enough to get away with a slightly nice outfit too (borderline appropriate for work depending on the office - wouldn't wear to finer restaurants).<br /><br />I replace mine every year or two, depending on how much I have worn them down. My foot is an average width woman's 7.5, so I buy the 8 (since Reef doesn't make 1/2 sizes). I find that with the 8, I have a little extra sandal at the front and back (maybe an 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch), which is perfect (big pet peeve when people have toes or heels hanging off their shoes). The sandal width works well for an average foot, but I would not recommend these for someone with a wider foot, because they may find the sides of there foot over the edges of the sandal.	2015-08-06

These glasses are very sturdy. They seem better constructed than most sunglasses. At almost $100.00, they should.  When I received them, I noticed that the lenses are larger than I realized. My old Nike wrap-arounds are smaller.  I should have paid more attention to the size before I bought.  That said, they fit well. I find them to be comfortable.  I live in Arizona, where it is sunny almost all the time. I find that there is no distortion of any kind from the lenses.  Spending $100 on sunglasses is a bit much. I have a notion you could equal this in quality for half of that. But, if you are willing to go to three digits for sunglasses, these are quite nice.	2015-08-06

The first pair is no longer available so I needed to look for a comparable model online. The advantage here is that instead of buying a pair of shoos a half-size too large, as I must in a shoe store – where they don't stock half-sizes, I could get the precise size I needed through Amazon. In this case, after the shoes arrived I found that the heel is higher than usual which actually makes the shoes more comfortable and tends to propel me forward as I walk. It's also more restful standing still.<br /><br />The main reason I bought another pair of Saucony shoes is that the sole of the old pair lasted longer than any other athletic shoe I've every owned. The reason I needed another pair was because the inside lining of the shoe was fraying. This happens with every pair of shoes, but usually by the time the lining is wearing out, the soul of the shoes are also about finished. However, my old pair of Saucony shoes still have some life in them because the sole is still sound, with plenty of tread. They are obviously built to wear well rather then to with programed obsolescence.	2015-08-06

Fit exactly to size and are snug as they should be so they stay on your feet. Bought them for use in OCR races and I found them great for hiking also. Padding on the heel is perfect and they dry quickly. The no-tie lacing system is very effective and does not slip loose; especially with The drawcinch tucked into the toungue pocket. The best part is the tread. The two direction lugs grab everything when going up hill or down hill. I simply do not slip. This is something I have never gotten from other trail, running, or hiking footwear. As others stated, for the lugs to bite the terrain, they are softer than standard show soles. So wearing them to walk or run on streets or concrete often will prematurely wear them out. Use them as intended and they are excellent!	2015-08-06

The length was perfect, and width was fine for me (therefore, they run somewhat narrow) but the way the shoe is made just ended up being uncomfortably tight right over the big toe.  I think they would respond to stretching - the leather is soft and supple and quite nice - but between the pale matte color (not taupe, really, more pinkish flesh-tone) and heavy leather grain appearance, they actually looked too much like... weird skin.  The leather grain just emphasized the skin-ness of them.  Caution with this color if you're pale; these would be more flattering for those with darker skin tone, for more contrast between foot and shoe.  They did seem well-made.	2015-08-06

However, these are very sturdy and very comfortable.  I have to remove the insole and replace it with my orthonics, and these fit perfectly once I've done that.  I typically wear and 8.5 or 9 W, and the 9 C/D just right. I'm wearing a mid-weight hiking sock with these.  If you want to wear a thicker sock, you may need to go a half size larger.  I wouldn't be on really rocky trails with these as they aren't over the ankle, but the sole seems to be thick enough to keep you from feeling every stone on a normal, groomed trail.  Update:  Recently wore these while hiking in Arizona.  It wasn't a &#34;groomed&#34; trail and I had no issues with stones coming through the sole.  I did have to be careful because these are not over the ankle, but they were definitely comfortable for 3-5 miles.	2015-08-06

Ryka's are my favorite water aerobic shoe!  I wish the laces on this pair a loop and not loose on the ends though, but I just double knot them and that works.  The ofter excellent support and the fit is great! It's important for water aerobics to have a good shoe.  Even though you are in water, your feet still take a pounding, and the rough pool bottoms can tear up your feet too.  Don't waste your time and money on cheap WalMart water shoes.  If you are going to do water aerobics, as with any sport, get the right shoe!	2015-08-06

First,  it took 16 days for me to get these shoes from UpFootGear and they never contacted me after I inquired where  my shoes were. I suggest buying them from someone else. While they are nice looking flips, the footbed is much firmer than my old chaco flips and the arch support isn't in quite the right spot.  I can only wear these for a couple hours--they just aren't very comfortable.  I like the leather strap but it rubs between my toes the wrong way, adding to the discomfort.  I ordered new straps 2 sizes smaller like people had suggested but I can't even get my foot into the sandal with them on.  Not too hard to change, but that was a waste of money.  I should probably return these but I have a feeling it's more hassle than it's worth.  I recommend the regular flips as they are softer, more supportive and all around more comfortable.	2015-08-06

They are more like a 12 1/2. They're a little narrow as well. I took the laces out and have been wearing them at work under my desk to break them in. So far, after 1 week, they only broke in a little. I'm going to hold onto them because I have put some weight on over the last couple yrs. If I loose weight, maybe they'll fit a little better.<br />I measured the sole from heal to toe and it's exactly 13 inches but the actual toe of the shoe itself (where your feet are) is a little under 13 inches. So, my toes are wedged right up to the front and my heal is pressed against the back of the shoe. I checked all my other shoes and the sole is a little over 13 and the shoe area that holds your foot is right at 13. So it shows these ARE a little shorter than all my other size 13's. But..I'll give them a try. Lets see if they loosen up.<br />Update: Although they never really loosened up except when I used a shoe stretcher and a ton of leather softener, they are a very solid shoe and I've gotten some compliments on them. They just run about a 1/2 size small.	2015-08-06

I love the orthopedic qualities, and found these had a stress-relieving, whole-body effect.  This even lasted, once I took off the shoes.<br /><br />Yet, there is nothing noticeable in wearing them, to make this happen . They just feel so natural. These shoes are light on your feet, and so soft. Once you look inside the shoe, though, you will see it's in there.<br /><br />I ordered these in ice blue, which is &#34;outside the box&#34; for a shoe color I would normally wear. Yet, I found I love the color, too. It goes perfectly with jeans, as well as with shorts or similar summer wear. The style is casual enough, yet classy enough, too. It is well balanced for any number of occasions you might like to wear them for, or for everyday use.<br /><br />The venting on the shoe works really well. In the mid-day summer heat, though I did find my feet getting a bit warm, they did not sweat. So, this was definitely a welcome effect.<br /><br />On a final note, I normally wear a size nine shoe, and the size in this shoe fits me perfectly.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these shoes!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.	2015-08-06

The Hayate shoes of the same marked size were significantly smaller than the Inspire: much, much narrower at the ball of the foot, and the fabric across the top was prohibitively tight for me. Mind you, I don't have particularly wide feet, but I couldn't run more than a few steps in these because it was so tight across the top when pushing off. Also, although the information I found said this was a &#34;stability&#34; shoe, it still had a lot of torsional flex and the footprint is very narrow. I will buy the Inspire again, but returned the Hayate: it may be a great trail racing shoe for someone, but not for me.	2015-08-06

Transitioning out of a Brooks adrenaline so they feel very different. So far they are helping me get rid of my heel strike which was the main purpose of the purchase.<br /><br />I feel a hot burning sensation that I never felt on the brooks with all its support, just need more time to get use to them.<br /><br />Good luck with your search.	2015-08-06

I am impressed with the quality and fit of this boot especially since I have returned 3 other brands and styles of cycle boots due fit/comfort.  To me....these are winners and provide great protection.  My question about them is if after they get broken in could I leave them laced and simply use the zipper. Right now they are to tight/ stiff to put on that way....but perhaps they were not designed that way.  I am taking them to a shoe repair store and having a finger loop sewed in the rear to assist in putting them on. I think that they needed this anyway.	2015-08-06

Also the purse isn't 3 separate compartments- the middle zipper compartment is just attached at the top, which mean stuff can slide under and switch sides.

At first he was reluctant to wear them and thought he wouldn't wear them much at all, why did I buy them, they're not his type of shoe, etc.  But after wearing them everyday on vacation, he started to like them.  He didn't like how the sand balled up under his foot when he wore them on the beach but I reminded him that they are probably not a good choice of shoe for wearing in loose sand.  Other than that he was impressed with how they dried quickly and still looked great after getting sand and salt water on them for a couple of days and he could then wear them bike riding, walking around, etc and they still looked great and felt comfortable.  He didn't tell me of anything that was uncomfortable or rubbed him about the shoe either.  The biggest plus is that his feet felt and looked great after wearing them all week because they allow for more air circulation.  He has very sweaty feet that are usually in sneakers all day so these were very beneficial. :)	2015-08-06

They actually look cute on, but they are definitely quirky. The glasses are comfortable and they stay put, which is a must.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the lenses are foggy. You can tell they are made from a cheaper plastic. I don't mind, though. I received a complimentary pair of glasses in exchange for an honest review, but even at the current list price (fourteen bucks), I still feel like this is a good product for the price. You're not going to get Kate Spade quality for under twenty dollars, you know?<br /><br />Overall, these glasses are cute. The style is a bit too over-the-top for everyday wear, in my opinion, but I will wear them on days I'm looking for something a bit more fun.	2015-08-06

I have wide feet and bunions that make finding ballroom shoes tough, and heard that these run wide.<br /><br />I have difficult feet. They are wide, like hobbits with bunions. I got these with the intention of putting them on a shoe stretcher.  I could actually squeeze my feet into these shoes without stretching them, which means they probably do run wide. I ordered my street shoe size, 6.5.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have to return these shoes. I don't think there's anything wrong with them, but the sole is very stiff and impossible to point my toes in. These could be great for social dancing and beginners, but offer no forefoot flexibility. Granted, I'm not sure these were intended for anything besides social dance, so it's not necessarily a defect of the shoe.<br /><br />It does look like a well made shoe, and has an awesome locking mechanism. I'm curious how that wears over time.	2015-08-06

I have a Morton's Neuroma and have a hard time with shoes that go straight across foot, so these with the diagonal strap are great.  The back little strap helps keep them on, but can be removed and are equally comfortable and stay on well.  I will buy them in another color too.  Love the Aqua blue of these shoes.	2015-08-06

I purchased them last year and wore them so much I decided to treat myself to another pair this year. They have just enough heel to keep them from being completely flat, yet have a soft, cushiony step that allows you to wear them all day without pain or discomfort. I am on my feet all day and am able to wear these comfortably. I have also received many compliments on them. Definitely worth the price. If you are a half-size, order up.	2015-08-06

Purchased this at a discount, during a promotion, for my honest and unbiased opinion. Wonderful quality Classic Polarized Sunglasses. The glasses are made from hard black plastic and the arms are held on with metal screws. The glasses came in a box and inside the box they were inside a nice cloth bag. The bag is great for keeping them in. My daughter is sunglasses obsessed and has at least 50 pairs. She spends a lot of her money on the glasses. When I was offered these I was excited to try them. I am glad I did. She just loves them, wearing them daily, which means she loves them because all her other glasses are sitting on her dresser. The detailing on the side arms is very nice raised butterfly pattern. It is actually made from silver metal and screwed into the earpiece. These Polarized fashion sunglasses by Mambo Shades are great quality and will last a long time. I highly recommend them.	2015-08-06

These shoes are wonderful! The shoes are true to size(I'm a size 6 and ordered a size 6) but remember that you have to break them in seeing that they're leather and that they'll be a bit stiff and tight when you get them. With time they'll become softer and to help with that, it's suggested to get mink oil or the wonder balsam(whichever you prefer)  They're the real Dr. martens for those who were wondering. Came in the original box with extra laces. There is just a small stitching mistake on the side of both shoes but it's not a big deal or in any case noticeable unless you're really picky about detail. Personally, I don't mind. They look great on and pretty much goes with everything. A great buy!	2015-08-06

The shoebox was banged up but the shoes were neatly placed in the box (in a tight space).<br /><br />The color of the shoes were as expected.  The gold studs were beautiful!  They fit as the reviews stated. When I examined the shoes, I noticed the bottoms looked like they were made wrong- a lot of bumps and the inside of the shoes looked like they they would peel easily.<br />I contacted the seller telling them why I wanted a refund and they responded graciously and issued me a refund.

I read that these ran a little small.  I wear a 7 1/2 - 8 size, so I ordered an 8 to err on the side of caution and they fit well.  My feet are pretty normal width and they fit fine that way as well.  But could see if you have wider feet that they wouldn't fit as well.<br />More comfortable than expected, but the small straps still do dig slightly on the toes.  I have only worn them around the house to try on, but they are tolerable as far as comfort.  I've never really met a &#34;comfortable&#34; heel.  lol.  I like the ankle strap as well as I don't worry about slipping out of them.	2015-08-06

I even had to pay full price for the first exchange, I was that committed to them..<br />I´m usually size 8 for these kinda of &#34;skinny&#34; shoes -think of Converse- and I read in most of the reviews that these ran small..so I figured I´d go with a whole size up (9), but they still felt really tight so I went half size again (9.5), didn't feel much difference. I even wear them a little longer this time, but still they were just really snuggly.<br />I was willing to make a second exchange, but this time I didn't have that option and to be honest I was pretty much done with the whole buy-shoes-online experience so at this point I´m just waiting on my refund. It´s a shame, they really look good :|	2015-08-06

They are very comfortable. I normally wear a size 8 B or C and the medium were a good fit with a little wiggle room to spare. My only complaint is that the edges beyond the stitching extend out too much (especially along the front)  and I find myself walking funny to avoid catching them on the floor--it feels like wearing a shoe that is too large. By the time I realized this would be a significant issue, I had worn them too much to return them.  I am using them but this is a purchase I would not make again.	2015-08-06

I was a little bit skeptical about purchasing this purse after reading some of the reviews. I am also extremely picky when it comes to purses. After thinking about it I decided to purchase this purse in purple. I found myself checking the USPS tracking almost daily because I was so excited. It did take about 3 weeks before I received this purse, but I also received it about a week earlier than the estimated arrival date. I did notice a small oder from the purse, probably from the processing and packaging but nothing that lasted for more than an hour or so. The inside of the purse has a nice circular pattern with a zipper pocket and two other smaller pockets. There is also a 3/4 zipper closure as well as a button, which I like for added security and peace of mind. Great size, exactly what I was looking for. I thought I would remove the longer strap but I like have the longer strap and the smaller handles. Color was exactly like it is in the pictures. I cannot comment on the longevity of this purse because I have not had it that long but so far I love it and it cannot wait to purchase this purse in both white and grey.	2015-08-06

I did purchase this exact one from a local chain store. My daughter used it for a grand total of SIX days of her freshman year of high school before one of the main straps broke. It ripped at the seam, and when I took it apart to look, it seems the cheap faux leather fabric wasnt song enough to withstand being seen through...it ripped right along the sewing holes. While it can be repaired, I imagine it's not going to hold up long if it only made it six days the first go around.  This backpack is way too pricey to be so cheaply made.	2015-08-06

I ordered the solar red because that's the color my son liked the most. I could tell from the picture that it looked more orange than red, so I was expecting more of an orange. The color is so bright, and it has a pink hue to it. As soon as I pulled them out of the box, my son said they were hot pink. My neighbor said the same thing. After looking at them for a while, I can see that they are indeed orange, but it's a very girly orange and at first glance, most people think they are pink. My son refuses to wear them! Other than the color issue, the shoes are well made. My son said they are very comfortable, and he would love them in another color. I don't have time to send them back for a replacement before school, so I will just be ordering them in another color.	2015-08-06

I purchased a pair of these shoes a good decade ago and have worn them to death. I loved that they were kind of just a more narrow version of the traditional clogs, which I also own and like but come on. They're so ugly.<br /><br />Unfortunately I decided to wear them during our DIY home renovation (which was fabulously comfortable, by the way) and now they are covered in paint and plaster and what have you. Of course, in the back of my head, I thought &#34;Hey this are totally replaceable. Just ruin them.&#34; Went and ordered a new pair on Amazon to discover they TOTALLY changed the design! UGH. The new ones now have a fixed back strap and are waaaaaaayyyy tighter that the original. Ordered the exact same size and they are too narrow, short and super tight. I hate them.<br /><br />So upset. Returning.<br /><br />I should mentioned I do loves me some crocs, though. These things are indestructible.

As i found myself sitting on the floor trying to paint black over the scrapes on the buttons-THAT DIDNT EVEN CLOSE ALL THE WAY ON SOME- i felt this sudden rush of embarrassment even though i was all alone-oh and i didnt even mention how peeled the edges were. The shoes dont match the picture. Long story short: i got catfished. I dont want my money back, i want you to stop making low quality stuff  like this - we pay good money.

I was also worried about these being slide on slippers because I have stairs in my house and I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't lose a slipper while going up and down. I have done that before so normally I wear closed back slippers.<br />I read in some previous reviews that these have a hook and loop closure to help with a secure fit, and that is accurate. I put them on the first time and closed them as tight as was comfortable and haven't had any incidents.<br />I really look forward to coming home at the end of the day and putting these on.

This was my first pair of Tom's, so I wasn't entirely sure what size to order, so I relied on some reviews.. I typically wear a 9-9.5, so I ordered a 9.5 because some reviews had said that it was necessary to go on the larger side with this particular shoe. They were WAY too big, unwearable, as my feet did not even stay in them when I walked. Ok, no problem, I'll return them and get a 9. Well I read some more reviews afterwards claiming that shoes from this seller are fake. I went to go take a closer look at mine and realized they are a 9.5W... Not only did I not order a wide, according to the Tom's website the company doesn't even sell shoes in wide, only medium. So glad I checked, as I was about to go ahead and just order the 9's. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything from this seller and will definitely go directly through Tom's. Lesson learned.	2015-08-06

The heel is a good, solid heel and looks good with the style of the shoe.<br /><br />These are a little bit narrower than I expected them to be- if you have borderline wide feet, these may not work for you. I wear a pretty consistent regular width size 5, and these start out just a tad snug.<br /><br />Be prepared to wear these for a couple hours to break them in before wearing them for a full day. You may also need to use a shoe horn when you put them on the first couple of times because of how they are packaged and stored.	2015-08-06

OK for short time casual wear	I bought these (black) because I wanted a pair of retros, and these definitely fit the bill. However that's where the &#34;fit&#34; ended. I usually buy my sneakers size 9 M/D, and so I did the same when ordering these. The length wasn't bad, material a little thin and not great arch support - but the width is what makes these uncomfortable.<br /><br />Now, I've only worn these 3 times so far, but I doubt these are the kind of shoes that &#34;open up&#34; with time, but we'll see.<br /><br />The styling is good, they are lightweight. Came with two sets of laces which was a nice surprise (white and grey). They are good for a couple hours of casual wear, I don't think they would feel too good for extended walking, etc.	2015-08-06

They're comfortable to me, I read others reviews on these before I bought them and saw some complain that the back of the shoe rubs on the ankle - I didn't experience that at all. The materials seem like high quality and no problems at all.<br /><br />Cons: They get warm in hot weather since they are leather and don't have any ventilation built in. No arch support, they are flat as a board on the bottom with very little cushion. I actually bought some inserts but that made the fit too tight so I go without.	2015-08-06

The lamb shaped heel is okay, but not as cute as the other animals like the panda or bunny. Also I did not notice the strange edge around the front of the shoe. It makes the shoes look bulky and wide. I usually take a 37 in Irregular Choice but for some reason the ones with lower heels and no front platform seem to fit smaller. I got these in a 38 adn they fit like a glove. So I would say if you have wider feet or if you like a little wiggle room for your toes size up on these.	2015-08-06

I decided my old ratty (but trusty!) ones were due for an upgrade so I bought these.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these weren't quite what I expected from Asics. They were a little heavier, narrower and the material was a little stiffer. Perhaps it's all because they're meant for trail running. However, I found that while running on dirt, my lighter, slightly wider and more breathable old Asics performed the same. These weren't any less slick neither did they provide much more support related to cushioning and/or shock absorption. These perhaps keep the water from seeping into my shoes a little bit longer; however, not long enough to really matter to me.<br /><br />They are still a great pair of shoes. They're lighter than most. They're durable and have great breathability. For some who moderately overpronates, these are great. Between the underfoot cushioning that provide extra support and the way it's built around your foot, I find that I feel safe that I won't roll my ankle in these.<br /><br />As far as shoes go, these are still a great pair. As far as Asics shoes go, these are not my favorite.	2015-08-06

I just got these the other day, so I will update this review if anything unexpected happens during the first few months of use, but I have multiple Keen sandals, all of which are the best shoes I've ever owned, and I expect these will follow suit!<br /><br />These shoes have a great look, and I love the flashy spark of bright blue on the tongue and laces!! They fit like a dream. Although I can completely see how the mouth at the ankle might be a bit loose for some people, I have thick ankles and calves, and wide feet, and the 6.5M fit me very comfortably! And they are so light (especially for hiking shoes) that after a few minutes I forgot I was wearing them! I also have high arches, and these shoes have excellent support, and a thick sole with great grip and water resistance. I cannot wait to get out on the trail!! These are a fantastic deal, especially on sale for just under $50! My keen sandals have lasted me through daily wear and tear (I work outside most of the time), and are still going strong after 6+ years, and I hope for the same quality with these excellent hiking shoes. Highly recommended!	2015-08-06

I had been wearing the Cherokee Pamela, but the top part of shoe was leaving an indentation on my foot because it was too tight, otherwise I loved that shoe.  I bought this shoe without having tried it on anywhere else, so it was a bit of a risk.  I wear a size 7.5 & bought an 8, but it was a little smaller than I expected.  It's super comfy, though, & after a couple weeks, it's stretched out some & I can wear my insoles.  My only &#34;con&#34; is that the actual support of the shoe (top & sides) is so soft that my feet felt more fatigued compared to the Pamela at the end of the day.  The heel, too, is a little lower than the Pamela's & I liked the height of the Pamela better.  But there's hardly any weight to the shoe, & it's very soft & comfy.  For my 13-hr workday, however, I might consider a shoe next time with a little stiffer support.	2015-08-06
US	11130295	R2UCQLLFMQL05Z	B008XEDQJM	504986035	Five Ten Women's Exum Guide Hiking Shoe	Shoes	5	0	0	N	Y	Great for Caving--tested in Vietnam Jungle!	I bought these for a four-night trek through the Vietnam jungle through the largest cave in the world, Son Doong. The caving experts recommended the Five Ten Canyoneer shoes but at nearly $200 I couldn't swing that. These have the same grippy sole that the Canyoneers have but they are much more affordable. I believe these were perfect for my needs. They were super grippy and we did a lot of rock climbing, both on wet and dry surfaces, and these soles made me like a gecko, especially compared to others in our group who had Keens and Merrells and the like. I also needed shoes that were not waterproof, as we would be crossing a lot of rivers and waterproof boots hold water. These did end up staying soggier than I would have liked, so that's my only beef with them. They were able to dry out in one day in an air conditioned hotel room upon our return, but our camps were too humid for them to dry completely during the trip. They were super comfortable for the duration of the journey. The terrain was extremely rough underfoot for most of the trip and these did a good job of keeping my feet stable. They do run small: I'm normally between an 8.5 and a 9 and I bought these in a 9.5 (the size I usually buy for running shoes) and they were perfect. So I would say get at least a half size up...if you're in between sizes, go a full size up from your smaller size. In the photo you can see they look a bit chunky but they served me well despite that. The photo is after two days of hiking through the jungle, crossing a river more than 30 times, and scrambling over lots of rocks. I definitely plan to use these again for camping and hiking stateside, as they are super comfortable. I would not have changed anything about my shoe selection for this cave trip, but if I were to do a longer amphibious trip where grippiness was less of a concern, I would go with something that dries more quickly. This was a solid purchase and I would definitely recommend this as a comfortable shoe that gripslike a gecko!	2015-08-06

My husband swears by Sneaker Balls for deodorizing his shoes and slippers.  He has used them for many years and now needs new ones.  This is a pretty good deal.  When I opened the box, these balls, still in the package, gave off a lot of good fragrance.  I imagine they will work for years.  If you have smelly shoes or slippers, these little balls are the answer.	2015-08-06

The finish on them looks good, but glue marks from the side shoe to the beginning of the sole does not look great. They are some what comfy. It takes no time for these memory foam inserts to go flat, in which I find no arch support.  Also there is no 360 lacing that is in the description. Sperry and Sebago and other boat shoes have 360 lacing where the side lace in the pic attaches to the top lace. Now this is all coming from an 12 year old Sperry wearing guy who bought these at $45 on Amazon and after a GC for under $20.  Inserts I can change out and for work shoes they will do.  Had I purchased these for the list at $89.00 I could have bought another pair of Sperry Mako 2 and there would be no comparison.	2015-08-06

They are warm though, so maybe not for summertime, and nubuck, so maybe not for really wet days, but they are well made, and the sizing was accurate. We'd definitely buy again, and Hush Puppies has a younger fan now, so there's that. :-)	2015-08-06

Not heavy at all.<br /><br />Received this product in exchange for a review	2015-08-06

When yo	Lovely shoes. I'm size 8M and shoes fitted as expected (I got the leopard print). I have a high arch and it's tough to find shoes (other than mary-janes) that don't fall off my feet - these are perfect.  When you get them, the sole is a bit slippery - but 30 min on a rough city asphalt walk fixes it.<br />The toe is a bit on a narrow side, but not crazily (my toes where not too squished together).	2015-08-06

The foot bed felt great and the gold and cork color was reasonably attractive. The problem was the poorly designed straps. All of the cross straps and the ankle strap were too long. The cross straps had so much velcro on them that even when they were adjusted as tightly as possible, there was still exposed velcro which rubbed against the top of my foot. The ankle strap was so long that it looped around and overlapped the top cross strap, making for a very bulky, unattractive look. If someone had a foot so large that it required straps this long, their foot would not fit on the foot bed. Finally, on one sandal the ankle strap was stitched to the inside supporting strap at the wrong angle, causing it to bulge outwards. Poor manufacturing. If Vionic could pair its superior footbed design with high quality uppers made from good leather, they would probably sell a lot more sandals. Combine the Vionic footbed with a Joseph Seibel upper, and you'd really have something.	2015-08-06

Although I was recently promoted to restaurant manager, I still have to waitress a few times a week. I need a wallet that can hold a couple hundred dollars worth of one dollar bills without breaking the zipper. This wallet does that and so much more.<br /><br />I used to use a makeup bag to carry a wallet that held my wallet with cash, a change purse with all my coins, and a money clip to hold all my rewards cards. I've been able to condense this all into one single wallet. It has ample space to carry cash, tons of card slots to hold my numerous rewards cards for various places, and coins. I still have room for my receipts (I'm one of those few people who still use a check register to manage my checking account) without having to rip them out of the zipper because there's enough space.<br /><br />I bought this wallet originally in taupe which was what I wanted at the time, but it's too boring for me (what did I expect!?). I sewed on a little patch to jazz it up a bit. That's not the wallets fault though, I should've known this when I ordered taupe haha. Should anything ever happen to this wallet, I'll just order another color. But I don't foresee anything happening to it anytime soon, it's built well and I just don't see it falling apart at all.<br /><br />Wallets on the bigger side are so expensive in store. Seriously I bought a comparable wallet at target that was maybe a smidge smaller than this one years ago and it was in the 30 to 40 dollar range. That one had stylish buckles on it that frayed and fell apart after a month or two. So sometimes, it's nice to get a plain wallet. I mean come on, it's in your purse all the time, it's gonna get banged around and beaten up. With this wallet, you're not gonna have to worry about jewels or studs or buckles falling off and making your wallet look like junk. I highly recommend this.<br /><br />I was not given this wallet for my review. I bought this with my own money and I'm giving you my honest opinion on it with no persuasion from any of the sellers.t opinion on it with no persuasion from any of the sellers.	2015-08-06

These are SUPER cute.  I love them.  They're spiky and make me oh so much taller and that's excellent for many purposes- weight distribution by additional height makes you look thinner, win-win.  These also come with additional spike replacements and they're sized to fit- perfectly.	2015-08-06

These Basketball sneakers are extremely light, and cool, I just received them and took them for a spin in the street court. The performance is great. I feel comfortable while jumping, running, etc. Feel great support of the ankle but unconstrained at the same time. Great arch support, and they seem to protect the balls and the sole of the feet also. Did I say these are almost weightless? Because they are. The combination of my three favorites color is striking in its contrast, grrrrrrreat design! I´ll update later on, but these are the bomb to play on or off the court.<br />FITTING: This is important, in my case, and I my feet are a little bit wide, I recommend going half a size up (9.5 to 10 -US-).

A half dozen years ago I went into a Nike outlet store and bought a pair of shoes that have turned out to be terrific. Very supportive, pretty comfortable, and they wear very well. Nike still makes a shoe with the same model name, but it's not as supportive of my apparently wide feet. I stumbled on some New Balance shoes, studied reviews and descriptions and after trying out a different model, I landed on these MW928s. As I write this review, I have been wearing these all day without any discomfort.<br /><br />Although I like the slightly sporty character of gray, my wife says they aren't dressy enough to wear with slacks. So I bought an identical pair, in black, and they are good too. I expect these will last quite a while. They offer excellent traction along with stability. On unusually hot days my feet get a bit too warm in them, but most of the time this is not a problem. The other attributes of this shoe make that discomfort worthwhile.	2015-08-06

Favorite multi-purpose shoe ever	I listened to the reviews and ordered a half size larger than my largest foot. I was swimming in them, especially the length for each foot. My feet are 8 & 8.5. I ordered a 9. I wear 8.5 in all other shoes. I returned the 9's and ordered 8.5. Unfortunately Amazon would not let me exchange them and receive my prior $30 off. So I ordered the new pair from elsewhere. I love the idea of this water, hiking, sandal foot wear. I own a pair of flip flops, men's for the added width. I love the roomy toe area, yet arch and elsewhere cradle my sole, with some extra space on the sides and in front of toes (should have bought an 8).

I wasn't able to find the model she has here in the US so I decided to give these ones a try.<br /><br />I have to say I have pretty mixed feelings about these sandals and Merrel brand in general. First of all, based on all the reviews I've read and also my first experience with a different model I ordered from DSW (and returned), I went with a smaller size than mine. I'm a true 6.5 when it comes to most shoes, except for winter boots. Those I prefer in 7-7.5 so I can chose what thickness socks to wear. But for most sandals and flip flops and pretty much anything &#34;open toe&#34;, anything in 6-6.5 works well. Typically. Well, not Merrell's apparently. The DSW pair I got in 7 was huge and left tons of space in front of my toes and didn't look as cute in reality so I returned it to the store. Found these ones and ordered them in size 6 to avoid the same situation I had with the other pair. Wrong again. The sole wasn't small. It was ok. No toes hanging over because my foot wouldn't even fit that far into the sandal lol<br /><br />The very first strap (non adjustable and closest to your ankle that goes over the &#34;instep&#34;) would not allow for my foot to go much further. Fine! I sent them back and exchanged for yet again, size 7. Size 7 of this style fits a bit better and the sole isn't too long like the other ones. Little room in front of my toes but nothing crazy. Straps are slightly wider but I'm still uncomfortable with the tightness of that instep strap :-( And the other strap you can adjust on these in the front doesn't really do anything. It's pretty much there for looks lol The front strap is surprisingly comfy for me but only because I have wide &#34;duck&#34; feet with all toes of the same length. so for anyone who has normal more pointy feet, it'll most likely be too wide :-(<br />I'm hoping that it'll stretch with time because it's leather and the sole is comfy. I can't say it gives amazing arch support. It seems to me that in order for that to happen, it would need to be more firm instead of soft but they do feel nice to walk in. I have yet to test them on a really long walk (5 miles +), but I'm keeping them simply because I need a pair of comfy walking sandals and I&#34;m tired of exchanging them. Not sure I will buy Merrell's sandals again though. The whole &#34;no half sizes&#34; thing is pretty disappointing. All of the adjustment features they offer do not make up for weird sole sizes for all of us half size people and sometimes, the straps that need to be adjustable the most are not. Besides, they aren't exactly $39.99. I guess I expected more for the price :-( Time will tell if at least the quality makes up for fitment difficulties :-)	2015-08-06

These boots were for my wife.  She needed some very comfortable, waterproof boots to work on our 80-acres in the wet Pacific Northwest.  When she goes into &#34;beast-mode&#34;, there is absolutely no stopping her.  (Seriously... her favorite &#34;toys&#34; are orange and have the name &#34;Stihl&#34; on them!)  So, she needed boots that would hold up to a lot of abuse, yet keep her feet warm, dry, and comfortable when she feels like &#34;playing&#34; for 16-hours a day in the woods. These boots are definitely as tough as her. There is no secret as to why they fit her so well right out of the box... she tried them on at a store first, duh!  (And I know what you're thinking... why is my wife wearing men's boots, right?  Because she has bigger balls than most men I know, and she feels like it!)	2015-08-06

The Velcro on this allows me to undo the top and slide my foot in. I have wide feet but they are still comfortable enough. Would probably fit better on someone who doesn't have wide feet but it's not that bad. At first, it did rub the sides that are towards the inside of my feet. But after finding the right adjustment of the top and breaking them in, it fits fine. I appreciate the the cushioning. Very comfortable and light.	2015-08-06

Lamo (as in &#34;Lamb&#34;) Women's Merino Scuffs vs. Ugg Coquette:<br /><br />1st, RE: Size-  These Lamo's run waaaay short.  I wear a 9 in Ugg, size 10 in Frye boots & shoes, & size 9 or 10 XXW in Reeboks / Converse- In comparison, the XXL (11-12) Lamo is even smaller-  (shorter length, same width- Hard to believe this, but true!)  Since I'm sort of between a 9-10 in regular shoes (Wide Width), these XXL's are just barely long enough for my foot.  (The cushy-ness will mat down over time, allowing my foot to slide deeper into the slipper).  However:  To be clear- They are nice & WIDE !!!  otoh, the Shearling lining is sooo thick, it will likely custom-conform to any foot width- It's snugly / cushy on my wide foot.  I know my wide Euro-feet will eventually squish down the Shearling to fit perfectly- And, I a normal width (or even a slightly narrow foot), would likely just squish the interior fluff to it's owner's foot contours.  Really, it's sooo cushy!  Feels heavenly :b<br /><br />Not realizing how short these Lamo's run, I simultaneously ordered one size smaller for my daughter (sz. 8 Ugg Coquette, size 9 Women's shoe), which seem to be just 1/3&#34; smaller, &  roughly equivalent to size 8 Women's shoe (7 Women's Ugg!)  Although the sizing is super-tiny, the sole is shaped in a fashion such that the big toe area is elongated, for a nice comforming fit to a real human foot.<br /><br />2nd, RE: Lining-  Make sure you get these MERINO Scuffs, otherwise the other models seem to be synthetic fluff-lined.  But, these Merino Scuffs ARE true Shearling / Sheepkin lined (entire interior- Insole & Upper)- When you open the box, they smell like fresh, clean, new wool.  They are off the chain cushy!  Even better than Ugg!  Seriously, they are sooo plush inside!  I haven't worn them (other than try-on), so idk how they'll hold up, but they seem extremely solidly constructed!<br /><br />3rd, RE:  Sole- I haven't worn these yet, other than trying them on, but the sole seems perfectly sturdy, lightweight, & flexible, a bit thinner than my Ugg Coquettes perhaps.<br /><br />4th, RE:  Price/Value-  When I 1st started buying Ugg Coquettes, they were ~ $100... I thought that price was absurd, but b/c I didn't think to comparison shop (until now), I wrongly assumed that Uggs were &#34;the best&#34;, & I convinced myself that they were worth it... If I'm at home, my slippers are on, & I wear them out in the yard, driveway, to mailbox, even as quick teen - taxi Mom (driving)- I've been through 2 pair of Uggs, & the 2nd pair just didn't hold up well- The footbed lining was gone in a month (I had to buy replacement insoles, which work quite well, but cost yet another $20!).  These Lamo's look, feel, and handle like an exquisitely constructed slipper, for 1/3 the price- Repeat- I can get THREE pairs of Lamo's, w/ much more plush lining, for the cost of ONE pair of competition.<br /><br />5th, RE:  Color-  These Lamo's appear so much darker on-line, but, when placed side by side w/ my &#34;Chestnut&#34; Uggs (the standard neutral color, most-sold), these Lamo's appear (nearly) the same shade- OK, I guess 1 shade darker.  I imagine that after wearing & laundering, they too might lighten up a bit in color.  They are NOT nearly as dark as the picture appears, so please don't let the color dissuade you, unless you want a VERY pale shade.  I cook in my slippers- They get olive oil, tomato sauce, & everything imaginable spilled on them- So, a mid-tan neutral color like this Lamo is perfecto!<br /><br />I've included pix of my OLD size 9 Uggs, side by side w/ these NEW size XXL (11-12) Lamo's, for reference.<br /><br />Final thoughts- My only regret is not discovering these earlier!  Also look at &#34;Old Friend&#34; and &#34;Bearpaw&#34; slippers- But, read very carefully- Only select models are real Shearling-lined.  They all seem to run ~ $40-$50.  btw- Lamo offers Men's real Shearling slippers, too (but, reading reviews, they seem to run very small, too).  Hope this helps, if you're on the fence!	2015-08-06

I have just ordered another pair (which will now make 4) as they are so super comfy. They may feel a little weird the first time you put them on (you can see from the pictures that the soles look a little weird), but you'll soon get used to them and realise just how much of a difference they make in everyday walking.<br />These shoes really hold up - I have walked 10+ miles in them on multiple occassions. They have been with me on a regular basis all over San Francisco (if you've been, you know how steep the hills are!!), as well as just every day type of walking situations.<br />As for fit, I would say they are around 1/2 a size smaller than my actual foot size (I am a 7 but the 6.5 fit perfectly). The only exception to this rule was that I bought the natural colored ones, and the material was a lot stiffer than the others I got, so they didn't fit as nicely and I could have done with a 7 instead.<br />I 100% recommend these shoes...you'll find it hard to stray from them once you wear them!	2015-08-06

I bought this &#34;coin purse&#34; for that purpose.  Overall it will work pretty good.  Here are the pro's and con's as I see them:<br /><br />PRO:  Seems to be of sturdy construction.  I like the fact that there are 2 compartments - so I put the credit cards and ID's on one side and the cash on the other.  And the size - while at 5&#34; it is just a wider than I need, overall it definitely works with some room to spare.  Would not want it to be any bigger.  NOTE:  US credit cards are 3.375 inches wide and need at least a 4&#34; opening to fit in.  US currency folded in half is about 3&#34; wide but slightly taller than 2.5&#34;.  So the currency will only fit in a purse that is 2.5&#34; tall if you fold it twice - which thickens it significantly.  I like that with this purse I only need to fold the currency once.<br /><br />CONS:  I received it about a week ago and the strong leather aroma is just beginning to diminish.  Hoping in another month when I take my next trip, the smell is gone.  The leather while sturdy and well sewn, does not feel soft and supple.  Rather it feels thin but sturdy.  I don't think I got high quality leather, but then I did not pay for that either.<br /><br />OVERALL:  For what I want it to do - it will work fine ...... as long as the aroma eventually goes away.  Recommended.	2015-08-06

Before trying the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66, I was strictly a Puma fan for the past 7 years.  I still wear the Puma Drift Cat driving shoes on the weekends and I love them.  However, the Tigers are as good, if not slightly better than the Puma Drift Cats in some categories.  You definitely have more arch support in the Tigers and they are much quieter when walking.  Also, I like that the tongue in the Tigers has the pass-through hole to keep it straight when you're walking.  The Puma's don't have that and the tongue on my left shoe always slides to the left when I walk.  The Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 is a great shoe and I will be a customer of these for years to come.  Now if Onitsuka would only make the Tai Chi Tigers again, i'd be in hog heaven!	2015-08-06

I wear between a 5 and a 6, depending on mfg and width (I'm wide across the toe box).  Got these in a 5.5 and they were good, with just a tiny bit of play (not a visible gap) in the heel area.  I wore them for about 6-7 hours at a SF bay cruise wedding and did end up with a small blister on the back of one heel.  It was SO worth it, though. I got tons of compliments and can't wait to wear them again. The leather is very nice.  I know Nine West isn't a super high-end couture brand, but these feel like I spent much more on them than I did.  I'm back on here to buy them in black.	2015-08-06

My sister is flat footed where I have a high arch and they work perfect for us both.	2015-08-06

However I had to send them back.<br /><br />In the Nano 3.0 I wear a 7.5 and Nano 4.0 I wear an 8.  Based on reviews that stated it is true to size I figured the 8 would fit just like the nano 4 but I was wrong.  It was too small.  If I reorder I need to order an 8.5 so that my toe does not hit the toe box.  I don't have wide feet but these shoes were too small for me.  It was very hard to slip on these shoes.  The tongue of the shoe is attached to the shoe sides so there isn't much give on that.  I loved the color though it was really pretty.  It just doesn't seem as sturdy as the 3 or 4.  They don't feel comfortable on.	2015-08-06

From the picture, the &#34;brown leather&#34; seemed a more natural, rough look... but the actual color was a painted brown.  I did not love it at all.  I even considered taking it back.  I didn't have an alternative purse and the price was right so I kept it.  I'm glad I did.  I just wish it were a more natural leather color.	2015-08-06

Only three months and very little use, my boots began delaminating at the toes.

I tried all sorts of suggested remedies, but I recently came to the conclusion that having arch support all day long would probably be my best bet for allowing my plantar to heal between workouts.  I work from home and don't wear shoes the entire day.  Walking around barefoot seemed to cause more aches and pains in my plantar by the end of the day.  So after doing some research, I decided to splurge and get the Orthaheel Men's Bryce Thong Sandal after seeing great reviews on the product.  I've been running seriously for the past 3+ years and one thing I've learned is to not go cheap on foot wear because that can make a big difference in being able to avoid injury.  So I looked at the Orthaheel sandal as an investment in my well-being as a runner.<br /><br />The first time I tried them on, I was immediately impressed.  The arch support instantly made my feet feel better.  My plantar could relax while I was walking around and it was such a relief!  I have neutral arches and these sandals felt comfortable from the get-go.  No break in period needed.  I wear them all day long now- even when I use the bathroom in the middle of the night, I slip these sandals on to avoid going barefoot at all.  It's been two weeks and I finally feel like I've got a handle on my plantar fasciitis issues.  I highly recommend these sandals!	2015-08-06

[[VIDEOID:6cc453121436a27bd4eaf03b89060e89]]I have to be honest, I got this purse in spite of the alligator pattern as that is normally not my style, but I think it's ended up being one of my favorite aspects of the purse!  The handles are a mixture of pink, white, and blue in an alligator print and I have to admit I'm a huge fan on pink so this has become my favorite new purse.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of small purses so I love the roominess of this purse.  It has two large pockets inside it, with a zippered pouch separating them which I love.  Let's face it, there are just some things you don't want hanging out of your purse, and this middle zippered pouch will keep your private items private! If you aren't a big fan of handles it does come with a removable strap, so it's very versatile.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the little small touches, and when you order this purse it actually comes in a dust bag, which is a nice touch to me.  It also comes with a scented satchel and these cute little clips. Little touches like this definitely make a brand stand out for me, and turn me into a repeat customer.  The quality is phenomenal to me. I received the dark blue bag and it's a little lighter than pictured, but I learned a long time ago there are often shade variances when purchasing items like this online and I'm extremely pleased with this purse!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.	2015-08-06

But I loved the style and could see that these shoes could be very comfortable, so I returned the 36 and then ordered a size up to 37.  Although the footbed was a little bigger, the uppers were not as tight but fit like a glove enough so that the shoes stayed on as I walked and they didn't feel too big at all, plus they were so freaking comfortable. I loved the style and comfort so much that I kept the 37.  One of my favorite pairs now and I always get compliments on them, but minus one star for the tight uppers and I had to reorder a size bigger to remedy that.	2015-08-06

My first thought upon opening the package was &#34;wow, those are kick-ass.&#34;<br />- Amazon's picture doesn't do the shoe justice.  The green material has a great texture.  I was blown away by the interior pattern (something Scottish, right?)<br />- Fit.  I ordered a size 10 and they fit very well (without socks).  For context, I wear the following sizes with socks (unless otherwise noted): 10 (Converse; Influence w/o socks;Timberland; Hugo Boss dress shoes w/ dress socks) and 11 (Allen Edmond w/ dress socks; Tiger; Asics)<br />- Did I mention they look amazing?<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Doesn't look sturdy (why 4 and not 5 stars)<br />- I don't wear socks w/ slip-ons, but if you do, order up a size<br />- Not Prime Eligible and took ~20 days to get to Brooklyn from China.  I forgot I ordered them!<br /><br />I will update the review after I've taken them for more of a spin.	2015-08-06

I had laser eye surgery several years ago and polarized lenses are designed to eliminate reflective glare and to protect against harmful UVA and UVB rays.  Many regular lenses do not do that.<br /><br />I used to only wear a particular name brand polarized lense that I would pay between $150 to $250 for.  I no longer have to shell out a ton of money to get quality sunglasses to protect my now perfect vision eyes.<br /><br />Mambo shades are a quality product that you can trust.  The price is in line with the quality of the product.  I have had the pleasure to test several types of polarized lenses in their wonderful line of sunglasses. I have been completely satisfied with each one.  My pre-teen boys have a favorite pair of their mambo shades too!!<br /><br />*  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-06

I bought a pair of these boots on the recommendation of a co-worker, he said they were extremely comfortable and long lasting.

Also I have very wide feet (4E) and the widest size they make are only 2E. The boots fit snuggly but as long as I don't tie them too tight I can live with them being a little snug.	2015-08-06

I'm not sure what's up with Nine West shoes, but their sizing is so inconsistent. These shoes are so beautiful and they're not uncomfortable because of the heel height since the platform is pretty high, but I can't wear them very long at all because they are TIGHT. My toes are painfully scrunched up in one, but the other fits reasonably well so if I went half a size they'd probably be too big. I guess I'll keep them and see if I can have a cobbler stretch them a bit so I can wear them without wanting to die. Really wish Nine West would figure out their sizing though, since it's impossible to tell whether they'll be too big or too small, but the quality and style for the price are hard to beat.	2015-08-06

I'm starting a new job in the fall where I need shoes that are more professional looking than the running shoes I had been wearing when I teach.  These shoes look much better in person than the picture, and I'm very glad I bought them.  They will serve the purpose of completing my professional wardrobe while being comfortable at the same time.  The insoles are so cushiony, as soon as I slipped them on, I knew I'd made the right decision.  I have an issue with my right foot being a bit wider in the toe area than my left.  If I buy shoes 1/2 size bigger, they are too big, so I bought my normal size.  The shoes fit fine, but I'm still using my stretcher to get just a tinch more toe space in the right shoe.  That is not the manufacturer's fault; that's my foot problem, so I still gave the shoe 5 stars.  I love that they are leather, a good height (can't wear heels for long and flats are uncomfortable). I have a lot of issues with my feet, and I'm picky about the look of the shoes I wear, so I feel I hit the mother lode with these particular shoes.  I'm ready to buy a couple more pair so I have them when these wear out. (I will be wearing them a lot!)	2015-08-06

I own a lot of TOMS (24+ pairs and counting), but these are one of my go-to shoes for every day wear. They are perfect for the beach and summer weather, and the natural color matches with just about anything.<br /><br />As with buying other TOMS, you would need to size down a half to full size because they stretch over time. One thing to consider, however, is that that TOMS shoes are notoriously inconsistent in sizing. That means that you can buy 2 pairs of the exact same shoes, and one pair can be CONSIDERABLY larger than the other, even though in theory, they should both be the exact same size. In fact, I have even received TOMS where one shoe is noticeably larger than the other inside the same shoe box. This means that if you KNOW you are a size 5 in Toms, and the shoes you received are too big or too small, you may want to try another size 5 again because the pair you received may have just been &#34;off.&#34; Luckily, Amazon has an awesome return policy, so exchanging is never a problem.<br /><br />I will be going to Europe soon, and these crochet TOMs along with the glitter silver ones are coming along with me!	2015-08-06

For this price, the quality cannot be compared to boots like it of the $100-250 range, in construction. However, I think it is worth the lower cost to get the style. i have seen these elsewhere for $50. They are worth $35 but not $50. Also, after wear some studs fell off. they are just pushed on. they can be replaced, but I didnt do so because the sole tore anyhow. This is my second pair not used yet. For me they do not run small one bit, however my feet are bony and thin. Really wide feet might have issues, average should not, thin should not. if 71/2 fits you just this end of too small get an 8, if it fits you perfectly stay with 71/2 UPDATE- i changed my rating to lower,after several months, the sole and heel area tore open, because they are constructed badly and hollow inside. I wanted to get more of this brand, but both pair I ordered have dinner the same thing. I like the look and price, but I have boots of similar price range that have not fallen apart like these did. I cannot recommend these due to this shoddy heel. I have changed my rating now because of this.	2015-08-06

I love the color, size and the shoulder or crossbody strap option.  I have had trouble finding bags with the shoulder and crossbody straps in the past, so I really appreciate this feature.  I have also had trouble finding this dark brown &#34;coffee&#34; color in the past year, so I was thrilled to discover the Scarleton brand last month which seems to offer lots of its bags in this color.  This is a large bag, but it doesn't appear like an overnight bag, gym bag or carry-on.  I find the size perfect for my needs.  I can pack everything I normally bring with some room to spare... for example: large wallet, 5&#34;x7&#34; 100-page tablet and pen, glasses, standard plastic pencil box, 16 ounce water bottle and baseball cap.  The bag has a good number of compartments for organizing, and each compartment is a reasonable size.  This is a floppy bag, made with a very soft synthetic leather which I like, but if you are looking for structure it does not have it. The only thing I would actually change about this bag is the black paint on the buckles.  I wish it was the same silver color as the rest of the buckle.  However, the color scheme of the buckles matches the brand label in the center so it still looks good. It was also a very good price.  I am thrilled to have found this bag and this brand!	2015-08-06

"[[VIDEOID:28f16a85f3bfd888c64707d86aa0b631]] I got the BG® Women Alligator Pattern Gold Accents Shoulder Strap PU Leather Tote Style Handbags in the dark blue and I Love it. Great Color for the soon approaching fall-winter months. Good Quality handbag, very well made & very spacious. The bag measures 12.99\\\" Wide X 10.23\\\\\" in Height X 5.51\\\\\" Diameter. You have one main top zipper for the bag, And on the inside you have 2 zippered compartment & 2 open pocket compartments. And Also comes with a Longer adjustable strap for carrying cross-body or over the shoulder.<br />The bag is well designed and made & seems rather durable that will last a good while. I like the Alligator Pattern short straps, adding a rather designer look to the bag & the gold hardware also adds to the look for sure. It is Fully Lined! I'm glad I received this to test out in exchange for my honest review. Overall it's a good quality Bag & functions really well & provides a whole lot of space which is great from me having small kids I have a lot of stuff to carry around so it works great for me. All the zippers work smoothly & do not jam or anything. Very Satisfied!"	2015-08-06

These provide quite a lot of cushion. The arch support isn't 5 stars, but the cushion in the entire foot bed makes up for it. I have very high arches and I wore these shoes for HOURS at a trade show walking miles on concrete. My feet felt just fine.I bought these in red - which is a fun color. I've worn them with classy black dresses when I needed to take a break from pumps and they worked great. I've also worn them countless times with old jeans, casual skirts and even shorts. I will be buying another pair in a more neutral tone. HIGHLY recommend these awesome shoes.	2015-08-06

The toe trap that separates the big toe from the all the others is in the middle, not to the side, which kind of makes you entire foot not sit on the slipper correctly. My pinky toe definitely hangs off the slipper and there's a good amount of open space next to my big toe that could've been used!<br />2. The strap is tiiiiiiiiiiiight. Even without tabi socks on. I'm 6.5-7 US womens and I had slip as much of my foot on there as possible, then tap the tip of the slipper against the floor to get it the rest of the way on. Just ack!<br /><br />So I guess if you're gonna go for these, go a size up at the very least.I have tiny feet but even my heels were hanging over some! If the strap was better placed and a bit looser, I think my feet would fit just fine but yeah...some design problems. Probably going to return and look for a better pair  than try to go a size up, sadly. =(	2015-08-06

Buy Buy Buy!!!	I know, with so many cheap knockoff out there its hard enough deciding which one to choose from the plethora of choices out there! After 15 mins of intensive research and 2 delicious orange juice I decided on this product. Keep in mind that I love Ray Ban sunglasses but lately I am in the market for other alternatives but would still like to stay in the the context of the same style that Ray Ban iconic Wayfarer. I received the product which came in a cool bamboo tube which I thought was pretty unique and upon taking out my sunglass...they were everything that I expected it to be and boy did it look exactly like my Ray Ban but...shhh (I'm a little tired of Ray Ban) they are made from more sustainable source which I think is the trend these day and why not not use bamboo source...they're awesome! I have them in my car as it is mostly used for my daily driving in the gorgeous California sun specifically the bay area. They are polarized!!! Don't let anyone else fool you! They do a real good job at this and for this price compared to a Ray Ban (Brand Recognition), I think I will be getting another pair or two and since I have a engraving tool, I'am so going to etch my own personal logo!	2015-08-06

I absolutely loved the Pace Glove 2 and the PG 3 is slightly better in some ways. Somewhere between the PG 2 and 3 is the best shoe you can ever imagine. I like the aesthetics of the PG 3, but it's possible the PG 2 version was very slightly better.<br /><br />What makes this shoe so special, is not merely the low weight -  these shores weigh almost nothing - but they way they allow my hooves to communicate with the ground. In terms of being able to move biomechanically efficiently, there is nothing like them that I know of that are this good. I have a particular need for a specific shoe for tai chi.<br /><br />This shoe, both versions, handle both slow tai chi, and fast tai chi unbelievably well. If I compare them to shoes that do not have this design, then, these shoes actually advantage my tai chi slightly, versus shoes that do not or make it harder to feel the ground forces and internal kinetics of movement as you move. But as with anything, if you are not ready for a shoe of this type, then it's only going to augment your tai chi so far.<br /><br />This is more for Merrell's Design Staff than customers, but you have a unique shoe here of great value to someone with the right set of needs or wants. I can't imagine bothering to wear anything else unless I absolutely had to. I already own three pair of the black PG 3 and had two pair of the black and pink PG 2 until I lost one pair. Please consider making at least one model of the Pace Glove in black every year or season. Maybe you guys would be willing to do a limited production run or something, to make ten or so pairs of Pace Glove 3 with the Vibram sole from the PG 2, and the interior color, and external pink striping and laces which looks very nice. and then use the same mesh and taping techniques from the PG 3, on the hybrid model. That would be the best shoe that ever graced my hooves. Until next time.	2015-08-06

They looked great, the soles were comfortable, and the toe box was wide enough to wear all day comfortably. Unfortunately, One boot was too narrow at the bridge of my foot.

This is only the second pair of regular canvas TOMS. One pair was sequined, the other way one of the limited edition kinds that is made of a different fabric (not sure which fabric it was). Depending on which fabric they're made from seems to determine how they fit. These canvas ones are very narrow across the top of my foot, rubbing and pinching. I order a 9.5 at first, but they were pinchy, so I ordered a 10. The 10 is better, but still tight across the top of my fit... but not also a bit long. My first pair were the most comfortable shoes I owned for a while, but these new ones I just got are some of the most uncomfortable. When they fit right, they feel so nice. When they fit poorly, it's really bad. It's hit or miss with these.	2015-08-06

They are incredibly lightweight and offer great traction. Just read the Outdoorgearlab.com reviews. This is by far the best pair of boots for the price on the market.

I normally wear a 9 or 9.5 W, and I decided to order the 9.5 EW for a little extra room. They fit perfectly. Like the others, I suggest you order at least a half size larger and one normal width larger, but don't go crazy with it. They just aren't that far off. It's a good looking shoe, nice soft leather, comfortable liner, and fits well. Couldn't ask for more.	2015-08-06

The heel is solid which helps with support for longer wear. They have a slight soft insole which is great, and the material is soft which resulted in no painful rubbing or chaffing. (None of which I have experienced.) They do run narrow, which for me is fine. I have super narrow feet. The Velcro strap is nice for adjustment, however to put the strap through the loop can be a bit clumsy as it catches on the Velcro. I am a solid 6 1/2 in shoes and 6 in heels. I ordered the 6 1/2 based off the reviews, and am very glad I did...the 6 would of been tight. The color I purchased in &#34;Brown&#34; has red undertones.  Overall- great purchase!	2015-08-06

Only issue is that it comes with a cloth case (I bought an Oakley hard case) and that they are soooooo expensive.

I wear a size 9.5 in Nike's (universal standard).  I started wearing Cats work boots because my first pair of Second Shift boots lasted me a couple years through some tough use and abuse and I wore a 8.5 in those.  Then I found the Caterpillar Men's Streamline Comp Toe Running Shoe,Medium Charcoal, and I figured on getting a size 9 regular width.  It fit too narrow around the toes and after a couple hours felt really uncomfortable.  Of course by then I had worn them to the point of no return.  That was a year ago and I&#34;ve had to deal with the discomfort long enough and it's time for  a new pair so I found these Caterpillar Men's Brode Hi ST Work Boot,Black,and decided to get 9.5 regular width.  Still too narrow.  It's not the size, it's the width.  Now I am convinced that I should have gotten a 9.5 wide.  Anyway, I had bought these shoes on a Amazon lightning deal, and now that I have to return it, I don't know if there is a way to get the same price from the lightning deal in a different size.  I hope Amazon sees this comment and sends me a response.  Update 8/11/15:  I returned the regular width and got the wide width version.  Amazon did honor the lightning deal price, so kudos to them for providing excellent customer service.  Now on to the shoe.  Even the wide width version is too narrow at the toes.  It did seem wider at the midsole, but that's not where I need it wider.  It felt like Cat used the same steel toe as the regular width version, so it pretty much defeated the purpose of getting the wider width!  I really like the style of the shoe.  the black leather and red stitching is really bad a55, but too bad they couldn't get the sizing right.  I'm going to try the Reebok Leelap's as I have read reviews that those offer generous toe box.	2015-08-06

When I read the reviews, I thought some of them were over zealous.  Well, let tell you - these are nothing short of awesome.  They are very light.  The cleat design is flawless.  I literally walked/ran up steep muddy hills in the race passing other racers who were struggling to get traction.  Amazing.  The high tops did not allow the shoe to come off even when my leg was stuck in mud up to my knee.  There was only one time in the entire race where I slipped, and I fully expected it.  If you run on trails, you cannot go wrong with these.  Hose them off and you are ready for the next run/race.  I cannot imagine anything better.	2015-08-06

Everyone really liked these shoes though and ask where i got them.	2015-08-06

I am really liking these glasses.  I needed a pair for cycling, for both road and mountain, which were light, stayed in place, and had clear optics.  I looked at some more expensive brands in the $200-300 range, and just could not bring myself to spend that when the probability of a crash on the mountain bike is always in the back of my mind when doing the real technical stuff (This is how I have scratched the lens on two pairs already over the past couple of years).  I also really like the fact that these don't have a frame bar across the top of the glasses allowing for a better view of the road while I am down on the drops on my road bike, and they are really light weight.

Other than that, these shoes are absolutely adorable and just what I was looking for style-wise. Can dress them up or down. Definitely get these if you have petite feet!!	2015-08-06

I really wanted short rain boots and thought this was the answer - I was wrong.  They were so tight.  My arch is high on top and my feet were in pain by the end of the day (or sooner).  I felt suffocated in them and ultimately gave them away after trying to make them fit for a couple of months.  Unless you have tiny feet, I would not recommend these.

I thought I'd take a chance since they are extremely well reviewed both here and on Zappos, but I didn't like them at all. All the reviews that said they run big? I'm not sure that's correct. I measured thrice and rounded down to the 9 based on many reviewers' recommendation, but it didn't work for me. I'm not reordering in a size 10 because my foot is a little bit wide and I think these would still be too narrow. They are adjustable, but I think it looks odd to have them only partially tightened. The design on the bed of the shoe is nice and it had nice enough padding -- certainly much better than most flip flops, but doesn't compare to even my 3-year old, worn-nearly-everyday (winter & water) Merrells. The material on the top of the shoe is shinier than I'd like and too plastic looking for my tastes.	2015-08-06

They are the best shoes I have ever purchased. I wear them five days a week and walk an average of 5 miles each day in them and they are holding up perfectly.

I bought these because I am new to running and wasn't quite ready to make the plunge into a $100 pair of shoes.<br />These are a MAJOR difference from the walking shoes I was in before! Very comfortable, soft, good support.<br />Now, I've never worn another pair of running shoes, so all I have to compare is my walking shoes. But the toe box on these are very roomy. It did not expect that at all. Personally, I don't care for that, because I keep catching my toes curling because it feels loose there. But once I relax my toes, its back to smooth sailing.<br />And they're cute to boot.	2015-08-06

More recently I've had trouble with my feet such as a heel spur, plantar fasciatis and pain in my ankle.  My job has placed demands on my legs and feet and I am paying the price for it now. Supporting the feet in good arch and heel supports helps to align to the legs and has made a difference in my tolerance to stand and walk for longer periods.

I noticed that the left shoe seemed it fit funny after the first or second wear, and as I'm wearing them today, I realize that it's because the sole of the shoe (right above the ball of the foot) is broken on the inside. I've had shoe heels break before, but I've never had the center of the shoe break in a way which makes it very difficult and uncomfortable to try and wear the show - whenever my left foot makes contact with the ground, the shoe's natural response is to buckle under, since the stability has been thrown off by the break. If I had had a wonderful experience with my other Ivanka Trump shoes, I would write this off as a fluke, but I feel like the quality has gone downhill, which the price has stayed the same.  I will not be purchasing these shoes again, and unfortunately, there didn't seem to be an outlet to reach out to 6PM to discuss replacement options.	2015-08-06

I bought them after trying a similar pair of Keen's that my friend had, and finding that they seemed to run narrow, which is what I need.  They indeed fit my skinny foot very nicely, and of course they have all the bungee adjustments, as well.  While they do not have a significant visible arch support, the design is such that the shoe hugs the arch nicely and feels solid.  The footbed is quite comfortable - not memory foam, but really nice for a waterproof sandal.  I've been wearing them for about 6 weeks, several long days, as well as boating/soaking wet and they are great.  I do wonder how they will smell after several more soaking wet events, but I'm hopeful!  They dried out nicely, very fast in the sun, and overnight when it was rainy.	2015-08-06

They run just a half size large in my experience. The material is sturdy, and will require some working in to maximize comfort. For instance, due to the lack of a natural crease along to top portion of the boot, the material rebounds with each step. This was at first quite annoying, but became both less noticeable and less significant as I wore them more and more. Be forewarned that the soles are made of rubber, and they will squeak mercilessly on tile flooring. Overall, I am quite satisfied with this boot. It filled my needs well, and is being sold for an excellent price that seems to closely parallel its quality.	2015-08-06

Pretty much as expected; the product description isn't fully accurate. (The product description says “Made in US”. A large tag inside clearly states “Made in China”. Believe it or don’t, this was one criterion in my choice.) The bag isn’t *quite* as big as our older x-small which they’ve quit making—we have one—and which has one large velcro-fastened flap pocket where this one has two smaller mag-snap ones (neither of which will hold an iPhone 6 Plus). The same day I received it, I filed for a return. (I won't go into the problems UPS has had handling the return—severe, off topic, and I hope it doesn't hinder my pricey refund.) Maybe you'll like this bag: it fits a certain niche: just not mine.	2015-08-06

And trust me, with my flat feet, and a bunionectomy done on each foot, they really make my feet feel more comfortable a little bit longer. My old pair and the new pair do.<br />Overall, they are still comfy, and they were a great bargain. Downside are the laces being too short.

After 500 miles the insoles wore a hole and I switched to super feet that helped support my feet as well. The grip of the shoes are incredible. The durability of the boot is great as well. I have seen people use over 5 pairs of shoes out on the AT. They are not the most comfortable for walking around in but for hiking something more firm is great for not feeling every little rock.	2015-08-06

I called Timberland to return the boots and explained the reason and she informed me that this style maybe the exception as being sized as wide but fit as narrow.  If that is the case their product across the line are not standardized, i.e. size wide is should be wide and not narrow, and size narrow should be narrow.  If not, it's a hit or miss to buy their product.  Other than this, the boots are of good quality and if not for the reason expressed, the boots have a natural step to them even out of the box and I feel would have no break-in period. She gave me an return material authorization (RMA), but a day afterwards I cancelled the RMA because I managed to cushion my small toes so that they do not crimp badly and are acceptable to walk my dog. I chose these boots because they are rated water proof, but as of yet it has not rained in central Texas in over 35 days.  If they fix their sizing at the toes, these boots would definitely be five stars. One more thing, do not return these boots by way of Amazon because OutdoorEquipped is the shipper and their return policy applies. If the fault is not their doing they may charge up to 20% stocking fee and charge you for the original shipping cost that will be applied against your refund.  Instead call Timberland because they have a &#34;during first 30 days of no questions ask&#34; policy return on their Powerfit series footwear, but do it within two (2) days of the end of the 30-day test period. But the refund does not include applicable taxes and/or shipping charges for return and they require receipts.	2015-08-06

I do love these shoes - it was just what I was looking for and they are beautiful.  I've had them for 8 months, and wear them almost once a week and they are comfortable and well designed.  The material is still all holding together after all the wear and tear that I've put them through.  Seriously, I will probably purchase these same shoes again when these get too poor to continue wearing.  I love these! I can wear these all day at a 10 hour/day job and my feel still feel alright at the end of the day.  Granted, I don't walk a super lot during the day, but on average I walk anywhere from 4,000-6,000 steps.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.	2015-08-06

They look great but I've never had shoes that actually cut into the insides of your feet before. The uppermost inner stitch on the rear part of the elastic protrudes directly thru your socks and into your feet...making them bleed. Forget wearing them without socks. I'm not kidding. Maybe they changed their design or whatever but these are hands down, the worst shoes I've ever purchased. I even tried to clamp/press the offending nubbin flat with a Quick Grip clamp with little success. Perhaps after suffering through a few months of wearing them things will change but so far, one month into wearing them, they deserve the most poorly designed modern shoe award ever. Good penance shoes to go along with a horsehair shirt.	2015-08-06

I bought this for $60 in my country. It was not worth it.<br /><br />The hard little tab at the ankle of the shoe stabbed my ankle to a bleeding cut. I thought I could walk home with it, but I had to cut it with scissors to lessen the pain a little bit. My ankles are dark and full of scabs right now because of this.<br /><br />I used a soldering iron to melt out the hard plastic tab so that it would fit my foot.

And they look quite dorky with socks, but I couldn't find any (what are they called - mini-socks? liners?) that went high enough, even though I bought some loafer-style ones.

For the price, the shoes are good. The only problem is the strong smell of some chemical found in the materials used to produce these Chinese-made shoes. I've had them outside airing out for a week, and still the chemical smell is strong. I'm going to a wedding where many people will be packed into a room -- what do I do when they start making faces?	2015-08-06

I purchased a 7 extra-wide, but they were not wide enough. I thought the shoe itself was really cute though. I normally purchase stride rite because they offer extra wide sizes, which have fit my son perfectly. I wanted to try a more affordable option since stride rite is expensive, but these did not work out.	2015-08-06

I bought this shoe for my elderly father to bring him some relief from the swelling in his feet. It fit fine in the width, but for some reason the length of the shoe was longer than average, making it slightly too big for him. I solved this with some thick diabetic socks which seem to have fixed the problem. My only concern was slippage while he walks, but so far we have not had an issue with this. The shoe is attractive and very well-made. They look more expensive than what they are, so that's a nice plus!	2015-08-06

They fit like most other running shoes on the market, as far as I can tell, but have a much better arch support. Oddly, I have tried a few other Salomon hiking shoes and boots with the OrthoLite sole but they never quite felt right, this shoe, however, is heavenly for my feet. So, I would suggest trying them on before you buy them if at all possible, even if you have other Salomon OrthoLite products.<br /><br />I opted for the CS version this time because I have had a few instances of wet feet while camping with the regular version so it made sense when I finally wore out the regular pair I had. As other commenters have noted, these will not last long on paved streets, they belong on an unpaved trail. On pavement or hard flooring the treads will wear down significantly in a matter of weeks (~&#60;2 weeks). Since I wear mine mostly on trails I got a good 8 months of heavy use out of the regular 3s. Also, until the tread does wear down it is so aggressive under the forefoot that it will hurt to walk on hard surfaces for extended periods.	2015-08-06

Merrill is a great known brand for hiking and good walking. I looked at several styles and while the ventilator models were good they seemed to let in too much moisture, this one had a nice look, good protection anti-roll for the ankles, and good padding for a walking shoe. They are $10 cheaper just due to the fact they do not have the name brand &#34;Vibram&#34; outer grip on the bottom but the present outer sole is great. My foot is narrow but is larger at the toes which tends to give me blisters, but Merrell adds a touch a extra width in the ball and toe area and these fit like a glove, are lightweight, and comfortable for a full day of walking.  They are not waterproof and in winter you may wish to switch to about or a waterproof version, but for long walks in Asia, Europe and beyond these are terrific. It is answer model for Merrell and we will see how long the interior sole lasts, but Merrell makes it easy to slip in a new sole.	2015-08-06

Size 3 was too snug (my toes were a little uncomfortable because they were kind of squished) and the 4 is way too big. I agree with other reviewers that this is a very clunky shoe. Maybe it looks that way because I have a slim frame, but compared it with other Docs and the Flora boot is visibly chunkier. When not on the foot, the shoes look super sleek. Since the shaft is sort of high, it will hurt your heel unless you wear tall socks, especially when going down stairs. The boot itself is also really stiff, although that might just be the way it's supposed to be. After wearing them consistently for almost two weeks, my toes, the bridge of my foot, and my heel still hurt. I hope these eventually stop hurting my feet, because I do like them, even if they do make my feet look huge.	2015-08-06

I like how there are holes for air circulation, and i LOVE how the clasp is actually just velcro (less work for me to get it on her). the reason why i knocked off one star is that these shoes are a little heavy. they seem comfortable enough, but my daughter is only 3 and these are definitely her heaviest shoes. i take them off as soon as we get in the car because of the weight, although she's never complained.	2015-08-06

These ankle boots are conformable, versatile with a kick of autumn flare, and they fit true to size (for a wide-feet individual). As you see in these photos, there is room around the ankle, which is a plus and preferable to me because it helps me flex my ankle when I walk, and for that I'm happy! For I have wide feet, I usually struggle to fit in boots size 7.5M-9M, especially boots with almond-toe design. So I was literally happy when my feet could fit comfortably in these shoes in size 8M (width: 3-5/8- 3.75 inches; length: 10 inches). The footbed is wide, the vamp is roomy. I think I'd be able to go 1/2 a size down without trouble. Therefore, if you have wide feet like I do, I'd suggest to with your true boots size or the smallest size of your boots-size range. If you have narrower feet or slender feet, I'd recommend to go at least 1 size down. These boots are a steal!	2015-08-06

I like the shoes, they're not my favorite in the world.

It does, however, have a high-abrasion material at the heel and the toe.  The upper is breathable mesh, and the lacing system is standard...with good ol' flat laces.	2015-08-06

I have some flat boots and I like these better in comparison because they do give you a little lift.  I brought these to Chicago in the Winter time because if I wear some warm socks they are kind of like fancy snow boots.  I would not wear on ice - I didn't test this too much, but generally not a good idea if you are wearing a wedge boot.  The color is alright if you like fake leather grey coloring, but they go with a lot of my clothes.  I might not be able to wear them all day, but did for several hours and several miles sightseeing in Chicago.  I did that after I had worn them for several months, so they were broken in!	2015-08-06

These are slightly larger than the really small kiddie sunglasses, but they're smaller than for adults.  Nice to have if you like to keep a bunch of extra shades on hands.  Most kids lose them anyway, or leave them here or there, so it's a good idea to have inexpensive ones in the car and other places so you have them when you need them, and you don't worry if they're lost, because they didn't cost a fortune.

Very well made, too.  However, the front panel is somewhat narrow for my otherwise standard width feet.  The interior seam of the front panel kept rubbing against the top of my feet.  Not comfortable at all.  Flexx tends to run smaller and narrower compared to other brands.  I went 1/2 size up and it didn't help much.  A whole size up would have been too long in length.  Unless I want to use the shoe genie again to expand the shoes like what I did with my first pair of Flexx, I would not consider keeping it.	2015-08-06

I should note that my feet are slightly wide, so this might not be the best choice for someone with a really narrow foot, because this fits me perfectly width-wise. Normal width and slightly wide-footed gals should scoop these up. I have these in the nude patent and the black suede...for some reason, the black suede feels way more comfortable than the nude patent, but they're both great, and for someone with problem feet like me, the fact that I can run around in them all day at work and only have my feet swell up minimally at night when I go home (which happens with everything except sneakers), it's pretty awesome. I've also worn the black ones out to dinner with a moderate amount of walking to/from the restaurant and the train, and my feet were fine (which is amazing b/c I never walk around in heels -- I wear flats and change into heels for work or events). I wish they had the teal suede in my size! The only slight issue is that my foot does sometimes slip out of the back (only on one foot, the one that's slightly smaller), but I think I can fix this easily with a heel grabber from my shoe repair place.	2015-08-06

They conform to the shape and wear of your feet as you wear them over time. As a flat-footed person with very finicky feet, I love this brand and basic style. Be sure not to wear them outside, though, even briefly (unless you buy a model which has a rubber outer sole) as this will shorten their life considerably. As always, pure wool breathes; it's warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Great investment for winter home comfort and self-care.	2015-08-06

I was initially pleased with the shoe, but over the past months, the shoe became simply unwearable.  Note that I have purchased many shoes in my days, and although I'm not much of a runner anymore, at one time I was very picky about my shoes.  I have had shoes I loved, and shoes that were just ok, but I have to say that this is the first pair that I had to stop wearing because of what it was doing to my feet.  This shoe has NO support whatsoever.  Maybe if you are flat-footed, this shoe is right for you.  I've never had a New Balance shoe before .... so maybe that manufacturer is just a bad match for me.  I have written many reviews here on Amazon, and 99% of them are positive, but I can't recommend this shoe.	2015-08-06

I liked these so much from what I could see online that I ordered one pair to try and added a few in different colors to my cart to select from later. It only took trying them on quickly to notice that these are narrow, pointed and have an uncomfortably tight elastic strap inside the top to keep them on since the laces are loose. Several spots inside rub and the back is unsupportive so that it slips on the heel. For me, there could hardly be a more disappointing shoe. I  see from other reviews that some people like them but I was thanking goodness for Amazon returns. I have a pair of leather Sperry Top-Sider Angelfish which are cute but they have given me blisters on the heel; at least they  sort of fit and these shoes are a full size larger and feel so narrow, tight and rough.	2015-08-06

The soles seem to be made of a new material, and the leather uppers have a different appearance than what I'm used to.  I have owned at least six pair of Sperry &#34;Original&#34; Topsiders over the decades.  The original US-Made quality was great - the soles of a 30+ year old pair are still intact.  My several Chinese &#34;originals&#34;  have varied tremendously in quality.  The soles of my most recent Chinese pair are crumbling into tiny pellets of hard plastic that scatter all over the floor - I've worn them as indoor slippers exclusively for two years as they are too fragile to wear outdoors.  I keep two other pair as beach shoes, and they have not disintegrated as badly despite sand, salt, and age.  I spoke to a company rep a few years ago to complain about the stitching coming apart, and he was the one who told me they'd been making shoes in China for at least 10 years.  &#34;Originally&#34; Sperry was an American company.  They've disintegrated from being a quality shoemaker crafting one good shoe into an international joke manufacturing dozens (hundreds?) of low quality &#34;styles&#34;.  ORIGINAL?

The B width fits only slightly more snug, but it makes a difference, especially in the heel. Significant yet unobtrusive stability is built into these shoes, but Asics has reduced the amount arch support with each successive integration of the Gt-2000 line. So, for an even better fit, I swap out the insoles with Spenco Total Support.  For long training runs, the combination is about as close to perfect as I've found.  While the foot-to-ground transistion comfort is as good as it gets on uneven terrain, one downside is that it takes some fussing with the lacing to get the instep tolerable without being too loose. Also, the shiny-white plastic-looking color scheme is a bummer.  I wish Asics would make the B width in a more neutral and/or stylish gray or black like the trail version, but they don't.

I wear these all day long while I am at home, and on my feet a good part of the day.(I am retired). They feel cushioney and so comfortable, almost like barefoot. These have a flexible bottom, unlike the black Cudas thongs I have that are wide fabric on the top and a more rigid bottom, although also very comfortable. These are my 3rd pair of this brand and I have not been disappointed. When you compare prices on other flip flops, these are very well priced for the good quality and comfort they provide. These are a very neutral taupe-beige color.	2015-08-06

Living on the coast of California, I hardly wear shoes.  I have become accustom to walking barefoot and the unique challenges that one might face when doing away with traditional shoes (actually wearing typical athletic shoes hurts, a lot!).  I purchased these shoes to wear while I coach gymnastics, because let's face it... kids can be disgusting and who knows what stuff they track into a large gym.  The shoes are great, I can still maintain a near barefoot tactile feel with my feet, something that is important in gymnastics.  The shoes also add minimal weight to my feet so, when I demonstrate advanced flipping and twisting skills there isn't a requirement to adjust for the added weight and limitations a traditional athletic shoe offers.  I have even had other coaches in the gym inquire about these shoes, and as a result they have grown in popularity throughout the staff.  Sure there are other &#34;bare foot&#34; shoes out there for a better price point, but these have been some of the best shoes I have found as of late.	2015-08-06

I have had these now for over 2 years, and I can't suggest these glasses enough.  I've had various sunglasses over the course of 5 - 6 years, and I can say with a good degree of certainty that these glasses are the best investment I ever made.<br /><br />They fit very well, and even cover the sides of my eye so that there is no sunlight directly hitting my eye in any way.  I have worn these for 8 - 12 hours without taking them off, and they do a great job with protecting my eyes.<br /><br />After some elongated use I did notice that the piece that sits on the ear does start to apply pressure to where it's sitting on the ear (after about an hour or so), and it can be slightly painful, but a quick adjustment of the glasses alleviates this. I wish there was some sort of padding or something that would help reduce this, but overall it's a minor issue.<br /><br />Through the years the lenses have gotten mildly scratched up, because of my own usage and storage ineptitude (I had no idea you shouldn't put them in your pocket), but had I purchased a hard case for them, they probably would still look brand new.  Although I try extremely hard to care for these glasses, and generally take great care of them, these have been dropped a couple of times.  However, there is absolutely no evidence of their collision with the ground.<br /><br />These glasses are durable and absolutely worth the money and will last a very long time.<br /><br />Note - I purchased the polarized version of these glasses, as I wanted the glare protection and UV protection associated with the lenses.  I have not worn the non-polarized versions, except in the store, but I would highly suggest to get polarized.  It's worth the upgrade in money, and you'll notice a huge difference.	2015-08-06

They cushion your foot and give excellent support for both the arches and the ankles. I walk/hike 7 days a week, getting in 3-5 miles per day on weekends when the hubby comes with me, and 5-8miles per day on weekdays. And when I remove my shoes when I get home, it's not because my feet hurt, but because I want to allow them to dry or because they need to be cleaned. These are one of the best walking shoes I've found...comfortable straight out of the box with no break in period needed, no rubbing, no sore spots. And what I like the most about them is that they're leather...so there are no rips or tears like I get with fabric shoes. One good sticker-bearing vine that gives a tug on my foot could result in a tear on shoes with fabric or mesh on the uppers...but with leather, those same vines just slide off of them. Which equates to a much longer shoe life. I'm averaging about 800 miles on a pair, and by then I replace them not because they're worn out, but because, being leather they don't breath well, and become rather smelly.  Lol However, I just purchased a shoe dryer that I'm hoping will alleviate that problem, too.	2015-08-06

I love the step in style because I have spinal problems, also these will not randomly slide off of your foot, so they are pretty safe for one who is high risk for falls.

I have tried a bunch of other walking sandals and the Vionic Muir is definitely the best because they have really good arch support. At last a sandal that I can wear all day and really do some walking, sightseeing, etc. in without worrying about too much foot pain. I have some Tevas which are very adjustable but the arch support is not as good as the Muir's. I got the navy blue and they look much better on than they do in the picture. They aren't too heavy, the straps adjust well and don't irritate to tip of my foot. Not a fashion sandal but they look fine with shorts, capris, etc.	2015-08-06

They are super comfortable from day one...didnt feel discomfort at all. Im breaking them in now, through Summer  although its technically a Winter boot , my feet do not feel too warm.

US	48204392	R307PYDP7OF8JB	B00W5VQM7C	434772909	Maui Shore Mens Slide Sandal	Shoes	5	0	0	N	Y	Well-Made, Comfortable, Waterproof	They're great stepping into 'no-hands' while carrying stuff. My last pair (different brand/similar style) lasted over 6 years until I slipped one day to avoid stepping on the dog and tore the top band off.  I'm an 11 1/2&#34; wide and settled for a 12, but it's not a problem: It pays to experiment and find the best setting for the Velcro top band - then leave it there. I want a fit that I can comfortably step into, yet is tight enough the sandals won't come off while going up and down stairs (I really hate that).  I use them inside and out and don't have to worry they'll get wet or dirty - they're really easy to keep clean.  Bottom Line: A little pricier than other brands but I like the design and think the workmanship is worth it.	2015-08-06
US	45128719	R2SNOCPNZR5I2	B0098IKIT8	15839987	New Balance Men's MX857 Cross-Training Shoe	Shoes	1	0	0	N	N	I've had some great new balance products	I bought mine at the new balance store locally. I've had some great new balance products, until this shoe.  They didn't have my size in stock, so I let them have it shipped to my house. It came with a hole under the insole and not all the eyelets cut out. I returned them, they sent me another. They arrived fine, but 3 months later the leather on the side was tearing at the stitching. They replaced them.  Again 3 months later the leather was tearing at the side. They decided they had me in the wrong size,replaced with different size, no problems for 6 more months. I was very understanding and really appreciative of all the replacements, heck I've bought at least 6 other pairs there prior, no issues. After 6 months the glue that holds the shoe to the upper quit.  On the side of the left shoe, the toe of the right, big holes.<br /><br />Anyway, that was the only time I tried the 857. I had really wanted a black leather laceup and that was the best option at the time. Now that I needed to replace the 857, they have another choice. I got the 1540, so far the quality seems much better. This is the only chance they get. I should have pushed them to replace the 857 again, they look brand new still, except where the glue let go.	2015-08-06

I am an extremely difficult fit due to a narrow heel, somewhat flat arch and average toe width. Aravon is one of the few brands that I can adjust to fit comfortably -- their shoes feel great and look great. However, most of Aravon is extremely casual. This style, the Mila, has a nice heel (not too high, but high enough to look dressy). I am ecstatic to find a shoe that I can walk for miles in yet looks dressy, and beautiful. I love the colors of the leather -- so unique.	2015-08-06

I did not wear them and they weren't comfortable. there's no cushioning though there's a useless insert. The shoes don't hurt or anything, but my toe almost touches the front of the shoe, and you can't walk over rough terrain with shoes that have sloppy fit on heel and ankle, and your toe rubs the shoe on the down hill.  Its a recipe for disaster. Also, the shoe feels &#34;flat&#34;, not supportive. there's no feeling of cushioning , the insert has no support I and I am extremely disappointed because I thought that I wanted this particular shoe.	2015-08-06

Online research for best support all suggested Dansko clogs. Somewhat skeptical of the clog idea. Clogs? Daughter's an RN at a large hospital, worn Dansko's forever, swears by them. Asked her if any MEN wear them. She laughed. Yes, many do. Nothing particularly feminine about a black / brown clog. No one notices or cares. They allow you to be on your feet all day on hard surfaces.  Great advice.<br /><br />Plusses: By far the best support I've ever had. Feet no longer hurt at the end of the shift. Initially tight across the top, loosened up quickly. Have worn many big-name support shoes over the years, these top them all.<br /><br />Caveat:  2&#34; heels had a learning curve. Walking's not bad, but lateral movements were a challenge. Moving side to side (between bays) took some practice. Now easy.<br /><br />Non-verified purchase, came from E/Bay.<br />Next pair (very soon!) will come from Amazon, they're available in extra width, a plus. Need just a bit more wiggle room in the toes.	2015-08-06

Please don't suffer from this debilitating condition.  I'm a retired EMT who had this problem more than 20 years ago.  There's such a simple fix.  Go to an orthopedic surgeon for an outpatient procedure.  He/She will make a small incision probably less than 1&#34; and cut the nerve that is giving you all the pain over the spur that is the problem.  I had mine done more than 20 years ago. I can't remember which foot it was or see the incision.  The recovery time was very short. I haven't had any problems with it since.  All the exercise and inserts may work but they're expensive and time consuming only to have it come back.  You may find a podiatrist willing to do this procedure as well. You don't have to suffer any more.  In the future make sure you wear good fitting shoes.	2015-08-06

First off, these are REALLY REALLY CUTE, which is why everything wrong with them is SUCH A bummer.<br /><br />They run really small and they are honestly way too narrow to be health for a growing toddlers feet.

Also, I found the scent really unappealing, kind of like a bathroom air freshener (yuck!)<br /><br />Take away the scent and make a roomier toe box and they would be perfect but those two things are real deal killers.	2015-08-06

It is large enough to fit all the items I needed when shopping. I received many compliments and since it has several colors in the pattern it goes very well with many of the plain colored dresses that I have. There are several pockets both inside and out to fit cell phone, lipstick etc and a pocket on the outside too so you can put your reader there. It is a great purse for commuting too. Because it is fabric you can fit alot into it but probably not your lunch ;) Well made. I used it most of the spring and almost all summer and it has not shown wear. I don't leave it on the floor and I am careful not to get it dirty. Really good bag for travel. [[ASIN:B007Q43HX0 Vera Bradley Bowler in Va Va Bloom]]	2015-08-06

I was so upset because they fit perfect.  I ordered a 7-1/2 narrow because the toe was more on the pointed side.  So I immediately ordered the same size in silver and I got the last pair Amazon had.  The color is more of a blush/gold/silver.  The color advertised was oatmeal/gold/silver.  So if you need more of a beige color then don't order this color.	2015-08-06

I highly recommend the game itself, but you should probably buy it somewhere else so you can see if the case is in good condition.	2015-08-06

The game will not install, let alone run.  And there is nothing to patch because nothing was installed.  This may be for the English language installation only, and may pertain only to the current (August, 2015) batch of DVDs being shipped.<br /><br />Straight into the trash.<br /><br />Even if you get a good DVD with complete installation on the DVD, note that Anno 1404 will install the Tages DRM system onto your computer!  Tages is an invasive DRM system that has received hundreds of thousands of user complaints.  Therefore, the v1.1 patch of the game removes the reliance on Tages (which never worked correctly), but leaves Tages installed on your computer, doing bad things.<br /><br />Basically, you should avoid Anno 1404 at all costs, even if you have a pure game machine you don't mind getting trashed.<br /><br />My recommendation is to go backwards to the original game, Anno 1602 (&#34;1602 AD&#34; in the U.S.).	2015-08-06

I have a few games I wish that I had not wasted money on, but when all you have is over rated reviews from E3 to go by, you can end up with garbage. The game is about the same as fighting WWII with a bee bee gun (how long would you live, about 10 seconds, weapons are worthless, just got killed, 5rds. from sniper rifle (3 through the head, about like a fly pestering the it), another 60rds. with no effect. Except I got killed and the rest of the time I spend running from , instead of fighting. To some it up , if you like being killed repeatedly and extremely irritated by a game designed to cheat against you (they can throw a a bottle of gas at you from 200yds. and hit you better than an expert sniper or they can be running and firing from the hip, hitting you with every shot from 200yds.), then you will like this. Game play is stupid and idiotic, like I said it kooks good. I almost forgot, the guy in a rock or blue tank kills you but you can't kill him, and there is not much stealth in the game (they can shoot you through anything, you can't hide, so you have to run from them or die). Played all the way through 30 to 40 times in the last 6 mos. Star rating for looks 4, for game play 0 to1 star.	2015-08-06

The P12's are okay. But they get really uncomfortable after wearing them for a while, and the cushion on the top is small and starts to hurt within 30 minutes or so, could just be me. The sound isn't even that great, anyone up here who says it has great sound obviously doesn't know what good sound is in a headset. You don't get your money's worth from it. It feels cheap compared to most $60 headsets. Amazon sells it for how much its really worth. But I honestly recommend buying the Turtle Beach Ear Force X12 for the XBOX 360 and rigging it up to work for the PS4. Its way more comfortable and sounds so much better than the P12's. And with the X12's, you get what you pay for, which is a really good headset.	2015-08-06

The first My Fitness was not good. But, I adore the concept and hoped they learned from mistakes and worked out bugs with version 2.  The first scheduled me for 5 days a week, after a yr I googled and found out you can't advance in the game without working out at least 8 days in a row.  Then why set me up for 5 days a week and make me feel a failure?  This 2nd edition really is worse.  First you weigh yourself. The game said my weight was 110.  That would be nice but I'm 140.  There was no option to change it to my correct weight..  The first exercise was jumping jacks.  I followed but at the end the prompt said I only did 4 but I'd done all..  That is where I took the game out and threw it away.  I typically donate to charity but I could not put another human though this torture on purpose.  Trying to exercise in itself is hard enough without a glitchy game like this holding you back.	2015-08-06

Just to give you guys a background, I have played the first fire emblem(logged over 200 hours), Sacred stones, Shadow dragon, and now this one. I love love love fire emblem ever since the first game, moreover, I love the idea of nomads coming together to fight a bigger cause.<br /><br />There were many mechanics that differ from the old ones like marriages, skills, dual battles, defensive maps and no arenas. With these new mechanics, this game is still splendid. The graphics and the art were gorgeous. The gameplay is like the other fire emblem but there is no &#34;rescue&#34;. You can pair with other players to battle together. Skills is probably the best and the worst part of this game. It takes FOREVER to grind the skills you want, but on the bright side, your character becomes unstoppable (Galeforce, Limit breaker, vantage/venegance.) I love the fact that there is no arena because frankly, the arena idea just sucks. My only major complaint is that there were NO defensive maps in this game. Maybe only one defensive map. In all the of the previous fire emblems, defensive maps were just as difficult as the offensive ones. It changes the tactics and how to use your troops.<br /><br />All in all, it was a great game and it's worth the purchase.	2015-08-06

It truly sputters any spark of immediate feel-good action or originality.  What do I mean?  Let's take a simple idea about going from point A to point B, kind of like Grand Theft Auto where you have to traverse halfway around the map and back just to accomplish nothing important. And while you're going from point A to B, you also need to go to point C, D and E because there are side missions that are somehow important too. Now let's add parkour, cause hey, it's cool and hip. Mirror's Edge it is. But it's not a simple button press to accomplish this parkour. You must be specifically looking at what you need to jump to in order to actually make any successful jump. Now we need bad guys in the story cause if everyone was good, the game would REALLY suck. Far Cry it is, because it resembles an open world while actually being very linear. Ok. But we need a hook. Something to make it seem not so copycatish to all the other games. I got it!  ZOMBIES! Dead Island it is! Because hitting zombies over the head with a super-duper modulated rusty pipe is much more enjoyable than laying waste to hundreds of them with a full-auto 50 cal. or BFG. So we have a Dead Island, Mirror's Edge, Far Cry, GTA remix. Great, right?? Not if you played those games before. Mixing it all together turns it into a much too complex layering of things to do and stuff to manage while simply going from point A to point B becomes a migraine within a headache within a hemorrhoid ready to burst.<br /><br />If you don't feel frustrated playing this game, you are special. And by being special, you will always get to ride on the short bus--from point A to point B, to C, D and F.	2015-08-06

With Destiny, Bungie has not, and even after nearly a year, there is still a menagerie (errors are named after animals in Destiny) of error codes and disconnects from Live that I and many others face. It makes it hard to review a product that stops you from using it every few minutes. Not everyone has this issue (there seems to be an ISP routing issue depending on your geographical location), but its still widespread, and nothing appears to be happening to fix it. This is not a problem I experience on ANY other game. See the Bungie forums on errors and networking.  This is too bad, because the core gunplay of the single and cooperative modes of the game are really quite good. Enemy and weapon/skill variety is satisfying and finding or earning upgrades to your gear and character is nice.  ...For a time.  The base game content can be cleared in a handful of hours. There are very few locations and after reaching level 20 you must complete daily and weekly challenges (the same missions you've already done, but with enemies that hit harder and go down more slowly) or play PVP, which has a few modes, but is uninteresting and isn't a great way to progress because the other players will have superior gear. Rewards are not based on performance, however, so you may have someone on your team who stays at the spawn point during the entire run receive the best reward after the mission while those who carry the team get nothing. Same is true of PVP. Eventually you'll have to buy the DLC to progress, which grants some additional new content, but is quite pricy, and with a new Taken King version of the game incoming, buying the base game, if you're interested in it, is a bad investment, considering the amount of content you'll be locked out of and the likelihood of your equipment being outdated when the expansion hits.  Music is nice. Graphics are good. Even though there seems to be some intricate lore behind the game, it's BEHIND the game; the acting and story are minimal and generally bad to mediocre.  Because this game has significant connection issues, fails to reward players for performance, gates progression with expensive DLC, and becomes a repetitive grind after a few hours, I can't recommend it, despite the fun and polished gameplay.	2015-08-06

Having finished the game on PS3 when it first came up. I bought this game mainly for the DLCS and improved graphics but after playing it for a couple hours  I can now tell that the game feels very different to the original one. Some areas hold more enemies or different enemies and in different locations new challenges. But we comers be warned this game is more multiplying oriented than the original dark souls 2 and dark souls 1! If you are like me and like to finished the game offline before invading or doing jolly co-operation you will have a bit of a hard time.

It was fun, had better graphics than the PS2 version, and was an enjoyable 20 minutes. Remember what I said. One thing I really liked was the ability to use free aim on any of the guns, which made gunfights easier. After I was done playing for a while, I quit the game and did other things I normally do on my computer. I then decided to play this again. Only this time, the game won't load. When I click the icon, the hourglass, which would normally signify a program is loading on Windows, pops up for only 2 seconds and them disappears. I tried spamming the icon and the game still won't load. I tried it all; logging off and back on, shutting down, restarting and the game still would not work. This made me very angry. GTA 3 on PC, a game I had been hyping for months, and it doesn't work. Rockstar, you wouldn't have these issues if GTA 3 for PC was just a straight port of the PS2 version with improved graphics and controls. The error said something about gta3.exe, but that wasn't a problem at all. I do not know what is wrong with this game on PC. Hopefully Vice City's PC port (even though the PS2 version hasn't been released yet) will fix these issues. Shameless, Rockstar :(	2015-08-06

This is one of the best games in the entire Pokemon series, if not one of the best handheld games ever made!! I bought this used back in around 2004, and last year I noticed that my game reset every time I started it up. It briefly upset me, but some quick internet research led me to see that the internal battery is a simple coin battery that can be replaced at home! I bought a replacement battery at target and found a specialty screwdriver online to open up the cartridge. In 10 minutes I had the game up and running like new. So, please don't toss the game in the trash if it isn't holding a save!!<br /><br />As for the game play, you essentially get two games in one. After exploring and earning the 8 Johto badges, you get to go do the same in Kanto, with the map looking almost identical to Red and Blue. There are a ton of great new features, and the fun factor is through the roof, even for an old game. This generation took the already popular Pokemon franchise and skyrocketed it to Nintendo's best alongside Mario and Zelda.	2015-08-06

I'm sure the game is good enough, but I bought this to play (while traveling) on my Surface Pro 3, thinking I'd install it from a USB DVD drive, and then play it from the full install.<br />Sadly, this uses a &#34;copy protection&#34; that requires the DVD always be present, hence the game is unplayable on my target device. Found this out when I took out my Surface Pro to reduce boredom on a long flight.<br />It's now installed on my laptop instead, and I play it very rarely.<br />There are downloadable hacks to surmount the copy protection, but I hate to install what could be malware just so I can play a game.<br />Seriously, I thought the game industry decided this sort of copy protection was stupid a couple of decades ago.	2015-08-06

The inside is very soft so I don't have to worry about scratching up my PS4 when I put it in or take it out. It also has nice thick padding for both the system and the contents in the front pouch yet it still is a slim case. I still wouldn't recommend dropping it (but I wouldn't in any case) but I wouldn't be as worried about it if I did. My only gripe on this case is I really wish the front pouch had more room in it. I can fit one controller, the power/video cables and one (maybe two) game/s and that's about it. I probably could fit a second controller if I neatly wrapped up the cords but I wouldn't be able to comforatbly fit any games inside of it.	2015-08-06

The gray & black console, with the most noticeable black part being a batman figure giving off an illusion of a waving cape & across reading &#34;Batman Arkham Knight&#34;, and of course the Playstation logo down to the right fitting in nicely. Being a huge comic book fan in general, but being even a bigger Batman fan than that, I am extremely satisfied with the look of this console.<br />  I am not here to comment on the sytem itself, (although the 3D blurry compatibility is nice) as I myself prefer the competing system instead, as this one falls short on certain areas. But if I was ever going to purchase the Ps4, now would be that time.	2015-08-06

I am qualifying this to say that my headphones broke in half and are now held together only by the cushion. I am giving this a temporary 1-star rating, as I followed my own advice in light of other people having this problem, and treated the headphones with care. Also, time has taught me that the mesh covering the speakers can become rather uncomfortable during a long gaming session and leaves imprints on my ears. This might indicate that they are too tight on my head.  Has great sound for the price.  Granted the base is not as strong as some of the $150+ headphones, but I can hear footsteps and other subtle clues quite well.  [It is not as sturdy as some of the (much) more expensive headphones, but for $25, I did not expect it to be.  If you don't rip it off your head it should last].  Make sure that you rotate the mic down until it clicks, or else it will remain muted (this is an excellent feature in my opinion).  Also, the individual chat/game sound adjustment on the inline volume control is key and adds exactly what I wanted to COD Advanced warfare, as unlike some previous COD games, it does not have an option to mute all players by default.  I no longer need to individually mute all the players in a lobby.  This is really handy as you will know if you play the game.  EDIT: I compared these to a lot of other much more expensive headsets and found that these are the best for hearing footsteps and other similar audio cues. I did not bother with the warranty return/exchange process and ultimately bought a second pair. Though I was quite gentle with them, they broke anyway after a few months' use. I am really at a loss as to what rating is appropriate. I have considered just buying a third pair, as warranty repair/replace is a big hassle, but at the same time, they do not perform their function as headsets for very long, and cannot receive more than 1 star.   Add some reinforcement to the band for durability and flexibility and these would score 5 stars every singletime.	2015-08-06

With a unique style and combat system, this is the definition of simple adventure. While some of the later puzzles get into the realm of merciless and hazy hardcore adventure game antics of the 90's (i.e. mix the cheez whiz and the spatula to make the nuclear detonator, obviously!), its overall straightforward and can be figured out with only 2-3 attempts.<br /><br />What makes it worth it is the story, and I can't seem to figure out how to not spoil the plot except to say its about a lovable idiot whom stumbles into a mystery and psychic powers.

It's not your usual Persona game, hence being a spinoff, but for a 3DS game, it is ADDICTING and fun. It's full of great music, eye-candy visuals and colors, funny and wonderous story that connects two of our favorite Persona groups together, and a great dungeon crawling + combat system. The feature of having to draw your own maps as well adds to the challenge, making it more fun and FOEs challenge your navigation strategy skills. Recommended for any JRPG/Dungeon Crawler/and/or Persona fan who has a 3DS.<br /><br />The side items you get in this ridiculously cheap set are great! The 3DS LL case is hard, and comforting with a soft interior and awesome design, the classic tarot cards are a must for Persona collectors, and the Artbook and CD are great for any collection and are enjoyable.

I bought this headset over a year ago and so glad I did!<br />At first I was intimidated of all the reviews of people who said that the plastic part that holds the earcups, do crack in less than a year...<br />But I decided to give them a try anyway cause everyone said the sound quality was great and their only flaw was durability.<br />And I can tell you that if you treat them with delicacy and open them from the arc (NOT from the earcups as everybody does) every time you put them on and take them off, they're going to last years and years.<br />I don't know for gaming, but for music and movies the sound is just amazing!<br />I'd give them 5/5 on sound quality. It's hard to believe that this headset (wich was made especially for gaming) can deliver better sound and bass than a lot of the other headphones out there that were made for music, but fortunately it's true.<br />About comfort I'd give them 4/5 stars. They're a bit heavy and the arc gets hitted over time, but the ear cushions are big and comfy and won't hurt your ears at all, even if you use them for hours.<br />On durability, you MUST treat them with delicacy. Is not like they're made of birthday cake but if you treat them like any other headphones they will probably end up cracking in less than a year.<br />Portability 1/5. They're too big, too delicate, you can't fold them, just forget it... This were made to stay IN home.<br />And about the bass impact (wich was made especially for gaming), I rarely use it but when I do I use less than 10% for movies or I'll get too punchy and screw the sound. But there's really no need for it. It's like the type of thing you're almost better without it when it comes to movies and music...<br />So yeah there's my review. Even with all it's flaws, this headset it's worthy of every penny.<br />At this price range, this is just the best option for music and movies.	2015-08-06

Especially since it's from the same creators of one of my favorite PS4 games Bloodborne. Unfortunately, this games is much slower and clunky. There's virtually no story elements or any memorable characters for that matter. I got bored two hours in and simply forced myself to beat this game just for the bragging rights. On a side note, Dark Souls isn't that hard (in terms of skill), it's very cheap. I mean this game often put me in circumstances where I was fighting multiple bosses or bosses and enemies at the same time. Yeah ... Now that I think about it, cheap is the only word I can use to best capture my feelings towards this game. Anywho, instead of relying on skill to beat Dark Souls (where as in Bloodborne player skill is essential),  just spam ranged attacks with a mage or archer to easily overcome most of the game. Keep in mind Dark Souls is a much slower game riddled with bugs and ever present glitches. It's a whole different experience than Bloodborne and not a memorable one at that.	2015-08-06

I purchased the X-Box One Master Chief collection about a week ago. It was so exciting to open the X-Box One and to hook it up to the TV. That was the end of the excitement for awhile and the beginning of the horror. 1st - &#34;Must&#34; connect to the Internet for the initial installation of the system. No problem right! Wrong! Unable to connect to the Internet at my house. I live in the country and have satellite wifi. I had to take the Xbox One 30 miles away to my brother's house to do the setup. After connecting to DSL the Initial setup went well. 2nd- &#34;Attempted&#34; to download the Master Chief collection. Two days later still not downloaded. What happened? Apparently after one hour of non use during the download of the Master Chief collection, the Xbox One shut down. If the unit shuts off... No download is happening. That was the first day. Second day was spent trying to find out why the Xbox One shut down every hour. Turns out that there's a setting that shuts the unit off after one hour. You can change that setting to 6 hours or never. On the third day the download was completed. Total time to download was 13 hours not including the time wasted when the X-Box One was off. So I signed into X-Box live (required when you first play Halo and finally I could play for a few minutes. After boxing up the X-Box One I went home from my brothers house. 3rd- &#34;Must&#34; sign into the Xbox live. Again!!! It turns out that you must sign into X-Box live before playing the downloaded Halo game...unless you change the setting (while on x-box live) to offline. Who would have thought? So guess what....back to square one. So after getting The X-box online again (guess how) I switched the settings to offline. And finally me and my boys could play halo. So we thought. For some reason it didn't work. Once we signed out of X-Box live it happened again. We eventually figured it out and the &#34;offline&#34; setting took and we played Halo for hours. Excitement returned! I really love Halo! It is awesome! Almost got the sour taste out of my mouth from all those trips back and forth from my brothers house. 4th- final straw. My boys and I rented a DVD and went home to watch it on the XBox One. Yay! Not!!! After we put the disc in, it said that we Must, and I say again MUST, connect to XBox live to ..... Download an app....so we can ....watch a movie on the X-Box One. I write it that way because I...we were in disbelief. So that is where we stand now. Able to play Halo but not watch movies on the X-box One. The X-box One is an internet based system that also allows gaming. The X box One is for Internet connecting first and gaming second. If you look at the X-Box One in that light (Internet first) then I would have given it 5 stars. Instead I thought the X-box One was Gaming first with connectivity to the Internet. My mistake.  We brought a PS4 and we connected to the internet once. We even got to watch that movie on the PS4. Final analysis- X-box One and the PS 4 are totally different systems. The PS4 is for gaming first with Internet if you want. and the X-box One is for internet first with gaming second. Would I recommend someone buying the X-box One? Surprisingly, yes. But, only if they understand that the X-Box One was built around internet first gaming second. I guess that's why Microsoft went with X-box One (one system for everything) instead of X-Box 720. Maybe I'll come back and change my rating in the future. After the memories of the Internet requirements, long drives to get internet, down load times and the lack of a pre-installed app for DVD playing fades.............till then it's Halo time.  *this is an update to my original review* After having the X-box One for awhile I felt that I had to come back and update my review. Originally I gave this game system 1 star. But, now after using it for awhile I admit it's a great system. I just need better internet to be able to enjoy more of the features.	2015-08-06

I like exploring the mountains for resources.  The areas you go have resources of course, but they're all very developed.  Over all it's a great game though and I'd recommend it if you loved the old Harvest Moon games.<br /><br />(I've put 60 hours into a single save file at the time of writing this)	2015-08-06

Etrian Odyessey is a dungeon crawler game but one the best aspects about it is you get to draw your own map. You paint the layouts of the floors and walls as you go along. You have special symbols to place on the map like a treasure chest symbol that changes it's appearance (when you mark a treasure chest then open it the symbol shows an open box). You can place annotations on the map marking special locations or just to make your own personal comment so you have a lot of free will in this game. You have two modes in this game a story and classic mode, the story mode is preset with already made characters and plot to go through while classic allows you to be the creator and make your own team and adventure. If you have played Persona Q then you will recognize the map system from the start. The game has several difficulty levels you can choose from, allowing you to either easily play through and enjoy the story or spend many hours grinding to get your level up so you can proceed.. so whether you enjoy playing through easily and enjoying the story or proving your skill at grinding and putting the beatdown on your enemies you won't be disappointed. If you are new to the series it won't leave you in the dark either, you can enjoy this game without having played any of the other games. The graphics and sound are impressive and the controls are simple enough so I won't go into detail on those. I basically like to leave my reviews at what I like about a game and my personal opinion on them. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's new to RPGs or who wants to give a dungeon crawler a shot. Happy Gaming to all my fellow Gamers.	2015-08-06

I'm not big on doing reviews but since I have played this game I felt the need too. I'm usually all about online gaming and refuse to play story modes but after seeing the previews of this game I kinda wanted to play it. So I did and it was worth every penny I spent on it. I forgot all about destiny and COD! I haven't played the previous witcher games so this was my first go at it. This game is amazing,the open world story mode and side quests will keep you busy! I followed the main story and finished the main story around level 30 not meaning too so I realized there was so much I didn't explore by following the main story line and barely doing the side quests. So if you do buy this game make sure to do all of the side quests, treasure hunts and undiscovered location as well as the main story. I would advice to do them as there is so much more to it (because i started it over again and I'm romancing triss this time) also the fact that your decision changes the outcome is awesome in this game. I saved 2 characters in my first game and starting my 2nd game I choose different and ended having a completely different outcome!!! My only beef is the long loading time, roach the horse can pop up in the most awkward places and the lighting candles and torches around stuff makes you wana pull your hair out, I mean you could be running for your life and he wants to stop and light a candle because pressing the run button also lights fires!! So I haven't been doing any online gaming since I bought this game. This is one of my favorite games even though I rarely play RPG games.	2015-08-06

If you like action game with Gore and Greek history this is your game.<br />It comes with God of War 1 and 2 and cost $19.99 is Great deal if you never play this game.<br /><br />Play style- Like Devil May Cry, Oni musha with Hard core Gore with Adult content added.<br />Third person action you play as Kratos and two button to attack( Light and Heavy attack)  Jump, Guard, and special attack. New function with Vita is that it has touch censer in the back so it will make you touch it when you open treasure box,to talk to person or light object you see in the screen. This might be frustrating to do since some times it recognize even you were not mentioning to do by holding the touch censer part, but once you get the game play it doesn't disturbed you since you will be into the story and action which is lot of fun.<br />Play time- I beat it in 7 hours for God of War and  9 hours of God of War 2  I like to full up all the weapon and health as possible before the last boss so I took lot of time in the game. If you try just beating the game, maybe you can beat the game much faster.<br />Game graphic and sound- Graphic is not great and old graphic looking compare to modern game since it was made doing PS 2 era but It is in HD remaster and I did not feel really old with the graphic. Sound is very clear and nice with the Movie Mummy like music.<br /><br />Over All- If you haven't play this game and you are looking for action game, you must have this game. I wish they will release God of War 3 and Ascension for PS Vita to complete the God of War series.	2015-08-06

Has lots of great songs for her to dance to, including old favorites like &#34;Right Round (original version&#34; and the &#34;Macarena,&#34; as well as more recent hits. She likes the new interface too, compared to Just Dance 2 (she hasn't used any of the years in between, so not sure how many of the changes are new to this game or if they have been incorporated in others, but in any case, she likes it). The online capabilities of the game are cool and being able to dance with other people from around the world is a great feature as well (since she doesn't bug me to do it with her anymore, haha). The Amazon price couldn't be beat either!<br /><br />According to her, it is also a good way to get a little exercise and work up a sweat in a fun way, especially in the winter months when you don't want to go outside. She always does crunches or jumping jacks or something in between songs while the game is loading so she can keep her heart rate up.	2015-08-06

Great item and looks just like that picture. I was worried about if it would fit my console, seeing as how I own a PS Vita Slim. However, once I slipped my PS Vita slim into the pouch, I no longer had to worry. It fit like a dream. There was no bulging, no resistance in zipping it up, and just no problem at all. The best part about it is the fact that is has this awesome deep front pocket and the pocket zips closed so your items wont fall out. I use the pocket to store my games that I carry with me so I can change them out whenever I feel like playing a different one. The pocket is also deep enough to fit a pair of ear buds to plus into your console. The quality of the item is great, high quality zippers, and great rich color. If I had four hands, I would give this item 4 thumbs up!! Unfortunately, I don't have for hands. So I give the product 2 HUGE THUMPS UP!!!	2015-08-06

Ready to use right out of the box since it is paired at the factory.  No need to be pushing buttons and dealing with pairing it to your game console.  Just plug in the USB transmitter into our XBox One, turn on your PDF AfterGlow Headset and you are ready to go.<br /><br />Has a wireless frequency of 2.4GHz.  Claims to have a range of 40 feet but I attempted to go from my bedroom to the kitchen which is about 15 feet and the chat was choppy and came in and out.  However, the battery life of 16 hours is true.  I am able to get anywhere from 15-16 hours of battery life from one charge.  To get longer life of your battery, turn off the headset glow feature on the headphones, this will conserve some battery power.  I however love the glow!  They take about 3 hours to fully charge back to life.<br /><br />In regards to ear fatigue, they are adjustable but might be a little snug if you have a larger than average sized head.  The padding on the top of the headset and over the ear cups are very well cushioned.  After a couple of hours of play my ears were not uncomfortable or itchy.<br /><br />More and more headsets are going towards this type of microphone - flexible and retractable types.  This one is a longer than ones I have tried before but it seems this type always have problems.  I got complaints that I was not able to be heard some of the time.  It is more like cellphone quality conversation where you hear from one ear.  I sounded muffled and unclear.  However, it could also be my internet connection.<br /><br />The power and mute is controlled by a large button on the cup.  There are two modes that are controlled by mode button located on the headset.  It controls basic audio and bass-boost modes,  There are light indicators at the end of the mic to let you know what mode you are in.<br /><br />In regards to game audio, this is where does the best.  I don't place the volume on high where my ears will be ringing after playing games.  I prefer a comfortable level where I can clearly hear the game and feel like I am inside the game action but still be aware of my surroundings.  The AG7 does just that with crisp sounds and deep tones.<br /><br />Besides the cool looks and great game audio, I love how I don't have to use that PITA XBox One headset game adapter on my controller.  Using that thing drove me nuts because I kept bending the cable since I would set the controller on my stomach while playing.  And I don't even want to go into trying to control the audio with that adapter.<br /><br /> Even though it is wireless, it can be used with MP3 players or mobile devices using the audio-in jack cable.prefer a comfortable level where I can clearly hear the game and feel like I am inside the game action but still be aware of my surroundings.

Which is sad because the game is set in 2004 the greatest era of all time. Theres nothing like playing randy legend killer not the viper, or cena dr.of thuganomics not cenation. It is the end of the attitude era and man is it fun to see clasics like nidia or 3D.

I was a diehard COD4 fan and less so Modern Warfare 2. From then on, I lost interest in the COD series. However, this is akin back to the COD4 days but with a lot more to it. The game is incredibly well-balanced between the titans and the pilots and there's never a shortage of things to do in the multiplayer. I did NOT expect to like this game as much as I did and I'm glad I got it on sale for 15 bucks because it's proving to be one of the most worthwhile gaming purchases I've ever made. I cannot wait for Titanfall 2 and I will now be preordering it the first chance I get!	2015-08-06

I can't think of another game where you work for a PMC and the find out they're the bad guys all along (Army of Two, HAWX off the top of my head).<br />The multiplayer has no community management, Sledgehammer refuses to update the PS3 version of this game. The maps are too small for the exo abilities. The weapons in multiplayer are incredibly unbalanced, and it doesn't help that the hit detection is broken.<br /><br />I would only recommend this if you can find it used or on sale. I'm so happy I didn't pay the full price for this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Kevin Spacey<br />Somewhat entertaining story<br /><br />Cons:<br />Amateur developer<br />Unbalanced and broken multiplayer<br />Multiplayer lobbys filled with hackers<br />No community management from developer or publisher<br />No support from developer or publisher<br />Several severe bugs in single player and multiplayer, to the point of hard reboot	2015-08-06

Video Games	3	0	0	N	Y	An acceptable budget option.	I have one of the early model Wii's with very high audio output levels. With this converter I got serious audio distortion over the HDMI signal whenever I started the Wii menu or any time there were loud sounds in a game. The picture quality was good and I couldn't feel any lag from the upscaling, however I did have trouble getting a signal on an older Sony Wega 720p CRT.<br /><br />I've now replaced this with the Sewell Wii to HDMI Converter. It solved my audio level issue and outputs the original 480p signal with no upscaling/lag at all.	2015-08-06

It follows Season 1 of Winx Club although it has some slight changes, and has all the voices used for the 4Kids version (which was soooooo much better than when Nick took over).  Although we had some issues with older computers (I think pre XP? I can't remember...) We have used it on Windows 7 and Windows 8 without issue.  Fun for younger kids around 8-ish I would guess, and probably older kids too if they enjoyed the Season 1 storyline.  Might be too easy for preteens otherwise.  But I will admit to sitting down to play and enjoying myself.  :)	2015-08-06

XCom Declassified is a third person, cover- based shooter. You do have squadmates what you issue orders to. The combat is played in real-time (unlike previous XComs which were turn-based strategy games). There is a radial wheel which lets you choose different dialog choices when speaking to Npcs; in certain segments of the game.<br /><br />The dialog wheel and character level up system lend it  an RPG aspect similar to ME, though here in XCom, it rather limited. And that limitation is by the very fact that the dialog choices doesn't affect the storyline or the character interactions.<br /><br />Though I won't go into the generic story about aliens attacking earth. You are sent into different parts of the USA  to destroy, retrieve or explore alien infested areas. Before doing so however, you can select sqaudmates and outfit them with weapons and equipement. There are different classes of squadmates which have their own weapon specialization and abilities.<br /><br />The requisitory sniper, shotgunner, smgs etc are there and each class has an abilty unique to them. Some have to abilty to cloak, lay down automated laser turrets, land mines, abililties to distract l, levitate alien enemies are also there (as are self healing and critical hits.)<br /><br />The ME influnces and gameplay mechanics are prevalent, but their exectutions are poorly implemented in XCom. During the cover and shoot actions  your character feels a bit unresponsive and sometimes require that you try to get cover behind walls or objects multiple times. The same thing occurs when rolling on ground to reach a cover point or dodge-roll.<br /><br />When you face off aliens in combat you can slow down time to issue specific orders to squadmates and to activate their individual special abilities (which are limited to a brief cooling period before being able to activate them again).<br /><br />Your A.I. squadmates can engage enemies of there own voilition, but the biggest problem is that they are incredibly stupid. They will run into your line of fire, run out into the open to get perforated  by enemy fire. If your squadmates get wounded you have a limited amount of time to heal them before they die. Their death is permanent and well deserved because their stupidity is a severe impedance and takes away all enjoyment of this game.<br /><br />Without any multiplayer or co-op feature, the novelty and replay value of XCom declassified is near zero and can barely justify a purchase even from the bargain bin.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+cover shoot mechanics similar to Mass Effect<br />+special abilities<br /><br />Cons:<br />-incredibly stupid A.I.<br />-unresponsive controls<br />-boring story<br />-linear missions<br />-linear dialog which makes no difference to the story<br />-boring wave after wave of enemies<br />-aliens are over-powered for a big portion of the game<br />-not worth more than $5.00 dollars	2015-08-06

It's total hours of strategic fun whether with the AI or multiplayer. Sometimes I like to mess with the AI player and keep defending a mini base with like 50 tanks and missiles. However, there's one pet peeve I've had with this game and that's when the AI begins doing more damage to you and your troops than you can do. How the hell do my heavy tanks take 2 shots to kill 1 soldier (one beefy soldier) while the AI's tank does it in 1 shot, and the damage done to my jet is also increased, especially by enemy missiles. Always found that unfair but I manage to still win.	2015-08-06

Here are a few things i noticed:  1. Ammo is much less available, making some guns useless. 2. shield weakpoints are nonexistent and after shield is down, everyone (you or enemy) goes down easy, no matter where the target is hit. 3. movement is not as responsive as other halo games.  In my perspective if you're looking for the same feel that you have gotten from other halo games, you wont find it here. Its clear that it's not Bungie anymore and that 343 decided to drop in their brew into this game.  If you're looking to follow the story, as far as i played its decent and is the only thing that kept me playing through the horrible gameplay.	2015-08-06

Skyrim is the ultimte RPG/Fantasy and is filled with multiple quests and storylines roughout the entire game and not just the main camapign questline.  Skyrim can be extremely addicting at times.  For example when I had spent about three hours on a quest, two new ones popped right up for me to do.  All in all I give this game a 5/5 star review.  The graphics in this game are top notch for 2012 standards.  Skyrim may have a bit of outdated graphics but it makes up for it in the amazing gameplay and overall feel of the game.  Even if you're not into RPG or Fantasy type games, you will definitly enjoy Skyrim.  All in all this game easily deserves well more than 5 stars, but the maximum rating that I can give it is only 5 stars :)<br />In conclusion, this is a great RPG/Fantasy game and just a great game in general and I think that it is easily (along with Destiny) the best Xbox 360 game ever!	2015-08-06

I bought this steering wheel while in France (Thrustmaster is a French company, previously called Guillemot and specialized in making joysticks) back in December 2012. I have been using it ever since. It is a wonderful piece of hardware. I previously owned a Logitech G27 and before that the Microsoft side winder or something like that. Every time, my driving scores have improved with the upgrades.<br /><br />What's to like:<br />- Serious hardware with 3 motors and amazing quality. The pedals are made of metal alloy and extremely heavy and sturdy. The resistance of the pedals is very good and simulate those of a real car.<br />- You can set the pedals two ways, rF1 and GT depending on your preference or room available.<br />- The pedals are very heavy and will stay put when you drive, unlike other plastic ones that constantly slide on carpet.<br />- The driving sensation is very good and my driving performance increased when compared to Logitech.<br />- Excellent and strong force feedback. This thing set to the maximum FFB will get your arms sore after a while.<br />- Stay put when attached to your desk or table and placement is not as limited as the Logitech wheels.<br /><br />What I like much less:<br />- I thought I had bricked it twice while upgrading the firmware. There are some workarounds to get it back to life that are not too difficult to follow. I am by the way using it with a PC, not with a console.<br />- Price is high.<br />- No stick shift attached. You can still use the manual gears but you will have to use the pads behind the wheel. You can buy a very good one but for another 150 bucks...<br />- Fan can get loud at times.	2015-08-06

Geek chic collectors edition psp, looks good on your collection shelf with the added bonus of playing a wealth of retro games including pone classics.<br /><br />That said it isn't without its flaws, mine came with a duff battery pack that wouldn't even fit into the system. The item doesn't appear to be £200 worth of kit, has a fairly cheap plastic feel to it and is a great deal more blue colouring over the white. I personally would've preferred a slightly more white touch, however realise some may actually find the blue a more pleasing palette.<br /><br />All in all am happy with the product just begrudge the price a little.

During the last generation, it felt like Sony was largely playing catch up with the features of Xbox Live and the Xbox in general. The PS4 has eliminated the gap and shot slightly ahead in terms of raw technical specs. Virtually gone is the move controller and any integration with motion control. This console focuses on gaming and it largely succeeds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Big step up in graphics from the PS3.<br />2. Overall better specs with a 500gb hard drive to handle increasingly chunkier game updates and downloads.<br />3. The Playstation Network is finally ready for prime time. (even if it's frequently getting attacked)<br />4. New controller adds functionality through slight evolution.<br />5. Integrated movie capture mode that allows you to save the last 15 minutes of game play with the push of 2 buttons.<br />6. Integration has been added to share your accomplishments via social media like Facebook and YouTube.<br />7. Ever increasing game library.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Hard drive could be bigger.<br />2. There is no way to be online without all of your PSN friends seeing your online status.<br />3. No backward compatibility with PS3 games.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game console.	2015-08-06

These games give you a truckload of equipment, and it's up to you to figure out all the crazy tricks and secrets you can get with them. The stealth gameplay is challenging, but immensely rewarding - sneaking past a row of guards is ten times as satisfying compared to gunning them down one by one. The collection skips a few games in the series, including AC!D and Portable Ops, but they aren't important to the story so I suppose it's fine. Overall, the Metal Gear series isn't one you should miss, even if action games aren't your thing.	2015-08-06

It is so much different than '13. First of all, there is so much good about this game, but there are downsides to it. I'll start with the good. The hitting, fighting, and overall gameplay is much improved. I'm glad they ditched the first person fighting, but third person is kinda confusing at first. The hits and checks feel like I'm in my screen playing. There are other great things to the game, but I'll start going to the cons. The scoring is so strange. For example I was playing earlier and there would be this one spot I would shoot and score over half of the time. Anyways, the cpu was playing poorly and the score was 3-8 at the end of the second period. I played even harder in the third, and for however reason, they found ways around and made it 8-8 with less than ten seconds left. They lugged it forward and magically there was the opponent in front of my goal who scored with 1.2 seconds left on the clock. Does it get anymore fixed to win then that? I wanted to break the disc! I guess they were trying to give me a game, but come on. Another thing is the commentary. It sounds like a repeat of NHL 13 with a few new lines thrown in there. I don't know if it's just me, but the commentators sounded like they were bored out of their minds! They also needed to do work on the crowd! When I was playing the other day, I scored on the opponent and my home crowd sat and booed me! It seems like it's accuracy was off. When they do get &#34;excited&#34;, it sounds like they're getting add thrilled as being on a merry-go-round. But when I score, they usually go insane like there's a riot, so I get confused on what's happening every once and a while. I do think though that the graphics are also better by quite a bit compared to '13. Another weird thing I noticed that was probably an EA Sports screw-up is when I go into my settings to play as the goalie, it will say &#34;Goalie Mode On&#34; when I'm not on that mode, and &#34;Goalie Mode Off&#34; when I activate it. It was the complete opposite in NHL 13. They most likely messed up the text on it. One last thing, when I poke check or steal the puck and it's still there on the ice, the opponent usually ends up getting it back due to my guy not getting it when I'm right in front of it. Overall though, this was a great buy and a long shot better than NHL 13. Hope this helps!on that mode, and &#34;Goalie Mode Off&#34; when I activate it. It was the complete opposite in NHL 13.

It allows me to play all my favorite consoles and games in glorious hd on my tv. I love the save states, as well as the ability to patch games. I frequently buy classics from Japan that would be very pricy in their US forms, and simply apply English patches to play them. The one downside would be the controler, I think. While it functions, it is rather cheap, and very noisy. As for those who claim there is an input delay, this must be due to the TV they are playing on. I have three tvs with &#34;gaming&#34; or low lag modes, and this works flawlessly.	2015-08-06

Where to begin with this game?<br /><br />Re:coded is, by far, the weakest entry in the Kingdom Hearts series. It started as a mobile game and quite frankly, it shows. The worlds are incredibly repetitive. The level design is incredibly weak in a series with fairly mediocre level design. The story is laughable and does not really tie in to the main story at all except towards the end. There's a lot of extra content but most of it involves replaying levels and I'm not sure why anyone would want to do that.<br /><br />Assuming you have played any Kingdom Hearts game before, this game technically takes place almost right after KH2. The story begins with Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket attempting to access Jiminy's first journal by digitizing it. Of course, it turns out that the whole thing is full of bugs and thus employ DataSora (i.e. the Sora from the journal) to delete them. Thus, Sora goes from familiar world to familiar world destroying bugs. Frankly, the story is laughably thin and fails to do much more than harp on notes already introduced in previous installments even as it tries to introduce some level of interest.<br /><br />The level design, with a few exceptions, is literally just older maps with a bunch of blocks (or &#34;blox&#34;) thrown on top. The result is fairly ugly (which is the point I suppose) and also manages to suck out any of the charm that the game might possess by virtue of its Disney source material. And of course, the worlds repeat themselves frequently just to make it through the default story; and of course the game wants you to repeat them even more to get 100% which is absolutely infuriating. And who had the bright idea to, towards the end of the game, start replacing the Heartless with poorly designed Blox Spider monsters? The game does introduce one new environment in the form of system servers. Throughout the game, Sora is called upon to enter into digital holes in the datascape to fix bugs, which requires the completion of minilevels. These are also fairly frustrating in their repetition and annoying platforming sections.<br /><br />Many of the boss battles have been replaced by quasi-mini games, such as side-scrolling, shoot em ups, and turn-based RPGs. Compared to the rest of the game, these are actually pretty fun. The actual gameplay itself feels pretty good for a console, especially compared to the clunky interface and controls of Days. However, that is not enough to save this game, though it is enough for me to grant it two instead of one star.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch the cutscenes or something. It is not worth purchasing and definitely does not stand alone as a game worth playing in any capacity, even for the die-hard KH fan.	2015-08-06

This 5-in-1 cable has been a great solution.  Unfortunately, I only received the cable portion - someone had removed the adapter portion before shipment.  But since it was the cable that I needed (and time was of the essence) and I never intended on using the other part anyway, I kept the package rather than go through the return process.

The game starts you off in battle after finishing one of the very few (low budget) animated cuticles and surprise surprise everyone is amnesiac and can't remember what they were doing moments prior  after wiping out the mobs in the tutorial fight they meet the antagonist &#34;the end&#34; after explaining  the pillar (where the game mainly takes place) to the protagonists he vanishes.<br /><br />After finishing quests to level up characters and gain currency known as &#34;EN (energy)&#34; you can chat with the other characters to bond with them which besides them assisting you (no romance in this game either to my knowledge so don't bother expecting to get it in with nagi, himeno or mana) doesn't do much much else besides get the &#34;true ending&#34; (more on that later,) the main gimmick in this game is the &#34;traitor system&#34; which in a nutshell means that someone (at most 3) will betray you at the end of the game, the only thing that does though is make you fight them before the boss which isn't that tough, I myself kept himeno up till the end of the game and had to fight her although It didn't even take a turn to wipe the floor with her, if you guess all 3 or 4 times correctly during judgment then you won't have to fight them at all, note that figuring out who the traitors are does take a bit of logic to figure out.<br /><br />Essentially the game repeats from there, you bond with characters, figure out who the traitor is and kill them, progress through levels and upgrade equipment till you reach the top of the tower where you fight the final boss and congrats you beat the game, or maybe not!<br /><br />If youdidn't bond with everyone then you get the &#34;normal ending&#34; where you defeat the end but are left at a cliff hanger.<br /><br />Now I could play through the whole game again (new game plus, started at the beginning at lvl 6 instead of lvl,  that's all I saw before I stopped posting) and get a better grasp of the story but honestly I couldn't care less to do so and won't put forth the effort because in the end I just don't care, in the beginning I was enjoying the game and didn't even have high expectations but those started falling near the end of the game, honestly valkyria chronicles is far better than this vita port clone (that has a stuttering and crashing problem) so you should save your money and buy VC for only $18 to get the physical version, you'll be in for a much better time.<br /><br />For anyone wondering there is no multiplayer in this game and you should really get this game on vita I can't say with 100% guarantee but I'm pretty sure the only difference between the PS3 and PSV versions is the resolution, this game Is simply far more suited to a handheld over a console.<br /><br />Tl;dr buy Valkyria Chronicles instead of this over priced lower quality clone. (about $18)	2015-08-06

I have mixed feelings about this product and company, but for a $7 wireless mouse, I really can't complain.

All it does is direct you to their website in a few different languages. Their website wouldn't load on Chrome, but I was able to bring it up on Safari.<br /><br />When I first opened the box, I was impressed with the materials the mouse was made with. It's not as great as the Apple &#34;Magic&#34; mouse I use at work, but the price difference reflects this. Performance wise though, this mouse is better. Very responsive and the mouse fits in my hand nicely. I love that the scrolling speed can be changed with the simple push of a button.<br /><br />I had a little trouble getting the battery to fit correctly at first. I had it orientated correctly, so the lights on the mouse lit up, but the battery needed to be *clicked* in to make the mouse track movements. Not sure if this is the case for everyone, but it is something to keep an eye on as had I not bumped the battery when I was trying to take it out I would have tried to return it. Now it works flawlessly, no complaints.	2015-08-06

So we returned it, ordered a new one, and the same exact thing happened.  After the game loads, it walks you through the steps to begin using it.  You plug the cord into your guitar which is plugged into the PS4 console.  Then the narrator tells you to strum your guitar loud until the game picks it up or recognizes it or whatever.  But the game never does recognize the guitar or do anything at all after that point.  My son strummed his guitar til his fingers were sore, and the game did nothing.  I can see one game being defective, but two?  We trouble-shot over the phone with Rocksmith, who said there was no issues with the type of guitar we were using.  They suggested trying it on someone elses PS4, but everyone near us uses a different gaming console.  Frustrating.  Will have to get a refund and not buy again.	2015-08-06

You do not have to have the game completed to play The Tower of Time. This came in its package undamaged, all the parts work.

The game is well made, except for defense. It's such a huge mistake on EAs behalf. But it's still the best game out there now. Hopefully will be fixed in the 2016 version   After a week of playing FIFA 15, i hate it. I've moved up to 4th division in this span, but hate the defense. EA forgot to make defending more realistic. Shooting and scoring from 3/4 length and scoring is unreal. Keepers can't grab on to the ball, even on soft shots. Double teams are flawed. Manual defense is extremely cumbersome and inconsistent. In the effort to make the game more realistic, EA forgot about DEFENSE. I'm a lifelong soccer player and played college ball. So, I know soccer. The dribbling is okay, keepers are terrible. But defense was such an after thought that I can't give any good ratings to this game because defense is also part of the game. A half baked game isn't good enough.	2015-08-06

Hmmm, I think 4 stars is good but it maybe 3 would be truer?<br /><br />I REALLY liked the game, not the best game I've ever played, but it has descent story, graphics, playthrough, voice acting etc...<br />The idea of weapon switching is both annoying and clever, depending on how you look at it :)<br />I was not a huge fan of switching the character you control so many times during the game.. I feel it removes from immersion, so 2 characters would probably have been enough but it's ok I guess.<br />My issues are the length of the game, it's super short, which is too bad since it's pretty good!<br />On this, I have less issues with a game like Overkill being so short, because the shooting-at-monsters part is really fun, but in  DSE, the shooting part is not THAT fun, so it's not like I'd replay it over and over to shoot more monsters... On that topic, if all you want is a fun rail game, this is probably not it.<br /><br />And finally the ending. There is pretty much only what seems to be a trailer for the following game (DS1) and we don't get to learn anything... I know this is a prequel, but it should stand on its own, which it does pretty well till the ending. True now I want to play DS1, but it's on a different platform.. and it'll be a different genre...<br /><br />TLDR: Great game for a few hours, but don't spend too much on it thinking you'll be playing 100+ hours...	2015-08-06

I've used it for playing rad racer, top gun, and punchout and surprisingly it's fairly accurate. I will admit I was really frustrated with this at first because I didn't know you had to set the controller to a certain code for certain games and it was doing whatever it wanted. After I looked up the codes (quick google search gave me everything) and moved to a different spot in the room (I was sitting directly under a ceiling fan light and it was making it a little buggy) this thing worked like a charm. If you're looking for a cool/different retro console accessory to play with, I would give this a try.	2015-08-06

Purchased one of these at a local store as I’ve lost my SNES controllers during the past couple moves. Popped in Super Metroid for some nostalgia gaming. The controller is OK. Buttons are nice, but the controller feels very cheap. The D-pad is where this starts going downhill. It’s not very responsive and feels mushy. I’m going to look for a different controller, or see if I can’t get my hands on a used SNES controller.  If you’re in a pinch then this controller will work, but if you want a good playing experience look elsewhere.  UPDATE: Local Store actually had used original controllers. Unfortunately the one I purchased had a start button that didn't like to work. Took the dpad and other parts from the original controller and put them into the TTX Tech controller. It now feels much more like the original.	2015-08-06

Easy to install, though you do have to re-download everything (expected but a pain).  The extra space is a dream!  I'm using a 4TB hybrid drive and functions great for gameplay.  Though with such a large drive I'm not able to use the PS4's sleep mode any longer.  The system hard crashes and must run through system checks on next boot if you allow it to go to sleep.  I have to power down completely after each play.  For me it's worth the trade-off to have the extra space though I wish Sony would release a patch to address this.  It's not Nyko's fault.	2015-08-06

I've been through a couple terrible but similar keyboards and I cannot find a serious flaw with this one. Some have said the battery recharge function doesn't work, but I'm here to tell you on mine it very much does. I agree with some of the complaints that the function buttons are weirdly placed but this is something you get used to over time, and it's still faster than typing with your joystick. The weight doesn't affect my gaming, in fact I find it better than a bare controller, keeping the weight evenly distributed, instead of front heavy (something you won't even notice till you play with, and then without this for a while). The light up function is nice and, so far, the battery power is great. I've yet to have this die while playing a couple days in a row, and ended up recharging it anyways after a while because...why not? The recharge function works on my controller and has actually fully recharged the controller, while still being useable as a typing apparatus, and continued to work long after the controller was fully charged. The little ring that goes around the PS button does NOT hinder the access to that button in any way, and fits around it cleanly. If it affects anything at all, I would say it does block the speaker on the controller, but the only reason that is a problem is because sometimes I will put my thumb over the speaker, so it doesn't tell another player what I'm up to (this is mostly a problem in GTA when you're calling a mugger or Maryweather on someone and your headset microphone can hear it because it's so close to the controller speaker). With that ring around the PS button, I can't put my thumb cleanly over it, and my friends know when I'm pranking them with a mugger attack. Heh. On the plus side, however, that ring has greatly decreased the number of times my thumb has slipped off the joystick and hit the PS button in a frantic moment.<br /><br />If there is one true complaint I have, and to some this may be a big one, is that I personally like to use my Playstation Camera's microphone a lot. To either command the PS4 or talk to other players without having to wear headgear. Because of this keyboard's pass through jack that allows you to still plug in a headset, the plug on the keyboard activates the PS4's headset detection, and disengages the microphone on the camera. I have not found a work around for this and sometimes find it frustrating. If you're playing a game at all that requires the camera, you'll want to take this off (or grab another controller), or plug in a headset. The headsets work great with it, but for someone like me who doesn't like to be tethered to my controller or have something in my ear when I'm casually gaming, this can be a major flaw. I almost removed a star for this problem, since for me it's a rather big deal, but being that most players use headsets and HATE the camera speakerphone option, this isn't a complaint many of you will have. I also have NOT tried a bluetooth headset in conjunction with this, but that's because I hate bluetooth headsets due to the need to recharge them far too often. Another small complaint is that the initial charge is rather brutally lengthy, I think it said 7 hours, but this isn't so bad as long as you leave it charging overnight while the PS4 is on sleep mode, or charging it while playing all day with another controller. I also don't recommend taking this on or off frequently as it fits snug, and could break or scratch the controller with constant attaching and detaching, but being that I have several controllers already, it's easy to just leave it on one, and grab that controller if I feel I will ever need it.<br /><br />Any other flaws aside I could note above may not be worth mentioning if you really need a keyboard for your controller, because this is the ONLY one that I've found that works out of the very limited selection out there, and works great for what it's supposed to do. If you're someone that for whatever reason will absolutely need a keyboard with quick access and not a separate unit from your controller, this is possibly your only option and, like me, you'll forgive the flaws. I've been using it for a couple weeks now and besides the few nit-picks I've mentioned, I have had zero issues that seriously affect my gaming experience. Is it a necessity? No. Will you regret buying this? No. So if you have the money, pick it up, if anything as an optional accessory as it is extremely handy in games with text based puzzles or functions, most notably the GTA Online text message function, or character creator games with name inputs.ly need a keyboard with quick access and not a separate unit from your controller, this is possibly your only option and, like me, you'll forgive the flaws.

As a mom, I'm thankful that it can close to prevent it from breaking or cracking the screen if it falls or gets dropped. She doesn't like using the 3D feature too often as it hurts her eyes, but it is easily turned off which is great. It's set up well so she is able to navigate it easily. The battery lasts a long time and it charges quickly which is a bonus. The stylus was a little loose and could fall out easily, but I just wrapped a piece of scotch tape around the end and that solved the problem! So glad she got it!	2015-08-06

Don't be fooled by the off brand name and the low price. This is a hidden gem in headsets. The quality of the headset is right up there with some of the most durable headsets I have seen. Flexible headband, twist able ear pieces, beautiful leds on each ear, removable/adjustable mic, and quality made cable, make this headset a must have for the price. When it comes to sound quality, the headset sounds beautiful, very close to high priced headsets. The mic quality is amazing as well. I have a friend whom has I think an Astro A40 and he came over and tested this out, on team speak, he sounded almost exactly the same as he did on his Astro headset. I am not saying this is as good as Astros nor am I saying it is better, but for the price, it is definitely way better than a ton of headsets.	2015-08-06

US	15096631	R193RO9RCS4X2M	B00DHF39HQ	32807762	The Elder Scrolls Online	Video Games	2	2	4	N	Y	Not the MMO I wanted to play	You know something is amiss when your product price drops $20 a month after your pre-order arrives. And while I resisted reading up on this game before buying it, this experience has made me question if future Elder Scrolls games will be instant buy like they have been in the past, I certainly will not be buying another MMO from Zenimax. I can speak from the experience that I have put in enough time to have two veteran ranked characters and have completed the Domain campaign with them both.<br /><br />I have played as both a vampire and werewolf, and I'm not impressed with either, they feel tacked on in my opinion. Why not have a normal infection rate of 0.0001% rather than having players spawn camping for hours at a time? This would also make player-to-player infection more valuable.<br /><br />All in all, the main game is serviceable with my main gripe being that each area is essentially walking you up levels. Battles with mobs are typically easy, repeatable, and tends to get boring. You don't seem to gather much experience for leveling just battling, it seems you'll level up more by completing quests. The line of sight for mobs is laughable, you can get within about 5 feet of their face before they're alerted. The only times I've been defeated by mobs is when I've been outnumbered 4:1 or worse, which your battles are staged around 2 or 3 to 1. There aren't very many surprises either, no random high trophy hunts to have (like the leader of a wolf pack for example). However, there are seemingly random portals that spawn 5-6 daedric mobs, but they're always in the same places on the map.<br /><br />Things that made both Oblivion and Skyrim fun have been removed. Things like schools of magic, the assassins and thieves guilds (though you can steal and fence items), and a feeling of sheer scope of the world. In their places are (more or less) sliced-up neatly leveled areas, awkwardly designed classes, and shoehorned alliances for the sake of story. You will find out that your quest is being completed at the same times as others are doing them, too. And if you're up against a quest boss, and someone else kills it, guess what? You're done too! Without the challenge of fighting it, and if you didn't damage it, you lost out on their loot, too.<br /><br />Crafting is a rub because you really don't have to craft anything to be successful in the campaigns. I actually sold all my materials for everything below rank 46-50 since it was just taking up space in my bank. The research function is arbitrarily long for no reason except to make it seem like you're actually getting more skilled. It takes several (or more days) for one piece once several attributes are already done, but you can craft an entire set of metal armor or cook a whole meal in mere seconds.<br /><br />I actually had to give up on learning enchanting because of the sheer time sink required for a marginal benefit over what you can find in the wild. Potions aren't really required to learn, as they're less effective than healing abilities, and food/drinks are also plentiful from drops.<br /><br />Playing PvP actually irked me enough to cancel my subscription. If you aren't at least veteran rank 8 by now, you won't be effective at all, even though you can join in as low as player rank 10 (or 48 levels lower). I don't understand this, as wild mobs are veteran rank 12, no less, no more. I had a hard time understanding why Cyrodiil was is huge and wide open while the campaigns felt cramped and overpopulated. You can't PvP unless you're in Cyrodiil, no duels, no bounties, no guild wars. And instead of helping newer players enter the PvP area, they rewarded people who play the game more with scaled-up armor and stats and even champion points. Also, there are no trophies for PvP, no body looting for any sort, and really no reason to fight for anything other than to fight for castles on the map or dumbed down elder scrolls. Why not have a reason to fight for one of the cities? Why arethere no NPC mercenaries from the towns who'd fight for whoever pays them the most? Why does this Elder Scroll give me only 2% defense boost, but can alter the flow of time in Skyrim? Less than inspired in this gamers opinion.<br /><br />Issues I see (and some rants): People aren't really grouping for dungeons, and they're scaled against one person attempts. Why not just scale down your rewards instead? Better loot for better groups.<br />People don't group for campaigns, since they're too easy to not require them. Why not have mob hunts that require grouping?<br />Being a one person force in Cyrodiil is suicide, unless you're a veteran rank 14 kiting about a dozen people, because youre stats are scaled so high.<br />Why is there a bounty system, but players can't posse up to hunt you?<br />Every stolen item is priced at 30.<br />I got the customer service rep to agree with me that Coldharbour siege items are game breakers, as they don't have either a displayed projectile or impact area like all the others do.<br />No auction house, and guild traders seem to be heavily overpriced.<br />A distinct lack of legendary gear before veteran ranks.<br /><br />There's more, but this is running a bit long...	2015-08-06

I never post on amazon, but I just had to on this.<br />Rent before you throw your hard earned money to Bethesda.<br />I wanted to like this .... really really wanted to like this, but in the end ... ill be waiting for fallout to fill that RPG need.<br /><br />Probs<br />1) Gotta love going on a quest only to have the dungeon mostly cleared by the 30 other people who got there just a little before you did. No more slow methodical approach ... nope run in blazing cause odds are, youll be lucky to get a couple hits in before the boss goes down. Stategy element ... gone. Sense of accomplishment ... gone. Wanting to play in your own style ... gone. It frickin sucks !!!!!!! I like to go in stealthy, picking guys away ... nope, they're either all dead or with 5 people all running in to claim the kill, you may as well rush in as well or else you're shooting dead corpses pretending you killed em just the same<br /><br />2) So may missions of go to A, go to B, report back to A, go to C etc. You can spend hours doing nothing but errands.<br />3) Storyline so drab (along with #2 above) that when a decision point came along, I was so bored, lost and couldn't care less.<br />4) Enemies respawn quickly at the same point every time. No mystery. No clearing a room and being able to run back to safety (no need with #1 above) or just sitting tinkering with equipment (or going to the bathroom / fridge) over a dead body only to have his double reappear in his place and start attacking you<br />5) They've complicated things greatly from Skyrim.<br /><br />At least in destiny, which shares some of this, they limit the amount of people in an area to a much greater extent, and when your on a mission, its just you (and your group) and the others vanish. You clear a room the way you want and progress without myriads of other people battling you for kills or 10 of you placing a stone emblem on the same pedestal, all doing the exact same mission at the same time in chaotic semi-unison  and fighting over treasure.<br /><br />in a word its an MMO gone mad. The solo element of Skryim blows.<br /><br />Boring, tedious and unrewarding. You only keep playing hoping it gets better or you'll adjust .... it doesn't and you wont.<br /><br />oh ... and a ridiculous cap on what you can carry, restricted fast travel (like the witcher) ... just other peeves of mine.<br /><br />Hard to find a redeeming quality. Rent for a day and see if once your in the game play even just a few hours, if this mass hysteria works for you before you buy.<br /><br />Ill say this ... I had no server issues on PS4 with these guys ... there was at least that.<br /><br />but man ... this was the biggest disappointment I've had in gaming in a very long time . Wish I could get my $50 back.	2015-08-06

The Witcher 3, quite simply, exceeded all of my expectations and now stands in my mind as one of the best CRPGs I have ever played, if not the best.  Having played and enjoyed the other two Witcher games, I expected a solid RPG experience with an interesting story and some memorable characters.  What I did not expect was to be drawn so deeply into a beautifully and painstakingly crafted world for dozens upon dozens of hours.<br /><br />Every aspect of the Witcher 3 is simply amazing.  The story is compelling.  The characters are interesting and memorable. Even the smallest side-quests are given life and meaning.  The world is beautiful, detailed, and feels like a living place. Combat is solid, and there is a very robust crafting system. And, most interesting, the choices the player is required to make are difficult, weighty, and often have consequences that do not become apparent until many hours letter.  In fact, I enjoyed this game so much that I read each of the Witcher novels and short story collections, all of which only added to my enjoyment of the game and put some of the characters and events in context.<br /><br />Move over Skyrim, Baldur's Gate II, Dragon Age.  The Witcher 3 has raised the bar.<br /><br />As an aside, the game runs flawlessly (60+ fps) on my PC, which is an i5 with GeForce 970GT, with most settings on Ultra but Nvidia Hairworks off.  I have encountered very few bugs, though the game did crash to my desktop a couple of times (changing from Fullscreen to Windowed mode seemed to fix that issue).	2015-08-06

US	44077392	RLDMG6SOZT9G7	B00VBZVFSO	41184559	F1 2015 - Parent	Video Games	4	5	5	N	N	Good. Not great.	I'll start off by saying that I respect everyone's opinions on this game. To each their own. Games are often highly subjective. But, I don't understand why some are saying this is a terrible game. I'll just share a few of my thoughts about it.  First, the graphics aren't bad. They aren't great though. They're somewhere in between. The weather effects are nice and the car models are well done. Some of tracks look great (Monaco for example), but some look bland (Spa and Silverstone for example). But when concentrating on racing it doesn't really matter too much. The character models are ok. You can tell who is who by looking at them. But they're not anything to write home about. Again, they're adequate.  The presentation is the biggest disappointment for me. They advertised it like it was going to be like a live broadcast. It's not even close and doesn't capture the atmosphere of a Formula 1 race. It does better than previous installments. But there's a lot more work to be done.  I'm fine with the game modes. As a person that doesn't like playing any kind of licensed sports games as my own created character, I like the new championship mode. I've been wanting to race as actual drivers for awhile. It feels more authentic for me. Personally, I don't like creating characters and using them. But I can see how that's a huge deal to some.  It's lacking a little bit in the settings for races. I'd like to be able to choose an exact number of laps per race. Some choices feel too short, while the next option feels too lengthy sometimes. I would like to able to have a full practice session, 3 session qualifying, but then have a shorter race if I choose to. I don't know if you can change that. If you can, I haven't found it yet. Basically, I love being able to have the 3 session qualifying, but don't want to have to do a full race to do it. At least not all the time. The settings for the cars seem to be adequate enough for my taste. Although, diehard purests may want more. I don't use any of the assists. So I can't speak towards that.  The handling seems to be fine to me. I find it better and more responsive than previous years. Although, it could be refined some. Especially for controller use. (Yes, some people still prefer a controller. Especially those of us not wanting to drop hundreds of dollars on a steering wheel and setup.)  The sound is what you would expect. Everything seems in order there. Nothing to complain about other than the commentary before the races is a little dull. And when it is supposed to be exciting, it seems to try too hard.  Final thoughts: As a huge F1 fan that watches all the races, I'm giving this a solid 4 stars. I like the ability to play as my favorite drivers. This isn't the huge step forward that Codemasters said it would be. Or even that it should have been. But I think it's an improvement and a step in the right direction. I'd also like to see the classic mode return.	2015-08-06

Even able to stream quickly enough for online games such as Destiny and Elder Scrolls. The only drawback is that video service apps are not available on the PStv and also not able to stream Hulu or Netflix from a ps4/ps3.	2015-08-06

[Japan Import]	Video Games	5	1	1	N	Y	even if you don't have a good grasp on the Japanese language	To start off, even if you don't have a good grasp on the Japanese language, you can still play this game without much trouble. The tutorials are complete with pictures, and if you've ever seen the anime you'll know exactly what's happening in the plot when it happens.<br /><br />This game's mostly about the missions. You play as Tiger, and your goals are pretty much the same as they are in the TV series; get the bad guy, save the victims, impress the audience, and send a shout-out to your sponsors all within five minutes to earn points and boost your Hero Rank. It's a good ol' beat 'em up is what it is, son. Each map I've played so far has been different, with lots of little nooks and crannies to explore. There are various &#34;happening&#34; points that allow you to keep your viewers entertained while you scramble after the suspects, and you actually have some incentive to get them. People become less impressed with what you've got to show the longer you walk around or the more hits you take. As another feature, you can get one of the other heroes to cut in for you and raise your audience rating or take some damage for you. This is REALLY helpful during boss battles.<br /><br />(Side note: This isn't really important, but they included a point reduction for when you break public property in battle. I just thought it was cool that they paid so much attention to detail.)<br /><br />The only real complaint I have is that the camera can be dizzying, and the controls flip whenever it changes. It's frustrating, but it's easy to look over.<br /><br />As for the shipment, I ordered it new without expediting it. It arrived in about 20 days, which I think is a perfectly reasonable amount of time for imports. It came in perfect condition. Included with the manual are a little sticker sheet with all the characters and a Barnaby card with a serial code on the back.<br /><br />In short, it's pretty much as close to being a real anime superhero that you'll ever get. It's really addicting, and I totally recommend it to anyone that likes T&B.ddicting, and I totally recommend it to anyone that likes T&B.	2015-08-06

At the end of the day, it's all about the function (and I think most customers would agree). The PS4 is notorious for getting very hot very fast (sometimes within the first 30 minutes of gameplay), so I believed this stand would solve that. The product totes that the stand has &#34;powerful&#34; fans that will keep your PS4 cool, which is, of course, entirely false. There are only two fans (one in the front and one in the back, at least four inches apart—terrible placement) and they spin so slowly that they barely provide any cooling. Also, once the PS4 is positioned on the stand, the fans are trapped underneath it, so there is no ventilation. If anything, the fans will just keep pushing the hot air back into your system  (because, if you didn't know, the cooling vents on the PS4 are ON THE SIDES, and the stand blocks out an ENTIRE SIDE), which is very, very bad. The seller's product description regarding the fans is incredibly misleading. I do not recommend this product to anyone who is having PS4 cooling issues. This product may actually worsen the problem, so stay away from it.<br /><br />TL;DR:<br />If you need to cool your PS4, do not buy this stand. It will not help the situation and could actually make it worse! Waste of money, so stay away!	2015-08-06

This was $70 more than the same bundle I could have gotten at target, which was rather disappointing.  I should have done my research a bit better before splurging on this item.  I know that most stores are sold out of this black Friday bundle, and this may be the best deal for all of these games, considering it is tax-free.

The 360 version is a sloppy port of what is a otherwise not-too-bad game on other consoles. You have to deal with:<br /><br />- Extreme load times, upwards of 2 minutes.<br />- Can't install to hard drive which exacerbates already long loading.<br />- In-game loading drops the frame rate to the point of being unplayable, you have to stand and wait for it to finish for 20-30 seconds.<br />- Numerous game bugs (textures randomly changing or disappearing, audio dropping out entirely, bad hit detection)<br />- Very poor controls that don't resemble the tight, responsive control system in Re4/Re5/ReRev regardless of the configuration. The game was clearly designed for a mouse and keyboard first with the console controls as an afterthought.<br />- Cumbersome aiming: holding any direction while aiming a weapon locks the camera and the direction you are facing, so you have to center the left trigger every single time you shoot.<br /><br />Capcom did a rush job on porting this to the 360 with little concern about the quality or playability of the result. No patches since the release date have addressed any of these issues. It seems unlikely they'll ever fix it at this point.<br /><br />About the game itself: For people that liked Resident Evil Revelations, other than sharing some graphical assets this game has nothing to do with that one. It's a sequel in name only with a completely different look and feel. It isn't bad though, and Resident Evil fans will probably want to pick it up.<br /><br />Given all these issues I'd only recommend getting it for cheap (under $10). Or get it on the PS4 or XBox One where it isn't so broken.	2015-08-06

I decided to pick this game up since I'm collecting the whole BN series and I had previously owned it when it first dropped when I was younger and I loved it! Was very surprised at the price it was going for since it was considerably cheaper than BN1 and BN2, but easily one of the best. The graphics may seem somewhat decent some people, but for its time, you have to admit the graphics were and still are pretty dope (IMO). The amount and type of battle chips in this game are nice and the style changes are pretty cool not to mention the good ol' navi cust which lets you add some pretty nifty extra features to Mega Man. The story was pretty solid to me and if you know Mega Man games. Of course he has to save the world again with the help of his friends and others along the way. Mega Man fans will know what I mean by this statement lol. The longevity of the game is somewhat fair and if you like doing extra areas, missions, etc, it becomes much longer. The bosses and overall battles in this game have been by far the most difficult of any MMBN game that I have played. Those who watch the Mega man series will be disappointed (or please) to know that the games for the most part DO NOT follow the series. With that all said, I honestly recommend picking this up before its price possibly ups as much as BN1 or BN6. This was a really great game when I was younger and it still is. If the game is enjoyed for what it is and not compared in any kind of way to the series or any other Mega Man installations, then you'll definitely love it.	2015-08-06

I haven't played fighting games in something like 10 years and MKX was a great place to start again. There's a staggering amount of content here and the mediocre training mode doesn't really help acclimate you, but I eventually got into a groove and I can now hold my own in the normal difficulty. I personally like fighting with Ferra/Torr and Jason, but, again, so much content here that I haven't even begun to skim the surface.<br /><br />The fighting games I remember from my teenage years weren't exactly known for groundbreaking story modes, but the underlying tale of MKX is one of the more enjoyable 4-6 hours that I've spent with a video game recently. It's cheesy, sure, but also charming and heartfelt (especially for a game in which you're regularly tearing people in half). Props to the developer.<br /><br />The statue and packaging are beautiful.

I finally threw in the towel on Destiny a few weeks ago to join my friends in ESO. At first I wasn't so sure but I'm up to level 15 now and finding it more enjoyable. Like Destiny it is best played with friends so as long as mine keep playing I plan to stick around.  Thought I would come back and update this review now that I've been playing a little longer... Once I hit level 20 the game hit a turning point and I find it less confusing. I think this is mostly because I have become accustomed to the controls and the interface. I've never really played an MMO before but at level 26 now I think I will stick with this one for some time.	2015-08-06

What it does is applied the same kind of dampening effect the glasses has, directly on your monitor so your eyes won't hurt from the bright light. These glasses do work because they reduce the light that is received from the screen that you're looking at. I do notice that my eyes hurt a lot less when using these, but since I already wear glasses, it made it difficult to use this item. Either I wear these glasses in front of my regular ones, which is really annoying, or just use these glasses alone and can't see anything.	2015-08-06

The product came at the end of its &#34;estimated shipping arrival&#34; date, and although I wasn't expecting immaculacy, the case was beat, dented, chipped, water-logged, and torn. The manual had seen better days too, but that was of little concern. All would have been well, had the disk been functional. Unfortunately, the disk wouldn't run, had cracks and scrapes throughout, and had peeling data stickers. It took a resurfacing, a new sticker, and a scratch filling to make the disk run.  2/5 considering it made it here, and they had the decency to include the manual.	2015-08-06

I had never heard of it before, until I did an impromptu search for games by Ubisoft and found it in the list. A quick view of what the game was like on YouTube and I decided to try it. The story is interesting, and teases you all the way to the end. It has challenging puzzles and the gameplay mechanics are easy to master. I'm not a huge fan of 1st person style gameplay, but it worked well in this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Since you play as one type of character (mage, warrior, assassin, etc...) you can play the game more than once using a different skill set each time. You can also choose whether to be evil or good, which will change the story as well. If you like Oblivion, Dragon Age or The Witcher, I think you will really enjoy this game as well. There are multi-player online options of play as well, that will further extend your enjoyment of the game.	2015-08-06

After you beat a chapter go to achievements an tap the present box, you will unlock all the rangers this way. It took me 4 chapters to figure that out..thats 24 missions due to poor directions. You hack and slash with 3 attacks. charge,light/heavy,and special. The special is not to be confused with the ultimate attack which is only acquired after saving special attack bars. The music is nice especially in the shop. The rangers are fun for any gan but wont be knocking your socks off..that said it never gets old using the mighty mophin ranger or the green rangers sword. The game is fun but is for kids and does have cheesy Victory lines. I personally love power rangers and think this is a major improvement over the garbage of megaforce. I say port this game to console with better visuals and add dlc characters..but then again a 3ds exclusive with double the rangers would also be welcome. Good game to play for any die hard 20+yr old out there wanting a small taste of nostalgia. 👍	2015-08-06

I've loved The Walking Dead games since the first one I beat all the way through. Have yet to go ahead and finish this one. I loved Clementine since the first game. She's not as sweet and innocent in this game, but at the same time she's not as little anymore and had some really bad experiences in this game along with what happened in the first one. It's like a real world zombie scenario where you gotta worry about not only zombies but supplies, bandits, and betrayal. That's what I love so much about this series. It's pretty current with the times. And the way the scenarios were constructed are pretty much a masterpiece.	2015-08-06

This case can hold your Playstation Vita, the entire charger, 20 games, and 2 memory sticks at once! It also comes with a separate case which can hold 8 games and 2 memory sticks aside from that! The case itself feels really nice and durable, and the zippers aren't made out of typical cheap plastic. The games are held by an elastic black band which secures the games and prevent them from falling off but you may need to take them out to see which one they are. Aside from that, no complains about this case. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.	2015-08-06

I put a lot of time in with MKX on the xbox one using a Razer atrox as my primary peripheral. I have now switched to PC, since most of the issues I had with mkx at launch are now mostly fixed. I first tried a ps4 controller because of a friend's recommendation and I preferred it over my atrox stick.(also because on the atrox two of my buttons were instantly disabled when plugging into a pc.) I then saw this gamepad on amazon and decided to give it a shot since it is made by Hori.<br /><br />I don't think I can use anything else for Mortal Kombat now, all my inputs register perfectly with this gamepad.<br />Was worried that the right side of the pad would be hard to get used to, but I have zero issues. For PC users I didn't have to install any drivers, plugged this in using windows 10 and had zero issues.	2015-08-06
