After beating the campaign a few years ago, I hopped on the multiplayer using the PS Network a week ago and was surprised to see it alive and well.  There are lots of players still playing this.  It is a huge game with so much to unlock on both the single player and online multiplayer modes.  However, online is very hard.  Most everyone is maxed out in rank (with all the advanced weapons and gear) and it's hard to tell if they cheated their way or not.  Also, many times on certain levels like Rust and Afghan, people will be jumping around really high and killing everyone.  They look really wierd.  I see many cheaters.  It is highly addictive to play despite those things.  I hope the other COD online is this much fun.	2015-08-24

This was the first third party hardware I purchased for my Xbox One. I am a Day One owner of the console and picked up this charger about two days later. I had a little trouble getting the battery and cover properly seated, but not to the level of frustration. I am not crazy about the design of the charger itself. The battery must connect with the charging element exactly and if one does not CAREFULLY place the controller into the &#34;saddle,&#34; no charging will occur, even though all appears properly seated. Yes, there is a light indicating that the controller is in place as well as a (very) small red/green light which crudely indicates the charge level of the battery. One would think all is well if the indicator is lit. However, the light does not stay on. Sometimes, the controller would be fully charged even though the indicator was not lit. Other times, there would be no charge. I found the best solution was to NOT sit the charger flat on a table or shelf. When I did this, the battery and charging contact would sometimes separate. Instead, I place the charger on a 45 degree angle, so that gravity aids in pushing the controller against the charging contact.<br /><br />The batteries I began using in November 2013 are STILL viable. I play Destiny 3-4 hours daily and the batteries show no sign of weakening. I give the charger 4 stars in spite of the issues I have had with it. I blame Microsoft for what appears to me to be a lineup of truly odd shaped chargers, the Nyko among the earliest of them. The Xbox 360 had rechargeable batteries that were easily removed from the controllers and snapped into a small, esthetically pleasing charging station. The Xbox One has required the entire controller to be involved in the charging process. What was Microsoft thinking? In the sense of design, it's a step backwards.	2015-08-24

As a frequent player of eroge/visual novels, I was not sure how this game would play since I'm used to reading dialogue and changing character expressions. After seeing that this is fully animated with subtitles, I gained more interest since it's completely new to me. This is a great take on doing visual novels differently. The playback quality is smooth, moments are unexpected depending on your choices, character development is just as good as the anime itself, and the adult scenes don't hold back anything. This was a great buy and I'd definitely recommend.	2015-08-24

Don't hesitate on buying these. I wore mine out a week ago playing God of War 3 and I was originally planning on sending them to Sony for a replacement. The rubbers wear out on some Playstation 4 controllers that are first generation.  Long story short, delivery was quick, and easy to install. My original were split in the center which created a &#34;lift&#34; on the rubber in the center that could be felt. I was skeptical at first, but after they arrive they fit perfectly. I removed the split rubbers from the old controller by hand. They come right off with no resistance or left over residue. Slide these sideways and they wrap around perfectly. They are slightly loose, but not overly and when playing they stay still. This was probably made that way so you could angle them in from any direction and then straighten them once on. They look nice and make the controller stand out. You could possibly add these on a controller that are not worn out like mine for extra grip.  Pros: solid grip, they look nice once on, adding a little flare and originality to your controller. (i'll upload an image) Cons: The only con I can find by being picky would be they can be ripped while putting them on the controller. This can be avoided by simply going slow and angle them sideways when installing. After in &#34;locks&#34; in one side, you can slide the rest on and pat it on the top so it slides under it.	2015-08-24

In my mind, infinitely replayable - sure the actual settings repeat BUT the loot grabs make up for it - especially with the chance of an orange mixed in. For those who don't know what an &#34;orange&#34; is, get the game and find out. Each playable character brings its own nuances to the game. The Humor is top notch.<br /> The option of golden keys (via the net) is a nice touch. Thanks Gearbox.<br />I also have original Borderlands GOTY on both PC and PS3 - still replayable (every so often, i'll dust it off and &#34;catch a riiiiiiiiiiiidddddddddddddde&#34;)<br />Can't wait for BL3.	2015-08-24

It can be down right rough at times and its freeware gameplay is apparent in the required grinding of characters.<br /><br />The Mario version on the game is cool for a while. At some point though, you realize the untapped potential and the multiple Mario characters that go unused. No real story here. I grew tired of yet another version of a Koopa I had to level up.<br /><br />In short, a good way to pass the time. Do I expect too much from a game with Mario in it? Probably.	2015-08-24

Very deep with lots of various resources to harvest, lots of things to make and steps.  For example, a grain farm and a grain mill to make flour, water and flour for the bakery, which makes bread for the coal miners.  Coal and iron ore to the smelter.  Iron bars and coal to the weapons maker.  Weapons to the barracks where you can create units.  Meat for the iron miners.  Fish for the gold miners.  There are also sulfur and stone miners.  Lumberyards, stone cutters (from stone on the map rather than mines).  Harbors, heavy weapons, etc, etc, etc.<br />Perfect controls on the various buildings.<br />Very deep - magic, thieves, etc, in addition to various levels of combat units.<br />Land must be cleared, things must be built.  (Rather than just popping up like Stronghold.)<br />Various civilian units must have tools to do their job - made at the tool works.  It all is awesomely integrated.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The absolute worst is that the AI goes insane on unit creation.  I was trucking along, doing nicely and built two groups of combat units with 45 each - what I thought was a good army - bigger than most other games.  When I went to attack, they were obliterated by hundreds.  I built hundreds on a retry, with 5 large towers, goaded him into attacking me and it still wasn't enough.  It was ridiculous and ruined this game.  This was on the Easy setting.  On Easy, it should continue with its tower building, but only have a handful of units at each tower, not hundreds overall.  There is no way to control this setting.<br />No walls nor gates and the AI attacks everywhere.<br />The mines seem to stop producing, but there was no reason why.<br />The priest spell to “replenish resources” didn't seem to to anything.<br />The Fog of War is way overdone - most of the time I couldn't see a thing and I really hate that.<br />Defenses are fairly weak.<br />Civilian buildings and civilians are not attacked.  You can only attack defensive emplacements and soldiers.  This is just weird.  Well, some civilians can be attacked, like your geologists (used to find ore) and pioneers (used to push back the territory boundaries).  Buildings explode when territory is claimed, and that, too, is just weird.	2015-08-24

First time we hooked it up we thought we had bad cables: a loud static noise and snowy image.  Then we realized we messed up the two Red connectors (apparently it DOES matter) and everything works wonderfully.  Sharp picture (but don't expect ultra high def, silly).  Clear audio.

After being out of the gaming world since pretty much only playing TonyHawk games on a used ps2, Bloodborne was my first plunge into modern gaming. It's absolutely beautiful and an insanely rewarding and terrifying experience. I have to mentally and emotionally prepare myself before playing every time. As frustrating as I had heard it was going to be, but it has a fast learning curve. It's as much a memory game as a suspense filled nightmare. The variety of enemies with unique attack speeds and timings provides a test of offensive and defensive combat tactics. You'd be a fool not to get this game.	2015-08-24

I hadn't necessarily heard the greatest things about any of the DS versions, but this thing is awesome. As a Nintendo kid it's just a nice thing to have when you want to play the newest versions of Nintendo's updated classics without having to depend on whatever console(s) you have; as someone who likes video games, it's nice to have just for a quick bit of playing to get out of your head and enjoy some moderately challenging, but very addicting games.<br /><br />The overall 3D aspect of it is rather funky, but it doesn't really take away from anything, because you can turn the 3D on and off very easily. Also, it's about as stupid as anything can get that the charger doesn't come with it, and you actually have to either order it separately or get this bundle. But I guess it just wouldn't be Nintendo if there wasn't some kind of terrible product marketing!	2015-08-24

Easy to play, great intro to the game (and to MLB, if that is important). They can play it without knowing anything about baseball, but also pick up things at their own pace that they may not easily pickup from playing TBall or watching a baseball game. Different pitches, leading off, positions and their different skill requirements, etc. The Nick characters make it fun, mixed with MLB players. Outstanding game for the kids and Dad.	2015-08-24

Some of the games in this collection freeze up while your playing particularly Sly 2. If not for that I would have given this collection 4 stars. I love Sly Cooper but after the first game the series became a bit of a drag with the games hitting the 14+ hour mark of gameplay. Completely unnecessary for a platformer. The original game clocked in around 7 hours which was about perfect and didn't drag you down with inane storylines and constant repetitive tasks. There's a lot of poor design decisions in the later games as well. Example: The devs will make it a chore for you to get your next mission which involves jumping up somewhere that isn't immediately obvious and when you finally make it to the designated spot you only receive a mission briefing. All that work just for a mission briefing. Anyway like I mentioned I like the Sly games a lot but I'll always prefer the first game in the series for its more simplistic and straightforward formula.	2015-08-24

I have been an Assassin's Creed fan from the very beginning when I first bought my PS3. It has gone a very long way as you can agree. Being that this is for a next-gen console the graphics are truly stunning and beautiful. France is alive full of detailed buildings and surroundings that truly make you appreciate every climb and synchronization. However, when it comes to the characters, combat system, and glitches, there are many flaws. First, at some points in the game the characters look real and detailed but most often the characters are a little cartoonish and leave out what would make them truly look human. Secondly, what I found to be most disappointing and frustrating is the combat system and stealth. They threw out the easy parry system and chain kills which I thought were pretty badass in AC3 and Revelations. Which brings up the point that many AC games in the past would have new skills or upgrades that had us on the edge of our seat in anticipation. But when it came to a sequel they would throw out what we loved and try to come up with a new, better weapon or skill which failed to impress. The AI in the game are much more advanced, meaning they are quicker, give and cause more damage, and can spot you almost everytime you try to be stealthy. I agree it was easier before but now things have gotten really frustrating. When you try to flee because of the large amounts of enemies (which will happen) it takes more effort to become anonymous and somehow they succeed in shooting from a far distance even while you are moving. Also, the parry system is not as very responsive so often times you will be stabbed. Overall, the game has its hits and misses and I definitely miss the old combat and AI system and the excitement I once had. The one definite hit it has is its graphics, which was barely enough for me to truly enjoy the game.	2015-08-24

Good value in this bundle, as well, as you get two games with some online value, a month of Gold and a headset in addition to the normal, expected goodies. Easy setup, as well. I had to migrate old data from an original 360 that crapped out, so I used the hard drive transfer cable to import my old hard drive, and had other data on a 16gb thumb drive. All of the data was moved to this new 360 with no problems, and relatively quickly. Happy customer!	2015-08-24

Awsome game only if you install the ultimate universe 2.0 mod. It will make this game totally different with significant upgrades and improvements.

This game without the mod is maybe a two star. The mod will make it 5. Not to mention you get to play with 6 races and tons of new ships, missions and Awsome multiplayer.

For a comparison if you are playing your ps4 and it's starting to get out it makes like a loud Fan noise just the ps4 alone. If you connect the cooler yes it makes a little noise but it's lower then when u didn't have a cooler on it. The ps4 noise alone is 10 times louder with out the cooling fan.<br /><br />2nd con : If you are moving the wires back there like the a/c cord or the hdmi, it might slide out off place but if you leave the weird alone it will stay where it needs to be.	2015-08-24

I have had this game brand new from GameStop for the PS3<br />I bought it digitally on Amazon.com<br />I purchased a physical copy due to the Amazon downloader not functioning properly (just put in a new SSD and reformatted my computer)<br />That physical copy will be returned, and I may or may not purchase another one.<br /><br />Be careful with merchants on Amazon:<br />I am not happy with the used copy I received from a merchant, as the booklet was soaked. The game had been resealed with a bunch of moisture inside the case. The code was &#34;unused,&#34; but should have actually been labelled as &#34;useless&#34; instead, due to ink running and pages sticking.	2015-08-24

I waffled between a 3 and a 4 - settled on 4 stars.  We have only played a couple games as a &#34;Family&#34; most have been as single player.  Tried the Sorry, but really confused as to how it works.  Doesn't seem intuitive at all.  I'll go back through the tutorial.  Some of the games - especially Yahtzee - there are no second chances once you click.  So if you are a bit wobbly pointing with the remote, you are screwed.  Also on that, it seemed that you could be dead on with your selection and it would pick something else.  Have kind of enjoyed Operation & Pictureka.  My wife and I really do like Boggle. The sounds get a bit annoying so the sound goes off A LOT! The lack of choosing established Wii Characters on the 1st set is kind of a bummer.  Moving from one game to another is a bit cludgy as well. I think it will be fun for some winter evenings, but it has not &#34;blown my socks off&#34;.  So glad I found the 2 pack for a few dollars more than buying only 1.  I realize that my review sounds over all negative, which really comes back to it could have be MUCH better in my opinion, but it is ok and I'm not really sorry I bought it.	2015-08-24

I've been buying it for a few years, and it's saved my kids from cracked screens many times. This particular product, however, is just awful. My husband purchased it elsewhere for my daughter's 3DS XL (not the new 3DS LL). It does *not* fit! The console has far too much room and slips around inside, the case itself is a flimsy design compared to the old 3DS XL armor, it's smooth instead of textured and thus easier to drop, and because it's too large, the console constantly falls out. I have not tried it on my new 3DS LL, but I assume it's sized to fit it. There is a tray or something to adapt it to fit the XL better, but this has fallen out (again, bad design), and without it, the console slides around. (Note: we finally found the adapter tray again. It really does come out far too easily. The whole thing pops apart with ridiculous ease)  If you have the older 3DS XL, *do not buy this*! It's a frustrating waste of money. Try to find the old, console-specific armor instead. And even if the fit wasn't an issue, frankly I wouldn't recommend it anyway due to the inferior design and quality.  Edited to add: For all of you who keep telling me it's MY fault it doesn't fit because it's for the new DS LL, LOOK AGAIN. It clearly states it is for BOTH the old DS XL and the new DS LL. The packaging, which is not shown here, states that as well.	2015-08-24

The most notable for me was the d-pad since I play a lot of fighters. With the original controller, (as good as it is), when I tried to do specific moves that required precise pushing of the space in between the directions, I would have to attempt it multiple times since it was thick and uncomfortable to fully utilize even when doing basic movements. This controller has a slimed-downed d-pad which is much more comfortable and allows easier precision movements. It even feels better for non-fighting games. Second are the impulse triggers which feel much more responsive than the standard one. Sometimes the regular one would seem like it was off a bit with syncing up the rumble to match the corresponding event happening in the game albeit not by that much but still noticeable. It feels more on point with this one. Chat audio seems to transmit clearer through the controller, almost like it got a boost in quality. The differences won't be apparent to you until you really use it for a little while which is why I'm just now reviewing it because I wanted to take some time to adjust to it and figure out whats different with it, and I think that 24 days was plenty of time. Speaking of chat audio, as much as I like this controller it's going to get 1 star knocked off simply because with all the improvements I don't see why microsoft couldn't put in a built-in audio jack. I have the adapter, but it would be a no brainer to me, the $150 elite controller has one so why not this one? I guess if you're going to pay THAT MUCH for a controller, it better have audio jacks built in right? lol. Anyhow, these were my thoughts on the controller, I highly reccomend if you play fighters alot to invest in it ,(the d-pad really is better on it.) Also if you just want a slightly better controller that's not $150 then this might be for you.	2015-08-24

I bought a pair of these for my XB1 controller. It worked okay, but wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. So I decided to do some research to see if I could find a better option.

Hello!<br />These thumb grips work well as, well, thumb grips. the only bad side to them would be that they can slightly get in the way when needed to push the stick far to one side, for example in moving up and down through a menu.

Other than that, they are very comfortable to use and are great for keeping the controller in good condition, and not wearing out the rubber on the stick itself.<br />Thanks!	2015-08-24

If you have characters from the original game, fear not, they'll do just fine. There are many levels of difficulty to try for those experienced players, which keeps the game very challenging and the bounties in adventure mode is a great idea to build up your cash.<br /><br />I wish they would have a large stash for each character instead a combined one, or better yet have both.	2015-08-24

It has a Nintendo logo visibly stamped (clear) on the front, but it's not that big of a deal to me. I believe it's been one month since I've bought it, and it seems to show slight signs of yellowing. I have a white acnl, so it might not show up as much on other colors. It is kind of easily scratched, but will not be visible unless shone directly with light.

Nearly 2 months! I suppose there must be only one guy working on these. I am not sure.<br /><br />When it arrived, I realized that it did not come with everything listed on the website. The screen protector and earbuds were not included. I thought it was a minor issue so I ignored it. I was happy that it finally arrived. I first tested the video output on my TV and it worked as expected. It's my favorite feature. Next, I tested out the roms that were included and everything worked well. I mainly want to play original Gameboy games.<br /><br />I then decided to check out how the audio works with my headphones. This is where the problems begin. I go to plug in my 1/8&quot; audio jack and the entire port goes straight into the console like it was barely attached to the motherboard. I immediately contacted the creator and it took me 3 days to get him to understand what happened. I'm aware of the language barrier so I had to be patient with him.<br /><br />Once he finally understood, I asked for a replacement, but he told me that he couldn't do that and that I would have to sell it to someone who wouldn't mind a missing audio port. I told him that was not acceptable for a defective item and then he offered me $5 off my next order of the Crystal Black model. We went about 10 days of back and forth emails. I just wanted to return it and he just sending me a replacement when the next batch rolls out. He refused everything I asked him and he eventually sent me a measly $10 refund to my Paypal. After all of the frustration, I just accepted it. I know I could have disputed through Paypal, but that would have taken weeks and required me to pay $10 just to return ship. I thought it was best to just deal without an audio port.<br /><br />I ended up taking it apart to remove the audio port that was rattling around inside and I noticed that there is very little solder on most of the contacts. I may attempt to solder it back on, though I have little skills to do so.<br /><br />I just want to let everyone know that quality is not guaranteed with the Revo K101+. The creator was not rude, but I had a difficult time getting my problem solved for the broken audio port.me $5 off my next order of the Crystal Black model.

I got this headset so I could connect it to my Mac, iPad, or iPod to do dictation.<br /><br />Test 1: I played some music (on my iPod) and adjusted the volume of the speaker (using the controls on the headset’s cord) - it worked perfectly. Afterwards, I opened a voice recorder App and recorded some dictation - again it worked perfectly.<br /><br />Test 2: I plugged it in to the headphone port on my Mac and tested it with QuickTime - once I had the correct input device selected in the Sound Preferences - it again worked perfectly.<br /><br />Test 3: I plugged it into the microphone port of my “Syba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapter” that I use on an older Mac (that has the microphone jack on the back which to too far away for the cord to reach). It worked, but the sound was very faint - which is surprising since my other headset works fine with this adapter.<br /><br />Evaluation: It does what I want - recording dictation when it is plugged directly in to my Mac or iPad (with no adapter used). So I am thoroughly satisfied with its performance - though I think if I really wanted to listen to music, I would opt for a headset with two earphones to get a stereo effect.	2015-08-24

They knew the Xcom universe and had a good dream to make first person shooter out of it, but they obviously didn't have any idea how to make first person shooters. They needed to bring in experts in this kind of genre to help the design and build the games mechanics, controls and even 1st person shooter ideas for the Xcom universe, but sadly they obviously did not do that. Good or even great idea that is crushed because of terrible design and mechanics in the game.	2015-08-24

Sure, XBOX and PS4 have kickass graphics and are &#34;gamer&#34; machines, but the 3DS and its games are FUN.<br /><br />I bought Pokemon Omega Ruby just to see what the Pokemon craze is all about and I'm addicted.

Instead of the week consuming PC Civ game, you can accomplish this in one sit-down (three hours on easiest, but the difficulties will increase this quite nicely).<br /><br />Multitasking has essentially been removed from Civ Rev. Instead, you can focus on your goals and how you're going to win, and you no longer need to worry about funding that vast horde you built. One thing I found lacking was the diplomacy. Apparently, in order to keep it simple, it has been butchered down to &#34;Give me this, and if you don't, we're at war.&#34; It's every Civ for them self in this game, and if you're near to achieving a victory, they will make a desperate attempt to stop you.<br /><br />Combat still has that good `ole Civ feel of creating a powerful unit form countless victories. Units gain experience, and in Civ Rev also gain ranks, and then eventually purchase upgrades that can change how it fits into your strategy. A problem does arise that you can't upgrade a unit to its next advancement (i.e., you can't improve an archer into a musket man; it is, and will always will be, an archer). You can, however, sell of your units, so you're not forced to go on suicide missions with them.<br /><br />As far as graphics go, they're not top quality, neither are they bad. Fights are fun to watch, and the only annoying thing is your advisors, whose ubiquitous presence and pop-ins will begin to annoy some. But after awhile, they become more like an annoying friend more than anything. The sound isn't much, but this is probably a game where you will find yourself listening to your own music.<br /><br />One thing I'm sure will annoy PC veterans is no control over your map. It's usually one continent with a few islands (don't quote me on that, though), and I believe the size is the same. Still, the maps are different every game, providing an essentially limitless replay ability.<br /><br />Definitely different, but still a great game. $60, though? Play the demo off Xbox Live, or rent it for awhile, and if you find yourself getting hooked, than this will be worth it.m sure will annoy PC veterans is no control over your map.

I've bought this controller in December and have used it until both the PS3's in my possession YLOD'ed. I enjoyed the feel of the controller and it did the job. Eventually I stopped using it and when I wanted to try it once again, I had lost the dongle. I searched all over the net and on the manufacturer's website, but couldn't find it. I made a last ditch effort and sent an email to their support team. Much to my delight, they responded quickly and sent me another dongle free of charge. Great company.

I love my PS3 but it is too bulky to travel with so when Sony announced that they were bringing the VitaTV to the US, i couldn't wait to get my hands on it.<br />After having played with it for some time now, I find myself with more complaints than compliments about it.<br />First of all, don't expect it to replace your Roku or Chromecast.  While there's no technological reason why it can't do everything they can do, it just can't.  But I love my Chromecast so i'm perfectly content with using it instead of this.  Its just disappointing that this one device can't be the answer to all of my streaming and gaming needs when i travel.<br />I believe Sony pushed this out to try and rev up its Playstation NOW game streaming service, which is currently in Beta.  PS NOW, when it works, works well but expect to run a network cable over to the PSTV because the wifi is unreliable.  My only gripe with the PS NOW service is that I can't find where to adjust the subscription options.  Sony advertises two subscription plans ($20 per month or $45 per quarter) neither are a bargain for the casual gamer who spends less than $240 per year on new games.  It would be nice if my PlaystationPlus membership yielded me at least some discount on PS NOW.  But I accepted that $45 per quarter is a fair enough price.  Only problem is that theres no place to select this.  You sign up for a 7 day trial and once that trial period ends, it automatically rolls into the $20 per month plan.  Sounds trivial, but i can deal with the occasional network blips for $180 per year, but when they force me to pay $240 per year, those things just drive me insane.  Premium price for sub-premium service.<br />Another issue that I have is that not all Vita games are compatible.  Makes sense since Vita was designed with a touch screen, but most games aren't labeled as to whether or not they are PSTV compatible.  You either have to download all your titles, or research each one before you buy.<br />Speaking of downloading...This thing comes with a meager 1GB of storage which will allow you to store one good game.  That's it.  Want more than that?  Gonna have to buy a Vita memory card which costs about 5x as much as every other type of memory card out there.<br />It feels like Sony is doing everything they can to suck as much money out of their customers as they can get.  The problem is, had they done it right, we'd hand our money over willingly but because of the poor execution and corner cutting, I resent every penny that I am forced to give them and refuse to give them one cent more.<br />I fear that Sony will abandon this as a failed effort and we will never get to see the Playstation TV live up to its potential.  Although, if they do, the hackers will turn this thing into the perfect device.	2015-08-24

Fantastic game and great experience. Anyone that has played &#34;Guitar Hero&#34; or &#34;Karaoke Revolution&#34; knows the epic levels of fun to be had with these kinds of games. Not only do you get to live the fantasy of vocalist or lead guitarist, but you get to do it alongside some well-known tunes, some of which might be favorites of your own! With &#34;Rock Band&#34;, you take that to entirely new level by incorporating friends and family, in a co-operative way. For truly great gaming experiences, it is truly difficult to get better than this.<br />Each person can take turns with a different instrument and when you get tired of the tracks on one version of the game, you simply load up another (or purchase them from the online store, if your console supports DLC).<br /><br />The only gripe I had with my purchase was that the drumsticks were missing. Otherwise, the order process went as smoothly as could be expected: quick delivery, good contact with the seller, product (nearly) as described (again, except for the one missing part, but that's okay; bongo-style seems to work like a charm). Should I desire any other &#34;Rock Band&#34; accoutrements, I would do repeat business with SOSS.<br /><br />We now return you to your regularly schedule rocking, already in progress.	2015-08-24

I got these headphones to listen to classical music and for conferencing with my dev team, hoping to replace my ATH-M40fs studio monitors. Audio quality is important to me, and I want the sound to be as close to a live performance as possible. In general, I don't want my headphones to color the sound at all.<br /><br />My first impressions were mixed, but after my own adjustments, the phones became quite pleasant to listen to. They won't be replacing the M40fs, but they do sound pretty good, and the convenience and freedom is hard to beat.<br /><br />Sections:<br /><br />* Before anything else<br />* Connections<br />  * Microphone<br />  * Analog cable<br />  * Close range performance<br />  * Long range performance<br />* Audio quality<br />  * Equalizer<br />  * White noise<br />  * LF sine waves<br />  * Stereo imaging<br />* Conclusion<br /><br /># Before anything else<br />First, PLEASE NOTE that for best quality, use the optical base station or Bluetooth A2DP, which is designed for high-quality music.<br /><br />Also, note that the default is to process your audio heavily to focus on voice frequencies. This cuts out a lot of bass. MAKE SURE that you switch to game 1 and chat 1 audio profiles, which have flat frequency response for the most accurate sound.<br /><br /># Connections<br />## Microphone<br />If you are on Bluetooth and start using the microphone, the PX51 will switch from A2DP to the Headset protocol, which is designed for telephony rather than music. You can hear when it switches Bluetooth modes with a short series of beeps. If you want to maintain high quality audio while also using the microphone, set your computer's audio out to the transmitter, and use Bluetooth as the audio input, as in the diagram below:<br /><br />PC &#60;-- BT &#60;-- PX51<br />PC --&#62; RCA/Optical cable --&#62; Xmitter --&#62; PX51<br /><br />## Analog cable<br />Although the PX51 can work without the transmitter or Bluetooth, via a 4-conductor 1/8&#34;-3/32&#34; analog cable, consider this a last resort. The sound quality using this cable is horrible, similar to a telephone.<br /><br />I do not have any game consoles, so I could not test the XBox chat cable.<br /><br />## Close range performance<br />I found that at close range, less than about 10ft, the included transmitter gave me the best experience. It allows for finer customizations in the headphone DSP, and had no dropped samples that I could detect.<br /><br />Bluetooth A2DP with my MacBook Pro and my iPhone 6 very occasionally dropped a sample, audible as a tiny click. It’s not as good as the base station at close range, but read on.<br /><br />## Long range performance<br />Moving about 20ft away and putting several walls in between turned the tables in Bluetooth's favor. It dropped more samples as expected, but it recovered in milliseconds. I got every word in my conversations, and didn't miss a beat in my music.<br /><br />The included transmitter, though, would drop out completely for seconds at a time. To reconnect, I had to wait too long once I was back in reliable range.<br /><br />In a nutshell, use the transmitter if you’re close, and use Bluetooth if you’re far.<br /><br /># Convenience<br />Now is a good time to sing the praises of wirelessness. Before, I had an extension cord on my M40fs, and I was always worrying about twisting it and rolling over it with my chair. No more! Such freedom! I love it!<br /><br />## Phone calls<br />The Bluetooth cell phone pairing works excellently. After I paired it with my iPhone, I just pressed a button on the headphones and answered the call without touching my phone at all! No more worrying about fishing it from your pocket or purse! To hang up, just press the button again.<br /><br />Stop for a moment. I didn't have to take off my headphones at all! The music automatically muted. When the call was done, the microphone muted again and my music was back. Is this... heaven?<br /><br />Close, but not quite.<br /><br />## Chat<br />Other buttons controlled the volume of the Bluetooth signal. Unfortunately, there are beeps for audible feedback for Bluetooth, which interferes a little with the music. They were pretty short though, too short to miss any beats.<br /><br />There is also a 0-delay microphone monitor circuit. The volume control for this is on the front of the left earcup. You can mute the mike with a button on the right earcup, which is a little strange, but OK. When the mike is un-muted, you hear rising beeps, and when it's muted, you hear falling beeps. During this time, other audio is blocked, so you might miss a word in the conversation or a bit of music.<br /><br />## Main (game) audio controls<br />While we're talking about volume, the PX51 also gives me a volume control behind on the left earcup for the signal from the included transmitter. Since this pot is not in the audio path, but instead is connected to the processor, there are no scraping noises and pops. If you move it really fast, you'll get a tiny click or two, but that's it. It won't get in the way of your audio.<br /><br />Other buttons on the left earcup switch between DSP profiles. There is a dedicated button to switch to the &#34;Main profile&#34; and others to switch to the 16 (!!) chat and game profiles, which are customizable in Windows. You can make profiles to focus on action, on voice, to compress the volume levels, and much more. As I mentioned above, I prefer sound true to the recording, so I chose game preset 1 and chat preset 1 for flat, unaltered frequency response.<br /><br /># Audio quality<br />The comments from here on were made using an optical link to the included transmitter from my MacBook Pro.<br /><br />If I listened carefully to some orchestral music, I could tell that the bass was slightly quieter on the PX51s than on the ATH-M40fs. Treble was very slightly clearer. The ATH headphones are actually known to be a little bass-heavy, so this result on the PX51 is actually pretty good. I actually started noticing the subtle clicking of the keys on the clarinets and oboes. This was a pleasant surprise, since most games are heavy on explosions and bass, and my biggest worry was that gaming cans would be super bass-heavy. Instead, I found the PX51 to respond better to high frequencies, or as audiophiles say, the cans were &#34;analytical&#34;.<br /><br />## Equalizer<br />Still, I felt the bass was somewhat lacking in the cellos and timpani. So, I went to Parallels (no Mac version for the Advanced Sound Editor) and opened the ASE to put in some manual bass boost. I set a linear ramp in the equalizer from +0 to +3dB starting from 220Hz down to 20Hz. This let the bass section ring out nicely without being too muddy and overdriven. Note that to get the most granualar control over the DSP, you must use the transmitter and not Bluetooth, even if you use A2DP. You do have a 5-band equalizer for Bluetooth audio, but the transmitter gives you 12 frequency bands to play with.<br /><br />## White noise<br />I noticed a very small amount of white noise, independent of the headphone's volume setting. It was similar in volume to the white noise coming from the headphone output on my Kenwood VR-6050 surround receiver (speaker outputs are great, but they scrimped on the headphone out). I noticed this because I've created my own headphone amplifier, which has no audible white noise background. It's easy to forget about the white noise and just enjoy the music though. Most people probably won't care, but I'm picky.<br /><br />## LF sine waves<br />After this listening test, I tried playing LF sine waves. I found that the response below 25Hz is nonexistent. Sound first comes in at 25Hz, quiet, but definite. 30Hz is clearly audible, but 35Hz really booms out, causing unpleasant mechanical clipping. After that, the sound quiets down until by 50Hz, the volume is normal again. This was a pretty grueling test, and does not reflect real usage. However, the lack of response in the ultra LF band is disappointing to me. These frequencies add a lot of richness to classical music, and I think that when people describe headphones has having &#34;tight bass,&#34; they are talking about this frequency band, from ~25-30Hz down into the subsonic range. Still, a lot of people can only hear sounds down to about 35Hz, so this may not be a big deal for them. In fact, that is probably why the cans roar like that at 35Hz; I'm guessing that the guys at Turtle Beach who designed and calibrated the phones wanted all frequencies to be clear down to the limit of their hearing, so they boosted the bass at this point. Good for others, but not so good for me.<br /><br />(When I tested my hearing, I found that I can clearly hear/feel frequencies down to at least 10Hz and can barely detect 20,000Hz. The lower limit is more because of my equipment than because of my senses. 10Hz is like a deep throb which I feel more than hear, and I begin to sense it more as a sound at 15Hz or so.  20kHz feels like a constant pressure on my ears, rather than a sound. Still, I can clearly tell when the sound is faded in an out. HF begins to feel more like sound at about 19kHz.)<br /><br />## Stereo imaging<br />Although the PX51s have some of the frequency characteristics of more open cans, probably due to the small openings between the buttons, I found that the M40fs gave better stereo imaging. This was tested using the Virtual Barbershop. It was harder to tell whether something was behind or in front of me with the PX51, and sounds that were supposed to be right in my ear sounded a few inches away. The M40fs did better, imaging the sounds within two inches of my ears on the sides and clearly differentiating between front and back. Things in front and back also had a better sense of distance than on the PX51, where I couldn't tell how far away sounds were unless they were towards my right or left.<br /><br />I tried using the surround modes, but I concluded that these were designed for gaming and not for music. It felt like they moved the sound further in front of me, which was probably to compensate for the lack of front-back depth I noticed earlier. Unfortunately for classical music, this also moved the echoes from the back of the concert hall forward, and it sounded like I was listening to the concert from another room. This had the effect of making the music flatter and less immersive, even distorting it, as if it was playing through a corridor. The surround modes probably work better for simpler game soundscapes where you need to locate an enemy sniper, and small bands in acoustically-dead recording studios, but these don't match my use case and I didn't test them. I think it would have been better to start off with better acoustics, instead of band-aiding it with software processing.<br /><br /># Indicators<br />## Power<br />As long as the headphones are on, the power button on the left ear flashes blue. I find this rather annoying, and I wish there was a way to turn this off.<br /><br />On the base station, there is a steady blue LED for power.<br /><br />## Charge<br />There is a red charge LED next to the USB mini (not micro) port on the bottom of the right earcup. This turns off once charged. I'd prefer it if this were in a place more visible, since when this is on the stand, the light is invisible.<br /><br />## Link<br />On the right earcup, there is a small blue/red LED to indicate the audio source. When connected to the transmitter, it is steady blue, and when connected via Bluetooth, it is magenta (both the red and the blue sections are on).<br /><br />The base station also has a blue link light, showing whether it detects digital audio on its optical input. Another blue light turns on if the optical signal is Dolby Digital surround.<br /><br /># Conclusion<br />The PX51 is a great wireless headset. Music on them is enjoyable, and that is the most important thing.<br /><br />I have some complaints. The bright, flashing blue lights on both earcups were overkill in my opinion, and would have been better served with dimmer lights or a more subtle breathing light pattern. The white noise issue could become a headache later, so I hope this is fixed in the next revision. Cutting out everything below 25Hz is also a big problem for the audiophile crowd. I'm sure gamers would appreciate fixes for these too.<br />They got a bunch of things right. I love that they have optical audio in! Way to go! Simultaneous Bluetooth connections to your console and your phone is awesome. Turtle Beach chose good, balanced drivers that don't overdrive the bass.<br /><br />I'm putting their sticker on my laptop. I'm very impressed by the software features and built-in DSP. But this is icing on the cake. The cake itself is to get better drivers and ear cups from the outset, instead of fixing it afterwards with software. To be clear, the acoustics are good, just not excellent. The PX51 does not overdrive the bass like everyone else, which I applaud Turtle Beach for. But that's not permission to chop out the LFE (Low Frequency Effects). The oblong soundstage is also a serious flaw, even for gaming. Post-processing helps this, but it's a band-aid.<br /><br />In the end, I think this is worth four stars. Convenience is very good, but not perfect, and the audio is pretty good for gaming headphones, but not quite audiophile grade. All in all though, I can recommend it for most listeners who want a wireless headset.e a big deal for them.

I just want to watch a hockey game, but I made the mistake of getting this game for my sons, and I can't get my TV back!<br /><br />Seriously, most Kinect games are fun for a little while, but then the novelty wears off, and they go back on the shelf. Not this one. It came in the mail yesterday, and my sons (age 11 and 13) and their friend started in with it right away. Now its all they want to play. The game guides you through a huge variety of dance moves to go with the equally large variety of songs. There's everything from Katy Perry to Ghostbusters (which is the best song to dance with, even Slimer gets in the act). The Kinect easily sees all three players and reacts with more accuracy than any other Kinect game we own (it works with four players, but our living room doesn't). It even gives karaoke points if you sing along! If ever there were a party in a box, this is it.<br /><br />Now, if you can just tell me how to get my TV back. The Islanders are about to play the Penguins...	2015-08-24

However, online reviews are fair, maybe a bit on the harsh side. It is a short game. No way should you spend $60 or $100 on this game (depending on the edition). It's ending felt more like a halfway point to me. The combat could use some fine tuning, but overall not bad. Huge potential for a sequel, however. Not enough emphasis on the supernatural which I hope is addressed in a sequel. Overall the presentation is wonderful (5/5), lackluster gameplay (3/5). Buy used or wait until sequel (if there is one).	2015-08-24

I might not show up as a &#34;verified purchase,&#34; since it has been a while. I purchased one of these about a year ago, then another from the same company a few months ago. Guess why I'm on here writing this review? Yep, because the second one I purchased blew up. This is a bad (and very dangerous) product. See below for each experience:<br /><br />Purchase One: Bought the adapter, and it began to overheat a few months later. We learned that we could watch two shows then we needed to turn it off or it would be shot for a day. After a few months of that, we were watching a show and heard a huge popping sound, then saw a small amount of smoke come out of the adapter box. I unscrewed the box (desperate to finish my episode of x-files) to discover that the cheap electrolytic capacitor they had used in the box was only rated for 25V, something that even a first-year engineering student would have laughed at. The cap had physically blown up inside the box. Not good.<br /><br />Purchase Two - Same deal with overheating. Clearly a really bad product. All the same, it's almost impossible to purchase a real one of these anywhere, so we kept using it until we found a genuine one. Within a few months, the x-box will not even turn on; instead, the red warning light just comes on when plugged in.<br /><br />On both models, I looked at the circuit boards inside. They were the cheapest of the cheap horrible manufacturing, look like they were hand soldered in a sweatshop. See picture for the horrible construction and for a look at the cheap inside of this product.	2015-08-24

The developers failed to deliver a game that out-shone it's predecessor in terms of actual game play, so that even it's outstanding features are rendered useless because after you've built the houses and created the Sims, you are locked into a linear, goal-oriented play style that obviously appeals to some people, but not to me. The open-world, sandbox standard that was set with The Sims 3 was tossed out the window in favor of regimented game play and pretty graphics. I've been playing Sims since 2000 and have reasonable expectations for future installations, but Sims 4 fell woefully short of all of them.	2015-08-24

Granted, candy bars are generally pretty low on my list of things to buy at the grocery store, but that’s not relevant to story. So, I never buy Butterfinger bars. I haven’t in well over a decade. But Hershey or Mars or whoever makes Butterfingers came out with bags of bite-sized Butterfinger pieces. I don’t buy them very often, but relative to less than once a decade I buy them pretty frequently. I’ll have three or four small pieces of Butterfingers, enjoy them, put the bag away and remember I have it sometime later. What I do buy with probably too much frequency is beer. Ales, shandies, stouts, that new craft brew that doesn’t really look that great but I figure I haven’t tried it yet. Butterfingers and Beer are two different types of purchases with the same basic premise, they’re bad for me but I enjoy them to varying degrees.   Helldivers Super-Earth Edition can be a different type of game depending on how you approach it. The game is broken up into bite-sized levels that can take a couple minutes or longer, but aren’t a huge time commitment. On the flipside there are numerous levels, a larger war that acts as a metagame and a lot of unlockables that take a while to unlock.   I’ll be upfront in admitting two things. One, I never played Helldivers prior to the Super-Earth edition. Second, I’m fairly twin stick shooter agnostic. I played through Dead Nation and enjoyed it, but when I was done I was done. Never went back. Halo Spartan Assault was ok but I didn’t finish it which is fairly rare for me. Twin stick shooters are fine, I don’t seek them out but I don’t avoid them like some genres. They are, if you will, candy bars to me. Nice once in a while. Helldivers caters to that with the bite-sized levels. I can burn through one or two and move on with my life. No long playing sessions are required, which is nice. I can pick it up and put it back down fairly quickly and if I’m away from it for a while it only takes a few seconds to get my feel for it again.   On the flipside of that are the beer like aspects of Helldivers. There’s a large war effort going on that completing goals helps move forward by earning influence. There are numerous unlocks to be had and experience is somewhat stingy meaning leveling up is fairly slow. And there are a large number of missions and varied environments to try. The selection of things to do in the game is both broad and deep.   The game plays as a fairly normal twin stick shooter. You are in charge of one soldier that you view from a top down perspective. You move with one stick, aim with the other and fire. There are grenades and secondary items called stratagems that you call down to aid you in your fight. Things like mechs to pilot, turrets, additional weapons, airstrikes, stuff like that. Once on planet you work to complete objectives before being able to extract. You can either play solo, with a group or play in public matchmaking games. Playing solo you have auto-deploys where you are deployed again if you die and if you play in groups it’s up to other group members to save you.   The game has a very tongue in cheek feel to it with cartoon-ish graphics, over the top recruitment propaganda and writing that makes you not take the game so seriously. It helps make a game about death and destruction feel bright and somewhat cheery. The graphics aren’t spectacular, and what little voice acting there is is about average. But the game looks good stylistically. It reminded me of the somewhat cartoony style of Diablo 3.   Co-op definitely makes the game more fun, but that requires having a group of people to play with consistently. If you have that, great, but if you want to play alone, as I have most of the time, the game works fine playing solo. Public match-making can be a bit frustrating as the screen makes it so everyone must be on the screen at one time so if you’re playing with others online and they want to go west andyou want to go east you both end up stuck in the middle running into the edge of the screen. It’s a game that works better alone or coordinating with people you can speak with.   Part of the game’s niche is its difficulty. Much like the Dark Souls series the difficulty is overblown. As long as you’re cognizant of what’s going on and keep track of what munitions you have left it’s not difficult unless you end up getting swarmed from all directions which can happen. The biggest challenge comes from the friendly fire. Resource drops can crush you, fellow teammates can shoot you, your extraction shuttle can kill you, your own turrets can harm you. Everything can hurt everything else, which let’s be fair is what would really happen.   Helldivers Super Earth Edition is a game with a high floor. What I mean by that is that it is generically appealing. Not in being generic but in that it can offer the bite-sized play style for someone like myself who wants to play once in a while for a little while with little commitment. But it also has the deep offerings for someone who wants to get into the game. Someone could invest a lot of time into Helldivers and make it their go to game. It could be bite-sized Butterfingers or Beer depending on what you want to make it.   If you don’t like twin stick shooters then obviously Helldivers isn’t a game for you. Or if you’re looking for a casual game you can zone out and just play it wouldn’t work out so well since it requires a lot of attention. But Helldivers is a high-floor type of affair from my perspective. It’s set up to be played casually if you want, or you can get really involved in it. The Super Earth edition includes all the DLC previously released along with the main game, so new classes and weapons. If you already own the base game it’d be cheaper to just buy the DLC, so this may not be the most economical purchase but if you want the disc version with all DLC it’s a decent game that can fit what you’re looking for.	2015-08-24

The addition of different types of street-style events, particularly the futsal tournaments, gives the game a much more international feel as you work your way up to the top with your squad.  The fact that your players get capped with development points around the level 50 mark also means some strategy is required in building the squad, including your main player/team captain.  It's a bit more FIFA proper and a bit less street oriented in terms of play at times (skill moves aside), but overall is a decent footie game that breaks up the feel of doing the same thing all the time.	2015-08-24

It's hard to recommend the FragFX Shark in any condition or model. My model arrived only a bit used in the mouse button pads.<br />Plugging it in was a cinch. To the Xbox 360, I hooked in my GameStop model wired 360 controller, turned the system on, and from there, it seemed to function well enough, with the d-pad, stick, and mouse all doing as they were labeled to.<br />In games, it's necessary to set the sensitivity much higher than standard, and work from there. I found that in all of the games I tried, managing between in-game sensitivity and the physical sense dial on the FragChuck worked out poorly. The dial seems to manage just how the mouse will handle acceleration more than anything. I found it was best to leave it at zero and work with the sensitivity in-game, and even then, it was never perfect.<br />Controlling games is also a bit harder compared to normal, as there are face button features you are having to do on the mouse. As well as that, the pair is strange with mapping. It makes sense from a controller standpoint, as LB and LT are on the FragChuck, normally in your left hand, while the mouse handles RT and RB on the pads. However, shooters don't work that way unless you are religious to Modern Warfare 3 on the Nintendo Wii, so you'll need to remap the buttons, which has its own trials and trivialization to overcome.<br />The dongle offers a PC mode, however, which makes the pair work as a keyboard and mouse verbatim. For the mouse, it's quite nice to have up to 4 buttons to work with extra, and the mouse wheel even has a Back and Forward button (MB4 and 5 traditionally) mapped to the sides. The mouse, then, totals to 10 distinct buttons with the included Start button. Bare in mind that besides the Back and Forward buttons, they map to keyboard keys, which is negative in the sense that you'll be using the keyboard realistically, but it also allows some games to map to the mouse, incidentally, especially on PC titles like Syndicate, where extra mouse buttons can't be mapped.<br />The FragChuck is also the center to the additions, as rapid fire and setting macros require the FragChuck exclusively. With the widespread complaints of the FragChuck being unable to resync to the dongle, a lot of this sort of detracts from the potential &#34;good&#34; points.<br /><br />Still, it's a nice device hat I use for a couple games, and if I decided to learn how, I would probably switch from my Mazer Type-R mouse to the FragFX Shark fully. As it stands, though, I have a full QWERTY keyboard, and if I want to have a smaller size solution to it, I'd be better to buy a game pad like a Razer Orbweaver.<br />Buy it if you're patient when it comes to mastering hardware and have a setup that is optimal for PC gaming and can accommodate an Xbox 360 well.buttons can't be mapped.<br />The FragChuck is also the center to the additions, as rapid fire and setting macros require the FragChuck exclusively.

My screen would go dark every time I tried to boot my Mac drive. Spent a few days surfing the web and help forums to no avail. Even purchased a portable hard drive to back up my desktop files via Disk Utility intending to reformat, but 2 hours in it would give me an error message so I could not back up all my existing files.<br /><br />Short of hiring an expensive technician, I didn't know what else I could do except give DiskWarrior a try. Couple days to ship, but within 20 minutes of booting it up with USB key, I was delighted to see my Mac back up and running!	2015-08-24

I wasn't disappointed! Ultimate MK3 on the Saturn delivers in virtually all aspects, and is a great home port true to the original. In fact, it is the only one. Although Ultimate MK3 was ported to the Super Nintendo and the Genesis, they are very different games and are actually watered down versions of MK Trilogy, rather than a faithful port of this title. Not to mention the 16-bit consoles don't have the graphic horsepower to deliver like the Saturn does. In my opinion, this game is what Mortal Kombat 3 should have been. More fighters, more secrets, more stages, more finishing moves, it really has it all! Raiden is missing from this one, but it is related to the story line, as Raiden was not in the original MK3 either. UMK3 on the Saturn delivers fast paced, arcade quality action with every move and finisher you'd expect.<br /><br />With all of the greatness that is this port there are some shortcomings, leading to my one star deduction. Firstly, there doesn't appear to be a way to save your menu settings. 9 of 10 fighting games on the Saturn allow you to save your scores and menu settings, but this feature appears to be absent from this port. Its not a huge issue, but is just a minor annoyance causing you to make your selections over and over again each time you reboot the console. That aside, the main issue is the load times. They are fairly frequent, long and somewhat annoying. The worst part is when you're going to do a fatality, the game has to pause and load right in the middle of it! It really affects the flow of the fatality and I've had guests over who thought the game froze and was in error. I feel like Midway could have avoided this by allowing this game to make use of the 1MB or 4MB RAM expansion carts for the Saturn. Unfortunately, this game doesn't utilize those. Another reason Midway should have made use of the RAM expansion would be to bump up the resolution. While the graphics are quite acceptable, the resolution is pretty low and we've all seen the Saturn do better.<br /><br />Even with the load times, lack of option save and sub-par resolution, this game is a solid port with all of the goodies from the arcade version. If you want to play Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 at home, this really is the only way to go!the graphics are quite acceptable, the resolution is pretty low and we've all seen the Saturn do better.   Even with the load times, lack of option save and sub-par resolution, this game is a solid port with all of the goodies from the arcade version.

(I own Black Ops for the WII and DS).  Call of Duty Black Ops was pretty fun to play online.  Me and one of my friends would sit down and have some EPIC CTF (Capture the Flag) battles online.  Then we would do Zombies.  Call of Duty Black Ops is based in the Cold War so the maps are going to be in Veitnam and Cuba.  My favorite perk in Second Chance/Last Stand.  Call of Duty Black Ops ll kicks butt!  Online is fun, but lots of different weapon attachments making it harder or worse than Black Ops.  We tend to do local fighting bots with one of my other friends.  We play on CTF and make it so the flag can't be returned.  Then we put it in the middle of the map and we jump off of a ledge or something and do a 360 spin w/snipers and try to either no-scope (not looking through the scope, but killing the guy) or quick-scope (looking through the scope, but shooting and not looking through the scope to and killing the guy.). And some times we do FFA (Free for all) and snipe each other.  Or we do the most comom (for both games) TDM (Team Deathmatch).  These are the best CALL OF DUTYes yet!	2015-08-24

It will hold 4 games comfortably, but if you try to put any games in the mesh pocket on the lid - they fall out every time I unzip the case.  Would NOT recommend.	2015-08-24

Firstly the thumb stick is both better and worse than the original design. It uses a metal pin to reinforce the core of the thumb stick so it doesn't get loose, but the plastic thumb stick slides of the pin on occasion which is frustrating when playing smash Bros.  Secondly the controller seems to have issues with input lag on repetitive actions, such as smash attack chaining in smash Bros. Other than those 2 things it works perfectly and seems much more durable than the original controller design.	2015-08-24

I'm really happy that we purchased this PS3 500GB when our old PS3 80GB finally gave out. (Blinking red light). We considered getting the PS4, but we use our system mainly for DVD/BD, Plex, and Netflix, with minimal gaming, so we couldn't justify the extra cost. Besides, we love the DVD/BD remote for the PS3 rather than using the game controller for the movies.<br />As for the &#34;Destiny bundle&#34;, I'm truely enjoying playing again!! I haven't enjoyed a game this much since I gave away my XBox 360 with Halo, or the Ratchet & Clank games which I absolutely enjoyed playing for way too many hours. Destiny has much of what I loved about Halo plus the seemingly endless upgrades like in Ratchet.<br />In a nutshell, this PS3 500GB is awesome! Its more streamlined than our old PS3 and all my controllers are compatible!<br />Also, the Destiny bundle is a GREAT choice if you enjoy first person shooter games without all the blood and guts of some of the other titles, but still want all the great gameplay they offer. I'm looking forward to future &#34;Destiny&#34; releases. Keep up the great work Bungie and Sony.	2015-08-24

It's not as broken as some other people said, but only once have I have been able to use it by plugging it in and using it.  Most of the time it takes a dozen or so unplugging/plugging in attempts to get it to work properly.  When it does though, it looks solid - definitely better than a standard connection.<br /><br />It's just such a bummer that you need to buy a converter for today's TV's to get it to work, making this essentially a $60-75 investment (at minimum).  Is this worth buying?  Well, unless you're willing to import some cables - which I haven't tried yet - then yes, otherwise you may end up saving yourself some frustration by purchasing a more expensive cable elsewhere if there is less work in getting those working consistently.	2015-08-24

I finished this game in pretty good time and then ending was fantastic. The FF games are my all time favorite games to play and the first to of the 13 trilogy were great but I did enjoy the change in the battle style from a turn based system they did a really good job and I am really excited for any more new FF series that will come out like the 7 remake and the 15 game that is coming out soon. Despite being rushed and doing little exploring I still give this game a 5/5 for the enjoyment I got playing it.	2015-08-24

This is climbing my list of favorite games of this generation, and is close to taking the #1 slot.  Yes, it is more fun with a few friends, but I've also had a great time playing it with random people.  It's just a matter of whether you are a sociable player and take the initiative to talk on your mic.  I equate playing Evolve to going to the bball courts by yourself or with one or two friends and getting into a pick up game of basketball.  Open the lines of communication, meet new people, and have a blast hunting down the monster.  Almost every round I've ever played is fun and super intense.<br /><br />Bottom line, the gameplay, graphics, variety of hunters and monsters, and thought put into the cooperative play are in a league of their own in my opinion and I can not recommend this game enough.  I really wish more people would give it a try and not be so quick to bash it based on one or two rounds because it may just be the most underrated game of this generation.<br /><br />Now...who wants to go hunting?

The only time an online account should be required is when one wants to play online!! Get a clue EA!!	2015-08-24

His best friend has this headset and after trying it out at his house, my son has been wanting one for months! There is a volume control dial on the back of the headset for adjusting the relative volume of chat and game, which is helpful; you can adjust it while wearing the headset. The mic is extendable or retractable; retracting it makes it less likely that the mic will get damaged when not in use. There is also an optional audio cord to plug into other devices such as a CD player or computer.<br /><br />The headset really immerses you in the game and effectively blocks most outside sound. He loves the eerie green glow. The fact that it's wireless makes such a difference. So far so good!	2015-08-24

I've never seen such great detective mechanisms before. At first it seems like you are just gathering clues, but the real magic unfolds when you get to piece them together. There are multiple possible solutions, all plausible, and you have to live with your deduction without knowing if it was correct (there is a &#34;tell me the answer option at the end of each mystery, but I haven't used it). The correct solution requires attention to detail and real logic skills, and one of them I agonized over for quite some time...	2015-08-24

Does not have a mute switch like the US version of the PS4 mic.  The whole reason I bought this was to have a mute switch option, which this product does not have.  UPDATE:  Okay so there is a mute switch, but it a button built-into the mic bar itself, and you have to hold it down to mute.  You cannot play a game and hold the mute down the entire time, basically defeating the purpose of having a mute option anyway.  Needs to be an off/on switch, not &#34;hold-to-mute&#34;!  Still 2/5 stars because mute feature is useless, but it still works as a basic mic replacement.	2015-08-24

I like it a lot.<br /><br />The Wii u console seems to have been a worthwhile purchase. I recommend to others.<br /><br />My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the digital copy of the game.

As soon as I got it and hooked everything up, the power supply didn't work so I couldn't even turn it on.

I got his new controller because my previous one (came with the PS4) has started to get some wear on it and the right analog stick is acting up. It seems like the thumbsticks on PS4 controller are getting a bad rap these days. Mine started to wear down and my left stick ended up getting some cracks in the material. The right stick has some hardware issues. It doesn't get its full range of motion anymore. If I hold it in any direction it'll only get about half of its original motion. Still works fine but it can be annoying for first person shooters. As for the new controller, it's completely the same, just different color. If I remember, I'll update this review in a few months and see if the wear is similar to my original controller.	2015-08-24

I wanted to replace the top and bottom shell parts and re-use the rest of the buttons from my busted controller, but the size of the cutouts/slots in the shell are ever-so-slightly different, such that the OEM parts from Microsoft will not fit seamlessly in it.  For example, the start/select buttons don't fit all the way in, the top RB/LB guard piece leaves gaps with the OEM RB/LB buttons, and the OEM RB/LB buttons leave gaps with the top and bottom shell when you try to reuse them in the new case.<br /><br /> Also, the OEM clear acrylic sleeve for the guide button LED does not fit in the central hole in this shell, which is a shame because the sleeve that is shipped with the kit doesn't have the little black strips built into it.  The end result is that when the controller number indicator LED is lit, the light sort of disperses all the way around the ring rather than being cleanly limited to one quadrant of the ring.<br /><br />All in all, these are fairly small gripes, and I just ended up using all the new shell parts with the old circuit board and triggers.  If you just need to replace a cracked/broken shell, this kit will do it for not a lot of money.	2015-08-24

After managing to lose the stylus for my 3DS XL (old version) on a plane, I was unable to play some games effectively.

I wasn't sure if the retractable aspect would be a factor, but I have actually found it to be pretty handy and convenient as I am playing games where I have to draw out maps (e.g. Persona Q). The extra length makes it easier to grip to complete the mapping.<br /><br />For the price, I think these are pretty wonderful and I would recommend it for anyone requiring a replacement stylus.	2015-08-24

Wait about 20 seconds after ALL lights on the Xbox one are off THEN restart the Xbox.  After the unit has FULLY restarted take the external unit and plug in the included USB extension cable to the external and plug the other end into the USB connection on the Xbox ( the one the external is gonna plug into).  At this point just follow the on-screen guide and you are in business..  I would recommend getting the same drive I did as I am not sure if others will have comparability problems.  Hope that help someone and have a wonderful day.	2015-08-24

I have grown tired in the post-COD4:MW era of first-person shooters because I haven't found any COD game, or most FPS's related to it, worthwhile. The Battlefield series has been decent, and for me Destiny is really the only FPS over the past 7-8 years that I found truly worth the price tag (I am not a Halo fan). But Far Cry 4 combines above average FPS gameplay with a unique game environment, unpredictable open-world experiences, and a story that will keep you interested. This is something along the lines of Tomb Raider meets GTA for me, as the open-world of Kyrat, the fictional Himalayan setting of the game, is lush with environments full of enemies, diverse types of missions, and wild animals that will surprise the heck out of you when they attack. I haven't ventured into the online multiplayer much because I have been quite enamored with the story mode, but I'll provide an update once I venture into it.<br /><br />As for the story, it has an Uncharted feel to it: American protagonist ventures into an exotic land and fights a ton of villains. The protagonist, Ajay, is not that interesting himself but his comrade's and their enemies are very interesting characters. Also, the journey he is on is one of self-discovery, as Kyrat is the homeland of his late parents, and as their story unfolds, the game becomes more and more interesting. As with most open-world games nowadays, there is the main campaign and a plethora of side missions, all which seem to provide over 30 hours of fresh gameplay. This is the first Far Cry game I have ever played, so if fans of the series are used to the quality of gaming provided in Far Cry 4, I feel a bit foolish for missing out all this time. One of the things that I enjoy most are the variety of weapons present in the game (everything from a bow with flaming arrows to a bazooka). If you haven't explored this game yet, there's no reason not to buy it now that itis basically priced as a Greatest Hits title.	2015-08-24

I seat on my couch on varies positions for several hours and it never felt uncomfortable wearing. the mic is really good malleable. My friends had no trouble at all hearing me. The function that feed my voice into the headset is really good to healp me not shout. Specially when my wife is sleeping and I'm playing with my friends. I haven't played with the presets to much yet, so no input here. The battery life is great for a extreme gamer like me and it charges relatively quick. It's extremely comfortable on the ears and head(I wear glasses and this is a problem for me with some headsets). The outside noise isolation and the bass coming from gunfire are really good.<br />The minor negative points: It's a loud, but not a ear-splitting loud headset. If you are into glass-shattering loud death metal, this headset might feel a little underwhelming for you. There is a minor delay associated with the process of converting electrical input to wireless signal to audio again. It's a 0.1 or 0.2 seconds delay. Only noticeable if you got the TV and the Headset on at the same time. All and all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.	2015-08-24

They did a very good job of bringing up to date the old Xcom games. Xcom: Enemy Unknown is a good remake of the originals. Xcom: Enemy Within brings in some nice additions to the game. What detracts are some game design decisions that are a bit frustrating, such as times when you do not have sight on an enemy but he shoots you anyway, or you can't shoot through a wall but they do and injure or kill one of your team. You can upgrade your original interceptors by not your landing craft to bring your team in. Your team members start out with ridiculously low stats. Really? You have this exception type of war all of a sudden forced upon you and you go in with a rookie team? Not Delta Force, not Rangers, not Seals, but rookies. I understand your not having the equal to their weapons, armor and such in the beginning and the need to research and develop to try and catch up, but rookies who can't hit the broadside of barn, really?<br />Even later when your team is well developed you can have the house size alien mech coming at you and you have a 90% or better chance to hit from you best people and they can't hit it. Right.<br />So saves are important because the game is designed to cheat in definite favor to the aliens no matter how late in the game it is.<br />But don't misunderstand the game is to quit good and enjoyable otherwise.	2015-08-24

This game is a good game that is still being played as a free to play RPG MMO you do get bonuses with the actual game purchase and it is worth it. I had played when the game first came out and loved it for a long time. I tend to move around in my gaming and I have revisited RIFT on many occasions so I do like the game itself.<br /><br />It is a bit darker for those that do not like all the colorful fluff in most games of this genre right now and for the price and F2P it is certainly worth picking up.	2015-08-24

Sensitivity hasn't dropped and the glide is smooth. The optical red light also dims when you remove it from whatever surface you are using this mouse on, conserving some energy. The mouse lights will remain ON even when your laptop is in SLEEP mode since the USB ports are still powered. The blue light under the scroll wheel looks nice as does the red light line that runs down between the right and left clicker, but the blue lights pictured in the listing isn't as impressively bright as it is in real life. It is dim even in a dark room. Not really an issue; mostly just an aesthetics gripe. The programmable buttons on the left side of the mouse are preprogrammed to go back or forwards on browser pages which I haven't changed because I do a lot of web surfing. Good mouse, but don't buy it if you are expecting sharp light effects.	2015-08-24

I've played every entry in the series and they are all great in their own way. Even the worst Halo is better then the majority of its competition on the market. The master chief collection is the ultimate Halo fan tribute to a franchise that almost never disappoints. Now I will say that I play Halo more for the story then for the multiplayer, so my review doesn't really factor in any continuing multiplayer issues. If you're looking for the entire series playable in 1080p at 60fps, then you've come to the right place. My one major gripe is that Halo: Reach isn't in this collection. I realize that it's not part of the mainline Master Chief tale, but it's an excellent game that truely captures the desperation humanity felt when the covenant juggernaut destroyed Reach and leads directly into Halo: CE. Overall a great package.	2015-08-24
