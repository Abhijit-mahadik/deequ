These are the only shoes I have found with great arch support. I worked on my feet all day and these have never failed me. I found out exactly how much support they have. I wore a different pair of sneaker for about 4-5 hours - I had to go do some yard work so I put on my ones and I was just amazed at that there was more support in my 2 yr old K-Swiss than my new one (different brand). In the store you don't feel it just trying it for a minute but when you actually wear the others and then change into these, it's like night and day. All they currently sell now from K-Swiss are memory foam. I am not a fan of memory foam but I loved these shoes so I did buy the ones with memory foam, took them home, wore them for 3-4 hours around the house and had cramps in the ball (where toes connect to foot) of my feet and toes. Took them off - took them back - came home found these and ordered them and they are what it says fit just like always. I need to order more!	2015-08-07

First off, let me tell you about the company you are buying from. These are no nonsense, friendly as can be, great to deal with, simply put, awesome people. This is a company that will stand behind their product, period. I won't sugarcoat my experience, I wear a size 11 1/2 shoe with room for thicker socks during the winter, which in Texas isn't really much of one. So, with my special education of deduction, courtesy of The United States Army, I ordered a size 12.<br /><br />Faster than you know what through a goose, my Combat Flipflops arrive, and I rip open the box, why rip it open, because I'm a guy and we open boxes like a ten year old during Christmas. My hands are shaking, I'm breaking into a sweat, waiting to slip these puppies on (not actual puppies, it's a euphemism dummy). Oh no, I done screwed the pooch (another euphemism, it's a military thing, you wouldn't understand), they are just a bit too small. (never heard that one before ;-) ). I start to panic, and then I realize that I ordered from a company that is owned by people whose lineage can be traced back to Colonial America, beat that Apple™.<br /><br />I contact Combat Flipflops, and proudly admitted my mistake, I was obviously longer than I thought I was (my feet were, get your mind out of the gutter). I was told in some strange Alpha-Numeric language: &#34;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&#34;, you must be a &#34;Foxtrot November Golf&#34;? No problem, &#34;we got your 6&#34;, we'll ship you a size 13 while you find us some &#34;grid squares&#34;. Get some &#34;rack time&#34;, and then check &#34;mail call&#34; in a few days for your new Combat Flipflops in the &#34;right&#34; size. Please place your return in the provided box, and use the provided prepaid shipping label to send it back to us. This is how you do business, this is how you earn repeat business, and this is how you earn a great reputation.<br /><br />I'll briefly describe the quality of the 2014 AR-15 Combat Flipflops I received. The bottom can only be described as comparable to a set of Pirelli™ 335/30 ZR20 tires used on a Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4™, but will most certainly last longer, and are adorned with a rather unique bouquet pattern :-). The midsole(s) are constructed of EVA™ cushioned closed cell foam, and the top deck uses only premium Bovine leather, which ensure the utmost comfort during day or night leisurely activities. The toe straps ride perfectly on the foot, so you don't suffer from a case of the slips should your foot perspire, never let them see you sweat. Finally, the package is adorned with the omnipotent 5.56mm casing (cast). In other words, they are the Testoni™ of casual summer wear. For those that might deem the price a bit steep for flipflops (cough, cheapskates), consider the fact that this might very well be the last pair of flipflops you ever need to buy. So, you can continue to throw Jackson's ($20.00 dollar bills for you neophytes) away, year after year, or you buy once, and cry once. I'm out, Audi 5000. hnnnnnnnnnnngn only be described as comparable to a set of Pirelli™ 335/30 ZR20 tires used on a Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4™, but will most certainly last longer, and are adorned with a rather unique bouquet pattern :-).

Since I purchased these shoes, I took them on a test walk through the streets of Barcelona, the trails along the cliffs of Cassis, the half-day trek through the halls of the Vatican Museum and Rom, and the serpentine roads from Naples to Sorrento.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I have never worn a more comfortable pair of shoes.<br /><br />I think I tried them out on every surface, and trail type, that I could; aside from ice. I didn't feel like I was ever about to lose my footing or didn't have a good grip. My ankle always had a good amount of support as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy on, easy off.<br />+ Good looking (matter of personal preference, but I got compliments).<br />+ Relatively easy to clean, for a shoe.<br />+ Confidence in each step I took.<br />+ Comfortable. I forgot I had them on most of the time. No soreness in my feet at the end of the day (legs are another issue).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- If this turns out to be user error, I will update my review. It is the only reason they aren't 5 stars. After I cinch up the laces there is no place for the &#34;extra&#34; to go... I tried tucking it under the laces towards the toe, but there was still a bit hanging off. I tried pulling it over the toe, bringing it under the shoe so that it was &#34;around my ankle.&#34; That just seemed silly and didn't feel good. In the end I just loosened up all the laces so that the excess vanished. It wasn't as snug of a fit, but there wasn't a lot of movement, so it still worked well.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Great shoe for active guys. Stood up to a fairly good field test and I didn't see any signs of excess wear and tear. Comfortable as all get out.	2015-08-07

I swear they have a truck waiting around the corner when I order something. So I am 6'4&#34; tall at 220 lbs and have been blessed with flat feet due to being born into a defective gene pool, and on top of that I have  bunions which make the toe area a bit wider requiring me to buy 2E width shoes and boots. I was pleasantly surprised when I had the opportunity to purchase these boots and see that they were offered in the 2E availability. I jumped all over that order as is most of the time I only see boots offered in the &#34;D&#34; width size. Well when I got the boots I was impressed with their quality at first look. They fit pretty well. With one pair of socks I normally wear a size 11.5- 2E These were spot on. The extra wide 2E was just a tiny bit tight but acceptable and as the boots were brand new  the leather or material  would loosen and relax over time. Had I ordered the 3E, they might have ended up being too loose. So this was the right pair and size to order, at least for me. I wore them for hours the first day and they were very comfortable to say the least. I could feel the slightest distress as I wore them, but that is the process you go through during &#34;the breaking in period&#34;..No biggie, certainly not a deal breaker.<br />Now for the pros and cons of the boots:<br />Pros: Great quality, appearance, fit, material, sole style...Everything good<br />Con: There is only one problem that I have and here it is. I have been wearing boots pretty much my entire life and that is a lot of years to a sum of about I don't know? a hundred pair of boots. It has been my experience  over the years that the best eyelets that can be used on a boot period are the ones that swivel and are a round or triangle shape metal loop which causes very, very, little abrasion to the shoe laces as they are pulled on to snug up. The style also does not act like a knife or sharp edge and cut the laces during the period that the boots are worn as they worn and rubbing back and forth. The only change I would make to these boots If I was in charge of boot design at Cat or any other boot builder would be to change the eyelet style from the current quick wrap over style which have a tendency to cut laces due to their sharp edges and change to a full loop style, which the laces last forever it seems. Other than that buy these boots they are Great. If it was not for the undesirable eyelets I would have given these boots a five star rating, maybe a 6 star if it was available, but the eyelets make it a one star deduction..	2015-08-07

The picture can't do them justice. Just incredible to behold. The spikes on the heel make them unbelievably edgy. I'm a normal Women's 12 so I sized up like everyone suggested and I am so glad I did; I have much more room in the toe box with the 13 so I'm betting that will give me longer wear-time. Also, I'm 6'1&#34; and 260 lbs, so I was worried the boot would be too narrow in the calf. I was wrong. After lacing them up and buckling them to the right fit, the top of the shaft fits beautifully around even the biggest part of my calf, which is 17.5&#34; . Don't worry about loosening the laces as much as you need. There's no running out of lace...it's EXTRA long. TRUST ME. Also, the buckles have plenty of holes to be adjusted, and there is extra room on the end of the flaps if you needed to poke an extra hole...or three. The quality of the boot is pleasantly shocking. Excellent quality. Nice leather, not thin. Good, solid zipper. The steel heel is completely strong and I feel very secure walking in them - no wobbliness. Very heavy (but probably just because I bought a size 13 as opposed to an 8, obviously...) I have never purchased anything like this in my life. I'm not exactly the girl who perused Hot Topic growing up, but these are just a little something I got for myself and MAN am I impressed. I laced them up and stood in front of the mirror and it LITERALLY took my breath away. I cannot WAIT to surprise the boyfriend with these tonight!!!!	2015-08-07

I've tried a lot of desperate measures to get the nasty smell out of my running shoes, and these are the only things that seem to have worked. They smell fresh and don't &#34;mask&#34; the stink so much as to actually replace the bad smells with good smells. What I like most about these is that they are easy for travel because you can take them with you in a carry on, compared to sprays or attempting to wash shoes and drying them. My husband and I brought these on our honeymoon where we did a lot of walking in the heat, and it probably saved us from having extremely awful smelling shoes/suitcases.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase these in the future.	2015-08-07

I like the pair. they are very stylish. Very light. I would not wear them to run though. The front of the shoes puts pressure on my toes nail form the top, which is interesting because they are neither small not narrow. It is just the design. So when I ran, it did not feel comfortable. I am gonna continue using my old pair of shoes to run. But for other sports, they are juts fine. For example, I played squash yesterday for 40 min. I was comfortable, did not feel any pain or pressure anywhere on my feet.	2015-08-07

I have a wider foot, so this was one of the few options out there that came in wide width.  I was initially annoyed with the way they work because they seemed very difficult to work, but as soon as you know you just have to pull up on the knob to loosen them, they work like a dream.  They run extremely small.  I usually wear a 9 1/2 and I ordered a 43 E (the largest size available) based on other reviews, and they fit perfectly.  Thanks to the other reviewers for the size warning.  The reflector is very easy to velcro, and the yellow panels are breathable.  Overall - if you can find a size that fits - these are great cycling shoes.	2015-08-07

Donna	I LOVE these shoes.  I have been wearing them inside and outside in the garden, and I never have to change them for another shoe because they remain comfortable for a long time.  I also think they are nice-looking and that I can, and do, wear them lots of places<br /><br />The ONE problem I have is that today I noticed a hole in the toe of one shoe.  Yikes!  It's little but no doubt will grow bigger, as holes in fabrics tend to do.  And having a hole in my shoe will greatly limit where I will wear them.<br /><br />The thing is, I don't think canvas should have a hole in it when I've had these shoes for two months.  The bottom of the shoe is fine, the laces are even still pretty clean, and the shoes are not falling apart - except for the hole.  I am trying to decide whether to just wear them out.	2015-08-07

Always careful when ordering shoes from Amazon as I am in Australia and returning them is a massive hassle AND expensive. As soon as I opened the box I was in love. The quality and detail are out of this world and they smell amazing. Closed in shoes are tricky for me as I can either be a 9 or 9.5, depending on the make. Reviews said they run true to size although the 9.5 I ordered is a tiny bit large. Not enough for me to return them though, I will just wear thicker socks.  These boots, this brand, are seriously first class. I feel pretty spesh in them :)	2015-08-07

I returned it.  The cross body strap is on the thin side, so I think it would really dig into your shoulder, especially if you filled up this large purse.  I also don't like the silvr feet on the bottom, because they are apparent while holding the purse, and make it look more like luggage.  I prefer a softer structure bag than this.  It also stunk.  I'm glad I ordered through Amazon so return was easy.  I have read the reviews on several heshe bags, and it seems that they gave some purses away in exchange for reviews.  If I had received this bag for free, I would be thrilled and leave 5 stars too, because it is nice quality.  But, for my money, I'd rather have something else.	2015-08-07

How is it possible that my very hard to fit feet found perfection in an online purchase?  I really wanted some comfortable, stylish, RED boots that had a slight heel that would still be easy to walk in and comfortable.  I got the very last pair of these in my size.  When they arrived, the actual boot box was beat all to pieces, but the boots were beautiful and undamaged.  I wore them for 5 hours on my feet at my daughter's birthday party.  Sure, my feet were sore afterwards, but not damaged the way some shoes will do.  All they need is a thin insole, and the long term comfort would be addressed.  I receive multiple compliments on these, followed by &#34;where did you find them?&#34; and then jaw dropping silence as I state I bought them online!  They are lined on the inside and will be quite comfy this winter.  If possible, I'd buy another 3 pair!  And what an awesome price!  $25 plus 10 for shipping and handling - $35 total.  For great quality!  I make jewelry, and I plan to make a sparkly crystal anklet for the left boot.  I have a lovely red dress that they match perfectly.  What a head turner that combination has been! If they have any left in your size, GRAB THEM!!!  Thank you Very Volatile and Shoe Girl!	2015-08-07

They are so &#34;springy&#34; and have lots of cushion. I'm on my feet al day in healthcare and these have met my needs. However this is the first time I've ever bought a lace up from them and I usually buy the typical slip on clog. When I bought the Mirage Mule Lace Up, I purchased the same size as I do in my other Klogs, and it was HUGE. It fit as though they sent me a wide size or perhaps made this wide by mistake, and the heel cup was very loose. I sent them back, purchased a new pair but a half size smaller and now the length is fine but still the Mirage Mule (medium width) fits like a wide. So I'm sending them back. Now I know why they were on sale.  :-(  I'm still going to buy the brand because of the comfort but will stick with the other styles that have fit in the past.  Shouldn't have messed with a good thing!!	2015-08-07

I put 4 note books in there with a folder and a small handful of papers on the inside along with my charger on the inside pocket (there is two / and there is a side zipper on the inside as well) On the out side I could put a regular sized water bottle in each but having all that stuff in it and trying to close it shut didnt work along with the zipper not zipping. The stuff I did not mind at all. The zipper on the outside back would always open because of it rubbing on me so I never used it. But if you are a light carry then this would be a 5 star having alot of things in the bag makes problems of course.<br /><br />After about 7 months of use with all the school stuff in it the strap attached to it gently ripped in half and on of the magnets to hold the fold shut came off	2015-08-07

He has an injured leg from a car accident years ago. A bone in his foot was crushed and he has screws in his ankle. He lives with hip/leg/ankle pain and being on his feet for so many hours really takes a toll.  I first bought him a pair of these for Christmas last year from an outlet by our house. He loved them for work. They helped with his pain and made work a lot more bearable. His leg recently started hurting bad enough to start having to wear crutches. We figured that after 6 months, his shoes were probably worn out. I bought him another pair from Amazon and sure enough! Once he started wearing the new pair he felt instant relief. He describes these shoes as unbelievably comfortable and the shoes that have made the biggest difference in relieving his every day pain. They did wear out after 6 months, but that was after being worn 5 days a week for over 12 hours a day. I'd say they definitely outlasted their worth. Once my husband's current pair wear out, I'll be buying more.	2015-08-07

I normally wear a 10.5 in almost all other Adidas but this model is really small. Most likely due to the upward toe box design, I had to go to 11.5, and because 10.5 and 11 was small. 12 is actually what I needed because I was planning on running with these, but they didn't have them. After a few minutes of jogging,  these are just too small to run alot, swelling purposes, but exceptionally comfortable.  So I'll just add these to my casual collection of 20+ shoes.	2015-08-07

I absolutely love my Skechers Go Walk 3 Fitknit shoes as well as the several other pairs of Skecher shoes and sneakers that I own.  They provide extreme comfort for my feet and they have a wonderful cushion feel on the ground.  They are all my go to shoes and sneakers whenever I am going to be on my feet all day at places such as Universal Studios, Disney World, Seaworld, etc.  They are light, and they breathe well in the intense summer heat in Florida.  The only thing to note is that they run a bit small compared to other brands that I have owned.  For instance, I also wear Converse Chuck Taylor All Star High Tops.  I always buy them in men's size 11.  For the same fit in all of the Skechers that I've bought, I've had to buy men's size 12.

Honestly, for the price you pay, they are ok at best (even though I realize $35 is pretty cheap). The Glue that holds most of the shoe together is not very strong and things start falling apart pretty fast. Not to mention the soles are pretty soft which means that they wont last very long if worn often on concrete. I do however love the look of the shoe and they fit quite well.  All in all, if your looking for a shoe to wear once in a while to fit a particular outfit, these would work great. If you are looking for a boat shoe to sport all summer long, Id go with a Sperry Top-Sider or an Original Penguin because even though they are a little more pricy, they will last you much longer than these will.	2015-08-07

The shoe is comfortable and cute, but a little odd in the execution. The toe is a perfect semi-circle, and the irregular sizing of the cutouts is distracting. I could probably live with that, but the peculiar position of the Velcro closure keeps it from being a true slipon. As we all know Velcro losses grip after frequent adjustment and I am afraid that's what would happen with these. So unfortunately I will be sending these back.	2015-08-07

They do what sunglasses are supposed to do. There's no arguing with that. What set these apart from any other sunglasses from a mall kiosk selling cheap phone cases and sunglasses in a 2-for-1 deal? I don't know.  For these sunglasses' regular price of $25, I expected nice, durable metal frames, but it is actually a &#34;resin&#34; frame (read:plastic). That's not entirely a bad thing. It's lighter and does not get bent out of shape like metal frames. I tried bending it a little, and it seems pretty durable for plastic. It also has a nice gloss finish.  On my particular pair of sunglasses, I had a small hairline scratch on the right side. It's not a big deal. I'll still be using these sunglasses regardless, but I feel this should be mentioned per quality control standards.  These sunglasses came well packed and comes with a neat little carrying bag. As in the product description, these are unisex and will look decent on any human wearing them. They look like those black shades that the stereotypical fbi agent wears in movies.  4/5 stars - I like it. If not for my disdain of the price and little scratch, this product would have 5/5 stars. However, these shades are worth a glance when shopping for some low cost polarized sunglasses.  disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.	2015-08-07

I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE BOOTIES, I BOUGHT 3 PAIR LAST YEAR FROM MY LOCAL CLOTHING STORE .... THEY FIT AS EXPECTED, LOVE THE CHUNCKY HEEL TO GIVE ME ALOT OF SUPPORT. I HAVE THE BROWN, NATURAL AND BLACK LEATHER PAIRS. THEY GO GREAT WITH JEANS OR SKIRTS. THE HEEL HEIGHT IS OK, THEY ARE 4.25 INCHES BUT IT DOESNT FEEL LIKE IT, I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW U MEASURE IT.... BUT DEF A GREAT ITEM!!!!!	2015-08-07
US	44986492	R7CZ4L8GU3CPX	B005F2SYKG	722232857	Reef Women's Sandy Sandal	Shoes	5	0	0	N	Y	Comfortable	These are super comfy flip flops.  I wear them all day long and even in the river.  They are wide enough for my feet and thick enough that you can't feel rocks.  I am a true 8 and they fit great, if you can wear an 8.5, you will need a nine for sure as there is only a little room at the heel.  The wide band is soft and I had no issue breaking these in.  They also have not squished down too far like some flops do.  I love Reef flip flops and these are great.	2015-08-07

We are very familiar with the brand as he has worn them since he was 5. He has hard to fit feet, and these are the only brand of atletic shoes that he has ever been happy with. For clarification, his feet are wide with a high instep. The shoes are also very flexible and he can wiggle his toes in the toe box which is important. I wish they ade this same model in larger sizes, would make my life a lot easier!	2015-08-07

The lenses scratch if they touch anything and both sides have started to separate from the frame. This is my first time with Ray-Ban and my last. In all fairness, I have dropped these glasses twice which has resulted in chips and scratches to the lenses. However, the glasses fell from around 3 feet, as I was bending over. So, in my opinion, and from owning Oakley products, these scratch/chip way too easily.	2015-08-07

The adjustable straps give them a custom fit. The rubberized footbed is textured to prevent slipping, and plenty wide (if you have narrow feet, these may be floppy on you - I usually wear an E or C/D, so the width is just great for me). The magnet is incredibly strong, so no problems with the clasp coming undone. The color and raised relief details make for a very cute and unique shoe (the purple roses are especially darling). The shoe base is a sort of rubbery plastic, the straps are neoprene, while the molded details are solid plastic. The only problem is with the synthetic footbed accumulating sweat and dirt, especially in the relief details. To keep odor in check, you will need to wash these often, but since they're synthetic, you can simply run a hose over them.	2015-08-07

Wore them all day without any problems.  I gave the product 4 stars because they straps do not allow for much adjustment.  The buckles are attached to the leather with elastic and the straps are sewn down so I could not tighten enough to have straps securely across my feet.  However, even though I had lots of wiggle room, there was no slipping or sliding sideways.  I just prefer the straps more snug. I will take them to my shoemaker and see what he can do.  Also 4 stars because I think the price is too steep for the construction of this shoe.  That said, the shoe bed fits perfectly in length and width, soft touch on the ground but still a bit of that Dansko rocker action and a nice arch. I do recommend these shoes with caveats above.  I love the sparkly color - gold with flecks of other colors.  Feminine and almost sturdy enough. If I can get the straps across the instep and top of foot (and I do have a high arch) to fit more snuggly they'll be perfect.	2015-08-07

These shoes are definitely more stiffer than the last pair of running shoes I owned. However, I think this is to add more support. The shoe is extremely comfortable and provides enough support that you could potentially wear it all day. The shoe is very well made and the colors on the shoe outstanding. It's true that they're a bit more brighter than the ones in the picture, but I think it makes them look much better. I definitely recommend these shoes to anyone is just starting out running or someone who is more advance, you will not be disappointed in them!	2015-08-07

Like everyone says they run very tight especially toe box.  With that said this is my 3rd pair 2 are indoor and all size 12 which I wear in Puma and Adidas. The key is to properly stretch them, they are worth the effort or buy a size up  Heat them with blow dryer, stuff with paper and hammer that in, as much as possible, heat more but be careful. Also wear heavy socks and wet the socks and shoes and walk around or kick the ball for 29/minutes , use shoe trees and benpatient. It took about 5+ times and a few games and trust me they fit like a glove. I think it was worth the effort I have a tin of shoes and find these the bbeat. Beat support, cushioning, super light and great traction on grass and turf. Puma Kings, Adidas Modial, Nike Lunar Gati are all good but heavy and the Bikes last a month or they did for.me. Asics shoes and cleats are worth a try and up with the best of them. FYI, tried the new Puma turf shoes which are leather and they are cheap.all around, sent back The Asic soccer cleats Dx light kangeroo run true to size which surprised me	2015-08-07

First, the fit is a little tight so you can only wear thin socks, even if you have black socks with padding will not work. I bought my normal size and I have to loosen the laces fully to get my foot in, a shoe horn might come in handy. I don't want to get a larger size since the shoe tip is on the long side and make walking a little awkward. Second, make sure you have the leather conditioner/restoration and shoe care kit with brown polish. The shoes crack easily and I had one that was almost an inch thick which made the shoe look less than appealing until I used the conditioner and kit. These shoes will need regular maintenance.	2015-08-07

Wore them on a 5 hour hike and zip line trip and they never felt like they were going to slip off my feet or rubbed blisters.  The shoes were a little wide on my foot, but nothing that was overly noticeable. Wore them with light socks one day and the fit was fine.  A bit high priced, but a great shoe.	2015-08-07

The fabric on the insoles have bare spots and the heel on one is torn. But the shoes have held up well for the cost. I don't have a habit of taking good care of my shoes and I normally only own one pair. So these have been abused and are only just ready for replacement after a year. Not bad at all.  -original review- I have fairly wide feet. I measure Men's 10 4E when given enough room for wiggle. However I can rarely find 4E wide shoes in the stores so I normally go with a 10.5 2E or 11 2E which is still perfectly comfortable if just a tad loose. Since you can never be too sure about what one manufacturer's 4E is going to be compared to another buying shoes online has always been a risk for me. I was pleasantly surprised when these shoes arrived and they matched my measurements exactly. A perfect fit!  This shoe is very tall with a thick cushiony insert. Very comfortable.	2015-08-07

But these are very, very cute and both girls insist on wearing them if they even see them.  These are somewhat difficult to put on a child under 2- the shaft part of the boot is pretty narrow near the shoe part, so you have to get the child to point her feet to put them on.  The kids typically wear them on short walks and outings- we don't try them for the play time (eg. park) since they can't run all that well in them.	2015-08-07

Pay attention COs	I read a lot of reviews on a lot of different boots. The reviews for these boots from other COs helped me a lot. I read some reviews that stated that these had an initial period that had discomfort while breaking them in. I was wearing these with dress socks, and never had a problem. The zipper works great and means I only had to tie them once, which was great. These are light as well, barely weigh anymore than the dress shoes I wore during orientation. Basically, these boots fit my needs, along with being comfortable for long shift on my feet. I will update and I wear these longer, but this first week has been nice, with no sore spots. Feet stay dry, and I can wear them all day.	2015-08-07

These were the ONLY shoes that were comfortable and still pretty.  Pricey yes, but my whites have lasted two summers of heavy use and are still cute and holding strong.  The other two, purchased this year after great experience with last summer.  Can walk at fairs, concerts, carnivals and shopping. Can wear out to dinner though too...

My feet felt wrapped in comfort from the moment I tucked my toes into their slots.  I have been walking on asphalt as well as dirt paths and both types of walking/hiking feel good.  There is a little more sole cushion then other 5 finger styles which I appreciate when hiking. I did buy a size 43 instead of a 42 to give my feet a little room when they begin to sweat and swell after several hours of hiking.  I have problems with my toes, crossing over and hammer toes so these shoes allow me to hike without blistering them which is a blessing.	2015-08-07

It was perfect.  Wore out 3 pairs of them.  I was devastated when they were discontinued.  I searched far and wide on the internet with no luck.  Wasted money on 4 other brands and styles, but ended up throwing them away.  I avoided this sandal because it had a back strap, unlike my slides.  I gave in, bought a pair of these, and I wore them all day the first day, and they felt like a comfortable pair of house slippers.  If I lost these today, I would immediately buy another pair.  I highly recommend them if you liked the Columbia Slate Slide.	2015-08-07

I was so excited when I received this bag... I had already had it picked out what lucky wardrobe I was going to promote this bag with.<br /><br />When it finally arrived, I had it down to the count that I would transfer my belongings from my current purse, & be on my way!<br /><br />When I completed my goal, I went out in public with the confidence that my bag, my wardrobe would set the scene, & Immediately when I walked across the street, the new bag of purchase &#34;Broke&#34;!  (Doom, Doom, Doom)...<br /><br />The handles where the chains are connected popped... I immediately picked up the remnants, & was saddened by the ordeal.<br /><br />Ok, so never fail, a woman has to do, what a woman has to do..., &#34;Repair&#34; it the homemade old fashioned way.<br /><br />Take out the hot glue gun, & secure the straps, so no more faulty disruptions.  When all else fails, they broke again. (Ugh!)<br /><br />Now this purse has become a catch all underneath my desk @ work, needingly to say, that the bag broke on the street near my work.<br /><br />I had high hopes, & high expectations when this bag was going to arrive.  Non the less, it hasn't gone completely Hopeless, it just remains underneath my desk @ work, to put nick nacks in ( primarily utilized as storage) for its usage.<br /><br />Oh, well, the world isn't over..., I ended up buying another bag, not quite like this one.

My sister sent me a link to this shoe as a suggestion for my bridesmaids and as soon as I saw it I loved it. I initially went and tried it on only to be able to give my bridesmaids details about the fit, height, and comfort but I fell in love with it. The online photos don't do it justice.<br /><br />When a few of my bridesmaids felt they would not be comfortable with the heel height, I decided that it would be perfect for me. They are cut slightly small so I ordered a half size larger than my normal size and the fit is perfect.<br /><br />The price of this shoe at retail stores fluctuated between $89. and $119. so being able to purchase them on Amazon for $56. was a major bonus especially since the other wedding shoes that I was finding were almost triple that price.<br /><br />The only negative about this shoe is that the rhinestones are glued to a strip and that strip is glued to the shoe. My first pair arrived with a few rhinestones missing from the front of the shoe and it seems like those rhinestones may have come off during shipping because I found them in the bottom of the box.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon is amazing at returns so I returned that pair and purchased a new pair - I didn't do an exchange because the shoe price had dropped again to $46. and I wanted to benefit from additional savings. My new pair is exquisite and will add just the right amount of sparkle and glamor to my dress.	2015-08-07

The suede footbed is nice and the straps are backed by padded neoprene, which makes them very comfortable. Because of the placement of the toe separator, my foot is forced farther back on the footbed than I would like. My heel is very near the back, while there is about an inch of space in front of my toes. This causes the minimal arch support on these flops to not line up correctly with my foot.	2015-08-07

Maybe its just me, but I found that you need to wear tube socks with these by default. Otherwise right on the back of your ankle, there is a sharp ridge that cuts your ankle as you walk. Hurts man. But put on some nice longer socks and they feel great. Definitely good for walking through snow and water below the laces. Keeps nice and dry as well as warm. Only reason I deduct a star is because of the whole needing to wear longer sock, but then again I'm more of a lowcut sock guy so maybe everyone else just already wears longer socks.	2015-08-07

Closest these came in my size was 9-10.  82% of reviewers claimed these &#34;fit as expected&#34;.  Hard to believe!<br />Looked like a real nice slipper out of the box.  However, could hardly get my foot all the way in.  Back they went.  Did not re-order in larger size because next size up was a 10.5-11.5 which probably would have been too large.  From reading other reviews of slippers it appears that as to size, find one that is no more than 1/2 larger and 1/2 smaller than your true size.  Wound up finding a similar slipper in size 9.5-10.5 that fit very well.  After all, you want to be comfortable in these.  Too tight is not good and a little too large results in your heel lifting out of the slipper.	2015-08-07

All Out Charge: For an active person with flat narrow feet I am often hesitant to purchase any footwear that has not been tried on. However, having an old used pair of Merrell's which fit great made me more open to doing so. This is a quality shoe that provides arch & ankle support that you often can't find with the average sneaker. Usually I have to wrap my ankle to get the full support that I need. With this shoe I do not. Very happy with Merrell! Not buying any other brand.	2015-08-07

Very light weight, but seem very sturdy.  Nice tread for outdoor work.  However, they fit very large.  They seem a little long, but the much larger issue for me, is that they are very wide.  I've never needed a special width shoe, so I'd say my foot is rather &#34;normal.&#34;  But when I put these on, and tightened them as much as I could, my foot still moved, mostly toward the front.  I could also completely lift my toes off the bottom, so the toe box is very large.  Again, other than the fit, they seem like an amazing buy at $66 for the quality!	2015-08-07

I love these.They are comfortable and I work in a fast pace environment. Also, When you are reading the sizes. It is always better to go up a size or just a half. Since I had only going up a half. These are made in and sold my the United Kingdom.. When it comes to buying shoes or  sandals. Knowing your size is very helpful.  I'm so glad I didn't sent them back. they were just a little snug..But never hurt my feet and feel sturdy. I wear thin socks.

I bought the other color first and loved it so wanted 2 pairs of a great shoe. This red one fit totally different than the white turquoise one. White one very comfy, this one was narrower and shorter in toe box and seams rubbed unlike the other pair. I usually wear an 8 wide, but in this shoe ordered an 8.5 wide in both colors, but only the white ones fit and felt very comfy with Dr Scholls comfort fit insoles (cf420).<br /><br />Update...After returning the too small red ones, I bought another pair of the white with turquoise ones and Thank God they fit like the original pair I bought in the same color...very cushy and comfy and I have very flat feet and wear insoles in them...no need to remove the inside of the shoe, just put the insole on top of the one the shoe comes with. One other thing with this shoe is if you feel the support is reducing, try tightening up the laces on the shoe from top to bottom. It helped me... I have tried 2 different New Balance sneakers and neither of them we're this comfortable even with insoles.<br />Hope this helps you, dear reader...<br />UPDATE...Had to give both pairs away as after wearing a few weeks developed sesamoiditis in my left foot from these...basically started to have pain in lowest bog toe joint and into ball of foot where the toe connects. Ruled out other conditions and it was unfortunately these sneakers...when I went to try on other sneakers for overpronation, Brooks also caused trouble in the same place... I am now wearing asics gel sneakers instead...they work with my orthotics and don't cause that pain. I hope they last and don't hurt me too!	2015-08-07

Cute.  High enough for little lift but don't feel like I'm wearing heels - but - there is virtually no arch support and these definitely don't fit the category of a &#34;comfort&#34; shoe as one would expect from Clarks.  The insoles are not padded so feel quite firm, hard on the ball of the foot.  Not for walking other than to get from here to there.  The soles are very flexible which is the only thing that makes wearing them for a few hours possible.  The laces are also a good thing, makes them easy to get into and comfortable from that standpoint.  If the price had not been greatly reduced I would have returned.  With arch support and a more cushioned footbed these would be great. If you are under 40 and have &#34;unwornout&#34;, flatter feet these will probably work for you.	2015-08-07

I purchased these after seeing them in a Clark's retail store in the mall. Immediately when they arrived, I could tell they were not the same. The Beeswax coloring was very uneven with several dark spot marks around the boot. The back of the boot was significantly lighter than the rest. Just looking at them, you can see the manufacturing[[ASIN:B000WU8SBQ Clarks Originals Men's Desert Boot,Beeswax,10 M US]] was extremely poor. Uneven cuts, awful coloring, and very noticeable scratches and marks. It fit very uncomfortably and nothing like the originals from the store.<br /><br />Just to confirm for myself, I brought these boots to my closest Clark's retail store and compared them side by side. What a difference! These look like such a cheap knockoff. They have the Clark's logo but that's about it. The originals fit much better and comfortably.<br /><br />If you really like these boots, dish out the extra bucks for the originals. They will hold up nicely over time and you will be satisfied.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for selling such poor quality product.	2015-08-07

However, he doesn't always want to pay the cost.  He was stunned when he found out the cost of the boot when he got the first pair but he couldn't have me return them as he'd worn them already.  After a few weeks of compliments, great traction and relief from back and foot fatigue, he conceded that quality over quantity is the win win solution even if you have to spend a bit more.  The Tim - Pro typically last 14 - 18 months depending on what type of work he's done, with the most damage being to the sole where it may start to crack/crease a bit.  Overall, its a fantastic boot and since the price has dropped it's an even better deal for the same quality!	2015-08-07

Did not purchase through Amazon, but love these so much I wanted to write a review anyway. We were in WA state, on the Dungeness Spit, and I was wearing these sandals thinking we were just going to wander around on the beach a little. We ended up hiking the 11-mile round trip to the lighthouse and back. I have low back problems and am usually careful about hiking shoes but I suffered NO ILL EFFECTS from doing an 11-mile beach hike in these. Great arch support, great back support. I'm usually a Merrell girl but I love these sandals. (I have the black/gray). The only problem with my sudden hiking decision was a Teva-tan from being in the sun all day. Haha.

I rarely have anything else on my feet. They are comfortable for all day wear and really hug your arch. However, I don't suggest wearing them to an amusement park on the day you get them.... First day wear, all day at the park, gave birth to many blisters on the soles of my feet. There are some raised lines that cushion the ends of your toes (where they meet your foot) for support and grip... this is where I blistered badly. Just and FYI for anyone who isn't smart enough (like me) to break them in first before an all day use lol. I know several people who've bought these after seeing mine and they all love theirs too.	2015-08-07

And btw - would never purchase from this seller (Morgan Miller) again - even though item states &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; - small print states that some size/color combinations aren't.

I love the Livie and Luca shoes however in the description it does not clarify what type of sole the shoe has. This will make a difference in the LIVIE and LUCA sizing chart. Please visit the website of Livie and Luca before ordering, especially if you have ordered their shoes in the past. I thought I had ordered the exact same thing from last year in a different size until it didn't fit. According to LIVIE and LUCA website, the sole will change the size! I ordered what is called a STRIKER sole on it last year and it runs big so I knew she was in a 12 last year, she would fit a 13 now. Nope. The sole is different making this shoe feel like a 12. (this is a TRAC sole) Now I have to return 2 pairs of shoes and search for a STRIKER sole. I will add, that if you can get the right fit for your child, you will not regret buying these shoes. The sole is rubber, almost no skid and the elementary schools love them. She can still wear them on gym days if she wanted and climb monkey  bars safely. They are very durable. My first time buying was last year and when I get done, we will have owned 6 pairs of these. They are great in winter with printed warm tights, dressed up with a short laced sock or even barefoot.	2015-08-07

The first pair of trail running shoes (not Salomon, a traditional hiking shoe), I lost 2 toenails and had black and blue big toenails and blisters.  I then spent about 2 hours at REI picking out these bad boys. The Salomon Women's XR Mission was the perfect fit and performed like a champ on rocky and root terrain.  I did go up a half size as recommended for hikers and all was good with my padded socks.  I have narrow heals and an average width toe box.  However, I have small bunions and fat pinky toes, so this shoe accommodates the need for extra width at the toe box in addition to the give it provides on the side panels. No blisters and no toenail loss-- I am now buying my second pair and yes, I like the funky colors!	2015-08-07

These sandals have gotten me through 9 months of pregnancy and I'm still wearing them. The only complaint I would mention is that they do, as others have commented, smell a little after wearing. However, they are extremely easy to clean and that seems to keep the smell factor under control. I have been very happy and I would purchase them again.	2015-08-07

The shoes are super cute and seem to be comfortable, but they do not withstand the wear and tear of a typical toddler! We have had them less than a month and the front, back and sides of the shoe are completely worn through down to a plain, tan color. The glitter and pink part of the shoe are just worn away. It looks like she's had these about a year. I'm thankful I only paid $15 for them, but even that is too much for lasting less than a month!	2015-08-07

Great shoe, not for everybody but if you are light, like the feel of the contour of your feet with the ground, a mid-foot stride, and no clunky training shoe feel, you will like this.

So far the fit is ok....as with my previous Trotters, which is why I made this purchase.  I was a bit confused with the ordering......picture showed a plain pair of shoes but when you click &#34;black&#34;, a snake-skin type shoe came up so I wasn't sure what I was getting.  Unfortunately, I got the plain version.....the good thing is that, it fits.  As this is my second pair of Trotters, I am more confident of getting a good fit and Trotters is becoming my &#34;go-to&#34; brand but it can be so damn expensive!!!   --------------------  Update on review  Now that I have a chance to wear the shoe, I concur with the other reviewers who said that the heel appears to be big.  I am having the same problem.....shoe is constantly slipping off my feet...size is ok, height of the heel is ok....will have to find some inserts and hope this works.  Very disappointed as my previous Trotters fit so well and is so comfortable.	2015-08-07

I can't believe all the positive reviews on this shoe --- did the others receive a different product than I?<br />First thing I noticed was that the quality looks pretty bad overall.  The leather is hard, brittle, and scratchy on the inside (blister-making material for sure) and the staples in the shoe might be ok for saddles or something but on a shoe it really does look like a fifth grader made it.  I already anticipated this would need a Foot Petal or other insert since the wood surface would probably kill my feet after an hour or so and was as expected from pictures.  I went a full size up as others advised, which was correct, but still overall awkward.  I probably had a half inch of space in the back of the heel but the width of the front fit perfect (any smaller/narrower would be too tight) and the straps connected to the shoe base for the ankle strap were digging in under my foot (again with the hard, scratchy leather.)  Considering the price, I was overwhelmed with disappointment that such a cute shoe went so wrong.	2015-08-07

I love this bag already just a few F.Y.I.s , the long strap isn't that big to be a cross body which I thought it would but oh well it's still long, the zipper on the inside isn't like the one on the outside and it's cheaply made and thin so I'd be careful in case it breaks and it's tiny as well. The inside material is a bit harder which I like because it won't rip or snag so easily on anything you put in there. The bag itself is pretty heavy but that's because of the material it's made out of.I can't wait to use it I already put my stuff in it, it can hold a good amount of stuff, wallet, keys, sunglasses case, small bag of essentials and I still have some room for anything like my iPad mini or a book. Shipping was excellent came way before the date it tells you except I didn't get any notifications like I did on other stuff on when it would be here but oh well it was a nice surprise. It was packaged in a black mailing bag with tissue paper and so it comes in a bit flat but once you put your stuff in it its true shape takes form.	2015-08-07

The design is just a bit different to be well, different and they are not going to be missed on your feet. Like Dorothy.<br /><br /> They are decently made and the thing I really like about them is that they seems to have sewn the inner into the shoe. I like wearing loafers barefoot and within no time the inner has separated and has come loose. I wore these around for a good few hours over two days and they were great out of the ‘bag’ (they come in a pink bag ;)<br /><br />Comfortable and no slipping at all for me which is GREAT as I usually have to wear a shoe in and have had nightmare blisters within minutes of a new pair if I don’t bandaid up. The fit was actually spot on with it maybe being a shade on the small side but I’m talking a fraction. If i went half a size up they might be perfect or they might just be that fraction too big so I would say order your actual size and you should be right and you will get into them. If I was wearing socks I would have ordered the size up but for how I wear them they are fine.<br /><br /> They have a bit of gel spring in the heel and were not tiring like similar flats / skate type shoes rather as I have already stated I find them very comfortable just for casual wearing.<br /><br /> Color is exactly like the description and they took about a week to get her from China which is pretty standard. I really like them, time will tell how they hold up but as a ‘different’ shoe they are on the money for me. I also have an alternate pair which I will run through their paces in the next day or so but they are pretty much identical in build so I would expect good things of them also.<br /><br /> Product provided for review - its just my opinion	2015-08-07

The shoe goes right across the bone instead of dipping below it. So, if you are like me, and that bone gets irritated with height cut shoes, this choice of golf shoe will not be wise.	2015-08-07

I find many Crocs too slippery when wet but these are great for hiking, walking, in the sand, in the rocks...exceptionally light, I love them.<br /><br />  And...as an added bonus, they really are great looking with a long skirt or shorts, capris- whatever!  They're light, sleek- and my Jack Russell-tennis-ball-eater has tried a time or two to eat them- they even held up to his tenacity.  Great shoes, will order again if mine every wear out.

I have had to start wearing Superfeet Insoles as a power walker that walks 6.7 miles 5 days a week. These were recommended by my Podiatrist paired with the insoles they are really helping my overworked falling arches. I love the colors and the room in the toe box. They can easily be adjusted to accommodate wider fit and after taking out the sole included with the shoe replacing it with the Superfeet Insoles there is still ample room for daily adjustments if necessary. My only wish is that they had more grip on the sole for walking on a paved trail.	2015-08-07

Two things though: 1) It is a little wider in width than I expected, I wear medium and this one definitely is wide for my size. 2) Being it already wider, my pinky toenails keeps getting caught/brushed in the lace webbing inside (I have very short nails and no, my feet were not dry, in fact I lathered them with lotion thinking that might solve the issue that maybe my nails are just dry somewhat? But didn't do the trick). Except for these little issues, I love these shoes and will continue wearing them.	2015-08-07

The ankle support is a bit stiff so it gave me a huge painful blister right on my ankle.  Since the blister was directly with bone contact it took more than a week to completely heal.  Even then it was still sore and tender.  It also gave me some sore toes since I was going downhill for some time.  Due to the discomfort following the next week I was unable to give it another test until given time.  After I felt comfortable I wore some thick socks the next time to keep my toes from hurting and also wrapped my ankle where the previous blister had been.  The second time around it was a lot better but it was still a bit stiff around the ankle.  I give it 3 stars just because I have not had it long enough to break them in so I will update as I continue the use of the shoes.  I believe each person is different in many factors (ie: different strides, variations of stepping, weight distributions on feet...etc) so keep in mind of those varying circumstances.	2015-08-07

I recently bought a Tsubo sandals from my favorite shoe store and I loved it but this one, hmmm I don't .<br />First, the color was not as expected, such a dull one and not beautiful at all.<br />Secondly the shoe was made out of cut leather. No hemming was done to the edges of the cut leather. You can actually see the scissor lines. How can a top manufacturer make a brand name shoe like that. This tells me that it's not original Tsubo manufacturer. Be careful what you buy online, it never the same as buying from store.	2015-08-07

When you're on your feet all day you want something that is going to provide comfort, and these sandals brought the comfort and them some. I was a bit concerned because I saw no wide version and I'm normally a 10.5 wide. However when I got these babies they fit like a glove, not tight or pinching, and I felt like I was walking on pillows. Comic Con is murder on your feet and by the day's end you can be begging for death, or at least someone to come and chop off your feet. Past sneakers and sandals I've brought with me gave out and 6 hours in my feet were screaming in agony. However I felt no discomfort with a pair of these Keen sandals, and was able to go on with no trouble.  I'm sure these are great hiking sandals but they're also awesome Comic Con sandals.	2015-08-07

I got these to use around the house and for shot trips up to my mailbox which is up a hill from my place. These fit very well. I got them a bit large as I have very wide feet and if I don't get a 14 or so, they tend to fit tight. These fit really well, and are very comfortable to wear. I like the stretch bands on either side of the slipper that allow for easy getting in and out. Also the heal has a high back that I also like as it keeps the slipper fitting better and your foot doesn't feel like it might slip out of them as sometimes is the case. These are really very comfortable and great looking slippers. A really good buy for me!	2015-08-07

I have worn the Chaco Men's Z1 for about 4 years and have finally worn them out, so I thought I would try the Z2. They just don't work for me. The strap around the toe chafes and because I wear socks with my sandals (it's Portland, Oregon, so...) having the toe loop under my sock wasn't comfortable. I wore them for about 3 hours and decided to return them and get the Z1 again - which I absolutely love. The Z2 is a great sandal for those who never wear socks with their sandals and have calluses on their big toes from similar sandals/thongs, so I'm not putting it down, it is just that it doesn't work for me.	2015-08-07

I could fit an entire finger behind my heel - way too big.  Also the arch was painful when walking, not like the sandals I have which I could wear all day without problems.  On this shoe when my arch tendon flexed, it hit the shoe's arch and hurt.  I could barely walk down the hall in these.  I had to return them, which cost me $14 in shipping fees...hoping to see that refunded when I get my money back (shouldn't be a problem).  They were VERY cute, however, and I really had hoped they would fit right.  My suggestion - find these in a store to try them on for size.	2015-08-07

The heel is exactly 3.5 inches and they came with a complimentary set of heel grips and gel cushions. I was very skeptical about what to expect but I couldn't be happier.

They look a bit clunky, but actually they are not.  I wear these in the snow and ice of the Keweewaw Peninsula and my feet never got cold or wet, even when the temperature was around -20F.<br /><br />They have a cuff around the top of the boot that can seal off any snow from coming inside.  I cannot say for sure how well this works exactly, as I wore snow-pants with them as well, but I had nothing come inside my boots.<br /><br />The laces come with cinches to make sure they stay tight (i.e. you do not tie them).  I was a bit skeptical of this at first, but came around to like this idea.<br /><br />They get good traction on snow, so-so on ice.  I tried to put my Stabl-Icers on the boots, but these boots were too big for the size &#34;large&#34; that fit my regular boots (but I am sure an XL or XXL would fit fine!).<br /><br />I typically wear a 10-EE, so I ordered a 10.

The shoes are fairly comfortable. (I only say 'fairly' because I think a wide width option would be more comfortable for me. But for regular-width feet it'll be perfect.)<br /><br />My issue is the faux socks attached the shoes. Because of the shoe material required to attach the socks to on the inside of the shoe, it's a real challenge getting them on. You kind of have to fight to get your feet into the shoes. I can't imagine travelling in these booties (which was my plan) and being asked at an airport to remove them. It will be an embarrassing struggle on and off.<br /><br />Pity. They're so nice looking but logic flew out the door there. Why put faux socks? We will wear socks with them anyway!	2015-08-07

This is my second pair of Ray Ban folding Wayfarers and I will keep buying them, I'm sure. The first pair I had got a little beaten up after 6 years of nearly daily use. I'm trying to take better care of these. They come in a nice little leatherette case but can also be folded into a pocket in a pinch. From a few feet away they look like standard Wayfarers. But in some ways they're better. The size is perfect for my face. They're polarized. And there are many times when the folding feature means I can stow them without a big, bulky case. If you like the classic Ray Ban style, don't be afraid to try these.	2015-08-07

Unique and comfortable	These shoes look and feel great.  Unique and comfortable.  I've actually received a number of compliments while wearing them.  The one trick to them is how to hide the laces, since you don't want to display them tied on top; this would detract from the style you're hoping to achieve.<br /><br />I attempted to just leave the laces untied and leave them sitting on the bottom of the shoe, so essentially my weight would hold them in place.  This worked somewhat, but after an hour, the shoes would feel loose and need to be adjusted.  You need to tie them underneath the tongue (see attached pic). With this method you actually cannot feel the laces and the shoes stay in firmly in place.	2015-08-07

Purchased in the ice color - a pretty dove gray color. The leather is soft and the footbed is cushioned compared to other Frye sandals. The straps have got me stumped though. The ankle strap barely fits on the last hole and I'm sure in certain angles makes me look like I have ankle rolls because the strap is so tight. The strap across the toes is also snug and I could barely get my toes in when I first got them. I know the soft leather will stretch and conform to my foot like all Frye's do, but the ankle strap won't stretch that much. The footbed is narrow and  I really wish Frye would make a wide option. I have 13 pairs of Frye boots and this is the first sandal I've tried. I'm sure they use the same footbed in their boots and sandals, but if you have any foot overhang at all you can really see it in a narrow sandal. I like the style how it can be dressed up or down, and the soft leather is amazing, just not sure if I'm keeping these or not.	2015-08-07

This review is 5 years post purchase.  I purchased these for a trip to Mount Rainier National Park. Since then i have hiked in them for every vacation that we've taken.  Including climbing Winapichu in Peru.  This summer i took them to the south west and during a hike in White Sands i looked down and noticed that the adhesive on both feet had come undone between the toe and the sole.  It was the first hike of a 2 week trip and as a hard to fit (14W) i was worried that i'd be hiking in sneakers for the rest of the trip.  I ended up getting some adhesive from home depot that worked well enough for me to finish our vacation but i'm now in need of a new pair of boots.<br /><br />I'm on the fence about replacing them with the same pair.  These have been quite comfortable but the way that the sole is mated to the upper gives me some concern.  But the alternatives that i am looking at are almost twice the price.<br /><br />Decisions.	2015-08-07

I'm usually a walking commuter, so I don't wear these unless I'm driving somewhere because they would definitely wear out, but they are comfortable (which is a huge priority to me).

I should have gotten a 9.5, but I don't think anyone notices but me,and the fabric is very soft and forgiving.	2015-08-07

They stayed on in a medium surf, protected the bottoms of my feet while I was climbing up so sun-toasty lava rocks. The yellows ones are nice and bright, making them easy to see on the beach. Now, having said that: rocks and sand immediately gravitated to the inside of the shoes once wet. This was a miserable experience. Then the soles became unglued almost immediately, which made for a slippery or uncomfortable water shoe until I pulled out the soles.  This left behind glue residue which then trapped sand in it and made for gooey sand paper. For the price, its not horrible, but I'd never wear these shoes near sand or gravel again, which has rendered them completely useless. Since the sand and gravel trapped in the glue is bits of coral and lava rock from Hawai'i,  I might incur the wrath of Pele, maybe not worth saving $2...	2015-08-07

The issue I had was that the sizing seemed very off.  I held them up to my other Stacy Adams size 10 slip on shoes and they were nearly an inch longer.  Not sure how that works, but I just returned them since the long toe is not what I was looking for.	2015-08-07

Again, I've left a review already but here it is again - much the same as my review of the other pair that I received - the black suede booties:<br /><br />Just fantastic looking!  A tiny bit western but not cowboy at all.  Great wooden heal and the leather is soft and so comfortable. I wore these the day after I received them to my doctor's office and the nurse had me hooked up to the blood pressure machine, thermometer, pulse-ox machine, and yet the first thing she asked me instead of how I was feeling was, &#34;Oh my Gosh, I love, love, love your boots! Where did you get them and do they have them in a size 10&#34;.  So, safe to say they are eye-catching.  Then, my doctor also said she liked them as well. How many great comments does it take to make a boot a great one - counting mine, that is far more than I needed!!! Love my Bandolinos!	2015-08-07

Although these shoes are cute and pretty comfortable, I have an issue about how cheap the material feels. The black strap that &#34;holds&#34; the shoe doesn't feel durable at all and I have a feeling that these aren't going to last me long. Just know the quality of the material is just ok. If you like shoes that look similar to this and more durable I suggest looking at T.U.K. cat shoes (save up and get them instead)<br /><br />UPDATE: 4 stars went to 2 stars<br />So I've only worn these shoes about twice now, and since then the eyeballs have popped out, there are creases in the shoe and frankly, I am just not impressed with the quality. I stand all day at work, so why by just the second time of wearing they look like I ran a marathon in them? I had to use a sharpie for the eyes that have popped off.	2015-08-07

When attempting to access a weapon through the zippers is difficult because the zippers are too short. If you have a small caliber handgun, you may be able to access with ease. If you want to access your handgun from the top flap of the purse, you have to hold the flap back with one hand, unzip the purse, and still holding open the flap, then you can retrieve the weapon. The flap of the purse does not stay secure because there is only one, almost, quarter-sized magnet sewn in the flap when there should be at three because of the weight of the leather.	2015-08-07

I wanted a pair of Birkenstocks for a very long time and finally decided to make the big purchase. I looked online everywhere to see which website had the best offer for authentic Birkenstocks and decided on the Amazon Birkenstock seller. I usually wear a size 8 or 8.5 US Women's but I tried on a pair of Birkenstocks in store and found that the recommended size 39 EU was about an inch to big so I sized down to a 38 EU with a normal width (M). I opted for the Dark Brown Birko-Flor which is supposed to imitate the look and feel of leather (it does!). These are hands down one of the MOST comfortable sandals I have ever tried and they go with any outfit! Can't wait to wear these for years :)	2015-08-07

Has many pockets and a divider which is amazing. The bag seems high quality for the price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  I purchased the beige color and it is not at all what the color shows online. It looks like a lighter verson of what the caremal looks like online. It's closer to a dark tan. Tha last con is that the shoulder straps are quite short but I don't like the one strap option so i deal with it.<br /><br />Over all this is a very nice bag and seems like it will hold up for quite a while.	2015-08-07

I was able to find them in a Narrow this time and I LOVE them even more.  These are WALKING sandals. Your foot is completely &#34;embraced&#34; and secured; cushioned yet stable.  They weigh next to nothing.  Do note that the velcro straps, while appearing to be adjustable, are really not (maybe a tad - but hardly that). I favor the greystone color; it's really versatile and works well with many colors.  I wear these sandals for all sorts of things -- from grocery shopping and running errands to housework. Well made and long lasting -- my old pair is now my gardening pair.  I'm fond of my frou-frou little summer sandals too, of course, but when I have to be on my feet for hours at a time, I can count of my Clarks.	2015-08-07

My husband ideally wears a 12.5 N(B) shoe.  Having read the previous reviews that these shoes are narrow we thought they would be perfect for him in a 13.  Having tried them on, he's concerned that the toe box is still a bit narrow - even for him.  They do look nice and he likes the easy on/off with the Velcro closure.  The cushioning seems good on a first impression.  He hasn't yet decided if he will keep them because of the narrow toes.  These are definitely not the shoes for anyone who doesn't wear a N(B) shoe.	2015-08-07

Not even 5 minutes into it, I was in serious pain. Rocks were jabbing into the paper thin sole, beating up my feet and the sole inserts kept sliding around and flipping in half. Through the wobbling around on the gravel from the pain, I even strained my Achilles by the end of it all. (I'm 24 and in good shape.) I could've bought a pair from walmart for 1/3 of the price and probably better quality had they been in season. DO NOT buy these if you need them for more terrain than the beach or just getting in and out of water.	2015-08-07

I contacted lems to have them refund or replace the cost of the boots, but because I had tried to waterproof them with beeswax and not the otterwax they sell, they refused to do anything for me. I have read other reviews about these boots that refer to the issue of delamination as well, but thought I'd give them a chance. I would highly discourage anyone from spending so much money on a defective product. I would give these boots no stars if that was an option.	2015-08-07

I do have wide feet, but these are much narrower and generally less comfortable than another pair of the exact same shoes that I own.<br /><br />A while ago I bought these Breckelles flats in black, in the same size (8). I have problem feet, but these were incredibly comfortable once I added gel heel and arch cushions (for support and padding, these have none and I add them to every shoe) and a foam heel pad (to prevent rubbing). Man, I loved those shoes; it's very infrequent that I can find a pointed-toe flat that is wide enough and which accommodates gel inserts. I wore those shoes a few days a week for months. Of course, they're not designed for longevity and they got torn up, so I bought this pair in Leopard as a replacement.<br /><br />The new shoe is much narrower at the ball of the foot; it pinches my bunions horribly, which the earlier pair didn't. The material of this pair feels more stiff, and almost cardboard or paper-like, and the sole is different; it's covered in a felt-like material that comes off as you walk, so that your soles seem to have lint balls on them. I wore them twice and gave them to Goodwill. I don't think I'll take the risk on another pair being similarly narrow. Wide feet, beware.	2015-08-07

These boots really are the lightest boot that Timberland makes, but that's as far as it goes. These boots scuff very easily and the support in them is very disappointing: If you're used to the anti fatigue that Timberland makes don't buy these. My feet are killing me at the end of everyday.

The footbed is nice and squishy, and the fabric bands are soft and stretchy.

Because of the way this is designed the pad does not wrap all the way around the heel of my foot for even pressure distribution and and as a result it will often get uncomfortable at one of the corners of the padding (although I have never had a blister, only redness).  To add insult to injury, just last week the D-ring used for the heel strap broke, so now I can't wear them and they need replaced.	2015-08-07
US	47032403	REZ05NY223IJ4	B00KPU4EA2	392797802	Saucony Men's Mirage 5 Running Shoe	Shoes	5	21	21	N	N	Great balance of features	This shoe hasn't gotten the love it deserves. It nicely balances a minimal, natural feel with cushioning, support, and durability, and it feels comfortable and reasonably fast over lots of miles.<br /><br />I think of it as a hybrid between the last model of this shoe, the Mirage 4, and the ever-popular Kinvara line (particularly the Kinvara 4). Compared to the Mirage 4, this model is a hair more flexible in the sole and the plastic bridge that provides arch support. Both of these are nice improvements because the last model was too stiff, especially the bridge piece, which I found to be painfully hard at times.<br /><br />The Mirage 5 also improves on the Kinvara. I switched from the Kinvara to the Mirage because the added arch support helped me with some high-mileage pronation issues, and I recommend the switch if you like the Kinvara's light, natural feel and want more support. I'm at 400 miles on my current pair, and they still feel quite supportive and responsive. (The Kinvara usually konks out around 400, or even sooner, in my experience.)<br /><br />Overall, the Mirage 5 is a great choice for runners who like a minimal, low heel drop shoe but need or want some support for lots of miles. It's comfortable, responsive, and even looks pretty darn good! I selfishly hope people buy this shoe so that Saucony doesn't scrap it.	2015-08-07

This shoulder bag is right for me in many ways. I like the quality of the leather, color and design. I like to use this bag as an addition color to my style. In this bag, I can put all the necessary things: credit cards, driver's license, passport and lipstick, perfume and so on. The bag has three departments, each secured on zipper lock. I enjoy this bag as much, so I would like to buy the same also in a different color.	2015-08-07

The toe box is too wide for my foot so my toes hurt as well. Also, the pivot point is not slippery, it is the same material as the rest of the sole so it kind of sticks a bit.  They are stylish and beautiful shoes and comfortable to wear around to the grocery store and light exercise things, but in my opinion, not suitable for serious workouts.  The search for the perfect Zumba shoe continues.  My last pair were Nike and they were a little snug but had excellent support and the pivot point was made of rubber so dense it felt like plastic so spinning was a breeze, but I don't seem to be able to find them again; perhaps they aren't being made anymore.	2015-08-07

It might just be a fluke, but I just wanted to make a note of it. I think I'll be able to get it off with the right cleaner (goo be gone). The shoes look great.

I ordered this sandal in the red and immediately fell in love with them when I took them out of the box. However, when I put them on to my disappointment my toes stuck out over the front of the shoe.

I have since ordered another pair in size 9. I have never worn a size 9 so I'm hoping they won't be too big because I really like this sandal.	2015-08-07

A lot of reviews here say it won't fit a 6+ alone or with a case and thats the reason why I was so skeptical. Well I'm glad I took the risk 😁..it definitely fits with a case on (that I also purchase from Amazon as well) I'm only rating this item on the fit..I haven't had a chance to actually go out with it..it does smell kinda funky when you take it out the wrapper it comes in but that's no big deal for me. Here's a picture of the case I purchase with the pouch. Hope this review helps 👍🏽	2015-08-07

These boots definitely live up to my expectations  with quality construction and durability. I can wear these boots all day long and be comfortable the entire time. I also bought a size larger allowing me to wear a thicker sock once the temperature drops but they still fit well enough around the ankle to wear during the hot summer without sweating to death!

(NOTE: I wear a 4E and usually I have to settle for a white, black or gray pair not this time!!)<br /><br />I'm not easily satisfied when it comes to shoe comfort. Even with my daily casual wear, I typically have to supplement most of the shoes I own with gel insoles and/or arch support of some sort. Running shoes not so much, but these even surpass expectation. The only other pair I have owned that compares to the immediate, &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; comfort as these (&#34;ASICS Gel Contend 2&#34;) which actually rank #1 on my list of favorites<br /><br />They have a very soft feel to them and absorb shock exceptionally well. I feel support in all the right places, especially arch support. I also like that there is an extra piece of stronger material added to the mesh at the precise point that one's big toe ultimately wears through at the near tip of the shoes.<br /><br />Very comfortable, good looking, and well-designed shoes. The only thing left to test is their durability, which I will update when I put a bit of mileage on them	2015-08-07

In the style department my 2 year old twins look retro and very cool in the shoe. The colors are bright and bold. They wear a toddler size 7 and it is not true to fit, I would say it is about a 6 1/2 or toddlers 6. If I had to do it over I would order one size up from true size. Now for the HUGE DOWN SIDES...the velcro on the tops of the shoes is on both sides....this causes issues with walking for the kids because the velcro can't hold the foot in the shoe as they take a natural step. It doesn't completely come undone ever time however I would say in the past two days they have worn them I have had to fix it more than 4 times each day per child....and that is with an easy walk. If they are running or jumping the velcro will not hold the foot in the shoe. The style is great but the velcro on both sides is a bad design and should just be on one side of the top in my opinion. But the Blue and Yellow styling is bold and killer.	2015-08-07

The only reason I gave it four stars was because after work when I got home and took them of I noticed that I may have walked so much that I scuffed some of the red off. I possibly did that when I was walking up cement stairs with a client so I can't really blame this company. I have them in black and soon as I'm done with this review I'm ordering the nude.

But they have nowhere near the arch support of my old pairs of leather Reefs. The arch is one of the reasons that I'm a Reef fan so I'm pretty disappointed about that.  Also, the leather &#34;spacer&#34; between your big and second toe is quite wide on this model and therefore not that comfortable.  I'm keeping these, but probably won't buy Reefs anymore (after 6 previous pairs!).	2015-08-07

If you are not used to wearing shoes without a sock; take this into consideration. Usually a sock will make your foot about 1/2 a size larger. On a different note, these shoes are great. Not perfect arch support (Comparable to Converse or Vans classics), but the sole is comfortable enough to walk in for a few hours at the least. I would recommend waterproofing your pair if you get one with beeswax or similar method as these shoes are canvas and your foot will get soaked in a puddle.<br /><br />Good shoes	2015-08-07

As everyone knows, kids, such as myself, beat the heck out of shoes and I was no different with these. They were my daily shoes that went through every single thing you could think of. Running through the woods, mud, and the usual wear and tear, they held up without a single rip, tear, or breakage at all. The only reason we got rid of them is because I grew out of them. Anything made by Timberland is WELL worth the price you pay. They hold up through anything you can throw at them and then some. They don't take long to break in and, once broken in, fit like a glove. I would highly recommend these boots among the countless other Timberland products if you need something rugged and reliable yet still cleans up nice and presentably.	2015-08-07

Alright, I rarely ever find the motivation to write reviews, but after throwing down 100 bills for these shoes, and enduring the experience I have endured with them, I gotta say something.<br /><br />Official score: 2.5/10<br /><br />These shoes are pretty awful in most ways.<br /><br />The suede is good not great, you'll get ollie holes after a hard 3-5 days of skating. That's whatever I guess, durability in suede uppers is never expected to be great, especially if you skate technical. Shoe Goo fixes that, so the upper is not what bothered me.<br /><br />It's the SOLES.<br /><br />Just awful soles. Each section of tread resides on its own raised platform, so there's all these little tunnels running between these raised platforms. Picture that? Google 'Nike Nano SB Soles' or something. The problem is that every time one of the platforms and its tread slides ever so slightly against the grip tape, which they do constantly of course, the tunnels around the platforms enable the grip tape to begin to RIP the treads off their platforms! You'll be cruising, shifting your feet, setting up for a trick, and you'll feel this floppy thick piece of rubber (the tread) bend and roll up underneath your foot. Its an incredibly frustrating issue. You can superglue the crap out of them, which I do, but it's a temporary fix. The ripping will occur again.<br /><br />Alright, yes, the board feel is pretty superb. I have a pair of Nike Frees and I love them, that's why I couldn't pass the SB version up. I knew the sole would stretch, bend, and twist to my foot's every whimsical desire, but still, purchasing these shoes was a mistake, no doubt in my mind. I could of gotten two pairs of Lakais or Fallens for the price of these. Nike is onto something with the minimalist approach to skate shoes, but these soles need a complete redesign.<br /><br />Oh hey last thought, shoe runs pretty narrow.<br /><br />Goodbye.	2015-08-07

The arch support is fine if you have a normal arch. I have an extremely high arch that makes my footprint look almost like a fishhook, so I will be popping a pair of t-bone shaped pads into these. They are professional without making me look as if I am trying too hard (I teach, and anything a fifty-year-old does that makes it appear that one is trying to be &#34;cool&#34; is going to make one an object of derision and/or suspicion).

I'm ordering the next size up...I won't be without these lovelies!!!	This is actually a good review. These shoes were GORGEOUS! I normally wear a 8 or and 8.5 C/D, which is wide. So I ordered these in a 9 wide just to be sure they would be super as they are going to a very important event. When I took them out of the box, I was positively giddy! They were beautifully made, lovely color (Black Paris), then my dream ended. I tried the shoes on and could just barely get my feet into them. They were a tad too short from heel to toe and way to small in the width area. Normally, I can do an 8 C/D or even 8.5 C/D and be just fine, but I couldn't even wear these 9 C/D shoes for 10 minutes. I did return them and since my event is day after tomorrow, I can't take a chance that the next largest wide pair would work, so I went with another brand, just for this event. I put the next size up 10 C/D in this FANTASTIC shoe in my wish list and they are in my next top 3 purchases.  Lovely shoes, beautifully made, a little breath-taking when you see then in Black Paris, so they are coming my way very soon!!!	2015-08-07

The H3 model name means this shoe has stability support (arch and pronation) and maximum cushioning. Other Pearl Izumi shoes have less cushioning and less support, which may be more appropriate for some people. My feet need the extra support and I've been having a hard time finding shoes with both support and cushioning. These shoes have both to keep my feet happy on long runs. The sole is pretty soft, so durability is questionable. I bought a spare pair while the price was a super cheap $42. These shoes come in lots of different colors (some kind of ugly). The black & red is the best looking IMHO.<br /><br />Sizing is a little larger than the New Balance shoes that I've been using (size 9), but not enough bigger for me to switch to a smaller size.	2015-08-07

The material is nice and plush, the traction is good, and the colors are as advertised.  The fit of the uppers is tight, but I expect it will stretch with wear.  The two problems are with the fit and with the sharp raised rim of the sole.  The sizes given on the amazon size chart do not match the tags on the product, which say that the upper size limit of a medium is 8 and the lower limit of a large is 9.5.  I'm an 8.5 and got a large, and the fit is in some ways too big, in some too small, and in some ok (I realize this is a strange description).  My foot rests within the inner seam you can see in the picture, and the slipper doesn't flap around on my foot but that large outer rim is a tripping risk.  As for being too small, it's because the rubber sole rises to contain the cushion and has an almost-sharp edge, which both my toes and heel to seem to step on at times despite being contained within that inner line when at rest.  Despite these issues, I am largely satisfied with the product and will be keeping it, but I forsee sandpaper in my future.	2015-08-07

Given its price here at the sub $150 mark, I feel this pair exhibited some of the best quality I've seen in that bracket. You could easily spend more on Ray Bans or Oakleys and not get the same sense of quality; especially in the frame. I think Oakley lenses are very good, despite their fragile coatings, but the frames are nothing special, and yet most of their sunglasses start around $120. Just about all of that money is going towards the lenses (and the branding), which of course are the heart of the product. However, even the best lenses are useless without a good frame to keep them on your head. I don't have much experience with Revo as a brand, but I got the sense here that the money you spend goes into not only quality lenses, but also a sturdy, well-designed frame (love the nose bridge grips like you find on some Smith and Native pairs) and an impressive carrying case. Compare that with the cheap microfiber sack that Oakley typically provides with most of their sub-$200 pairs...Presentation does matter, and I don't think its unreasonable to expect that a pair of $100+ sunglasses should be packaged with some form of actual case. Serengeti Sunglasses come with a rigid clam-shell case and a fairly large microfiber cloth. Native sunglasses come with a zippered semi-rigid case *and* a microfiber sack. Similarly, the Revo Huddie came with both a microfiber sack as well as a hard case. As a total product, I really felt like I got my money's worth with these, which isn't something I can say about several pairs of sunglasses I've purchased from the other &#34;premium&#34; brands.<br /><br /> Ultimately, I should admit I didn't end up keeping this pair, but it had nothing to do with its quality or value. Rather, the style didn't end up looking that good on me as the lens profile was rounder than I prefer, and the base curve of the frame seemed more like a 7 (they wrap more) than the flatter 6 I'm used to in this style. It's a shame because I really wanted these to be my favorite pair. Visually, I'd say they compare to the Wayfarer Justin, only the lenses are rounder in profile and perhaps a tiny bit shorter top to bottom. Do check them out though if you have a small to medium face and are in the market for a rounded lens wayfarer-style pair.ke a 7 (they wrap more) than the flatter 6 I'm used to in this style.

He works in retail, usually 9-10 hours a day on wooden floors and on three stories! He was constantly complaining of foot, ankle, knee, and leg pain after work, and wanted to try something new. He selected these basically off of how they look, but they seem to have exceeded his expectations. They arrived when expected, no obvious flaws, and I haven't heard a single complaint about any work-related pain since he started wearing them! He has kind of long feet (and long toes), and these don't squish any part of his feet. I love Clarks shoes, and am glad to say that they have once again done a great job in making a comfortable, true-to-size and expectation shoe.	2015-08-07

These are soooo comfortable and they are cute too. There was no blistering when I first started wearing them or any other discomfort for that matter. I feel these run true to size maybe slightly narrow but that could be because I was used to very well loved Crocs that had lost some of their structure.

This shoe is super comfortable	You'll likely have to size down. I sized down half a size from my normal size I wear with Nikes (don't really know why, but I always use them as a reference shoe for sizing), and it's about perfect.<br /><br />This shoe is super comfortable. So, so comfortable.<br /><br />The coloring is...strange. Sometimes it looks really grey to me...without a hint of brown, and other times it looks like it's the typical dark brown suede color without a hint of grey. As I said it's strange. Really, really strange. It looks brown more often than it looks grey, but there are definitely times when I look at them that they look very grey. Might explain the two conflicting answers to the Customer Questions and Answers concerning the shoe color.<br /><br />Can't speak for its durability (though, its sleek soles that help make it look so great vs the typical thick &#34;hiking&#34; shoe sole does make me wonder a little about that). I'll update the review whenever the soles eventually wear down.	2015-08-07

Absolutely positively love these shoes! They are so different, so cool, and they are just happy.<br /><br />I love that these are not like any other heels with the design I have ever seen before. All the way down to the fact it has a white tip on the hill. And even though that's going to get dirty if you don't take care of it, I strongly suggest using a clear coat of superglue around it. That way when it does get dirty, you can just peel off the super glue, and it's back to you it's perfect white. Just be careful so that you don't get it on the actual shoe, and try to keep it on just the white tips.	2015-08-07

I wear an 11 in every shoe I own (vans, Nike, New Balance, etc) and sized down to a 10 which gives me a perfect fit. Definitely size down one whole size. Even with thick or thinner grade Stance socks, one size down and you'll be happy. Also, the beeswax leather is stiff so breaking in will take a couple of days. They break in nicely though and look great. I did try on some suedes and they're soft so no worries on breaking in if you go suede. The beeswax colorway can go with most everything in your wardrobe from denim to slacks. Perfect for business or casual. The crepe soles make for a more flexible, cush experience but keep in mind the soles are thin so you will be able to feel what you're waliking on. All in all, these are the perfect casual chukka boot I was looking for. Very happy with my purchase.	2015-08-07

I bought these as new running shoes before I remembered I had a vacation to Yellowstone coming up in a few weeks that I didn't have any good shoes for either, so they quickly became hiking shoes as well.  They are very comfortable, but I have an issue at the toe where the lining of the shoe is curling inward on the inside of the shoe and hitting my toes.  It's not a *huge* deal, but it is very annoying.  Because of that I probably wouldn't buy these exact shoes again but I'm not planning to stop wearing them anytime soon. UPDATE: Dec 2015 Whatever issue there was with the lining of the shoe curling up has resolved itself.  These are one of my favorite pairs of shoes.  They work great for everyday wear as well as running.	2015-08-07

Size was slightly large so that heel of foot tended to pull out when walking.  This might not have been a problem if the heel cut of the slipper was a little higher.  It was much too shallow.  This resulted in stepping on this &#34;edge&#34; when the foot heel came down.  If you're going to make a slip-on slipper I'd suggest either making it with no heel cuff at all or raising that area of the slipper so that it better cuffs the foot heel.  Sorry to have to return these.	2015-08-07

This is a good shoe for the price, but they are listed as a basketball shoe, and I don't recommend them for basketball.  They don't offer the ankle support that I need.  If you do want to buy these for basketball, I would recommend going somewhere and trying them on first to make sure they fit securely.  My feet move around too much when making cuts and I can't get the shoe tight enough to avoid this.  Possibly I could go down a half size, but I've been wearing the same size for 20+ years.  Again, a good shoe, but when you buy online without trying them on, you take the risk of not getting a perfect fit.	2015-08-07

I bought this pair of Crocs for several reasons:<br />I wanted a harder sole than that on the original Crocs. Texas Mesquite Tree thorns will go right thru the original softer sole, much easier than it will on this sole.<br />I wanted a more secure heal strap, that could still be moved forward on the shoe and be out of the way.<br />I needed a shoe that is easy to get on and off, because of knee surgery I recently endured.<br />I needed another pair, because the original pair I bought, are truly worn out, and I expect this pair will last, even longer.<br />I like the two tone color and contrast of this pair of Crocs, much better than the coloring of the original Crocs.	2015-08-07

The first time around I ignored the other reviews and just followed the size chart, which was big mistake and the sandals were way too big (surprise, surprise). I usually wear a US women's size 9 in the regular width so I went with size 40M, which I then exchanged for a size 39M. Luckily it was really easy (and free!) to return these with amazon! After returning for a smaller size, I absolutely love them. The colors, the materials, and the style make this one gorgeous and extremely comfortable pair of sandals. These shoes are also very versatile as you can wear them for anything really and they look and feel great. The style even makes them a great sandal for dressier occasions. They are now my go to spring/summer/fall shoes and I have my eye on another pair in the mocha color.<br /><br />I have a thing for comfortable, properly fitting, and supportive shoes. I also believe that shoes can be overly supportive and can cause the muscles in your feet to weaken and work improperly, which leads to all sorts of problems. Which is why I like rotate through and wear different types of shoes (disclaimer: I also just love quality shoes), in addition to spending a decent amount of time barefoot. Doing this not only makes the muscles in my feet adapt and work hard, keeping them strong, but it helps my shoes last a lot longer. With these shoes though, I just want to wear them all day, every day, that's how comfortable they are. Right out of the box they felt great, no adjustment period necessary, and have they become more comfortable every time I wear them. Everyone is different though and if they don't feel great right away I would encourage you not to give up, but to make sure they are the right size and that straps are as tight as they can (reasonably) be. If uncomfortable, wearing them for small time periods at first can help as it allows your feet to adjust. As your feet adjust and the shoe molds to your foot you may just find that these are likenirvana in sandal form!	2015-08-07

The texture is similar to Elmer's white glue ...	I recently purchased a pair of Birkenstocks and heard that it would be wise to apply cork glue to prevent the cork from falling apart. Many people said that this product was comparable to the glue sold by Birkenstock so I decided to give it a shot since it's cheaper than the Birkenstock glue. Upon opening the product, there is a slight chemical odor but it isn't significantly annoying. The texture is similar to Elmer's white glue but a bit more runny which is why there is a brush applicator. It applies on white but dries clear which is really helpful during application so that you can tell where you haven't yet applied the glue. I followed the instructions and applied the second coat after 20 minutes. My Birkenstocks look great :)	2015-08-07

It's like walking on clouds!! I purchased mine at Quiksilver I'm typically a size 6-7 in most shoe wear but when I tried them on in a size 6 they had fit my foot just too perfect like in the wrong way at the edge of my heel so I had to up a size on the flip foot to a 7 and it was perfect! So like the other review going up a size (they mentioned half size but they don't carry have sizes) will deff do the trick! When I say walking on clouds I'm not kidding. Walking in these is a whole new experience. It perfectly conforms to your foot it doesn't flatten out either it's stays spongy and fluffed. Only thing that's weird is if they get wet it's a weird feeling on your toes and they get sqeeky in a different way than most normal flip flips do. But it's not in a way that will tweak you and make you hate these flip flops! These are awesome and will very easily become an everyday item that you will be wearing, I have both colors and they run the same. Ive been working work retail for several years now so I know how most things fit different from size to size color to color and cut to cut. These are all made same if that makes any sense two different color flip flops of the same style in the same size will both be the same. All I can say is 1/2 size at most will do. So if your 6.5 get 7. If your 6...go up and  Get 7. I'm sure you get what I mean.  So weird gross info to help you out here and I try and put a picture up too I mean sure my foot at the highest possible length I could (because obviously your whole foot is gonna have to fit on the shoe) I measured at little less than 9 inches so little less than 22 centimeters.. And the flip flops measure at just about 9.5 inches @ a size 7. So .. Foot fits PERFECTLY ON IT! And I wear my black ones more so you'll notice by the picture	2015-08-07

They're stylish and I get compliments on them quite often. Perfect to rid the pain of my Mortons Neuroma. I wear them from the moment I get up until I go back to bed at night - and I live in New York City and walk over  10,000 steps per day.  I wish Crocs would make a shoe with the same level of arch support so I which I could wear In the winter.<br /><br />I do buy them one size smaller because they do stretch; while a little snug the first couple of days they stretch.  It takes a day or two, I put  lotion on my feet to help break them in and then they become &#34;perfect&#34;. Actually they stretch out more and more over time but always remain comfortable.<br /><br />I'll keep buying.	2015-08-07

Since my feet would be considered a large, they would never fit into these, but my niece on the other hand has some perfect sized feet for these. So, for her birthday last week, I gave these to her, knowing that she probably would wait till the air cooled off a bit before wearing these. She did wear them as I asked her to and she wouldn't take them off.  I would have been roasting but I guess kids have different reactions to heat. I definitely recommend these for either yourself or your niece, or your daughter.	2015-08-07

I always expect something to be wrong with these types of sandals, and am glad I risk it.  It is TRUE to size, looks nice on the foot, and even though it fits a little loose (not too much) around the ankle, I am GLAD it is, because these types of shoes tend to be too tight around the ankle, making them either too stiff, or rub against the skin while walking.  I am also so thrilled that they had these in gray, since finding nice gray shoes is hard at times.  I am a happy camper!!!	2015-08-07

If you are looking for a belt that you have a little extra length passed the buckle (over 2&#34; or 3&#34;) I would order a little bit bigger because it didn't have a lot of extra length only 2 &#34;-3&#34; maybe passed the buckle.	2015-08-07

They're really cute, fit true to size, and extremely lightweight. Almost lightweight to a fault. I've owned several pairs of DC kids shoes and these almost feel like knock offs because of how light they are. I'm thinking it was probably by design as this would be an extremely heavy shoe traditionally. These also mark up really easily; he had several dark makes on the sides of the soles after wearing these once. But white shoes with a 4 year old boy, I didn't expect them to stay shiny long.	2015-08-07

They got wider during pregnancy and stayed that way. But do not expect to put a too-wide foot into a d'orsay pump and be comfortable. They cut in a lot. They are super cute so I put up with it but I can really only wear them for very short periods of time. I take them off as soon as I'm in the office, or car, or when I get home. So I would not repurchase for this reason, but especially for the reason discussed below.<br /><br />These shoes are well priced and attractive but they are not holding up well. I've only worn them a few times and there is already noticeable wear in the back, where the heel meets the upper back portion. The leather/pleather is ripping and wearing away. I noticed this after I had worn them three times. I did not walk great distances (way too uncomfortable for that), nor did I drive in them (I never drive in heels). If I pay $30-40 I don't expect them to last forever but I expect them to at least go for a couple of seasons!	2015-08-07

Great shoes . When I un-boxed them I said wow! These shoes look cool.  I was very surprised to be able to fit them. I have wide feet and usually have trouble fitting nice smooth style shoes like these but, not this time. I plan to wear these shoes a couple times before the summer ends.<br />The man reasons I like these shoes so much is because 1. Many top designers do not design stylish shoes for men that wear size 12, and 13.<br />2. The price is amazing. I do not expect these shoes to be as sturdy as some of my other shoes because I'm quite sure they are not. I'm just grateful<br />that this designer decided to include larger sizes at a very affordable cost.	2015-08-07

Took a bit long for mailings. The first pair (MX) were much too big but the company exchanged them for a smaller size style (S). which I appreciate. I like them a lot. Much better coverage than clip-ons, and easier to take off and put on on days that are mixed cloud and sunshine. Likewise, easy to put up on my head and then I still have my glasses on when I go inside (and also the reverse).  Great selection of different color frames and lenses. I think I'll get another pair in different colors.	2015-08-07

It's the perfect size to fit all of my essentials (including my gigantic sunglasses case). This is a genuine Kate Spade bag. I'm always a little skeptical buying handbags online that are &#34;good deals&#34; for fear they might be knock offs but this one is the real deal. I was also happily surprised that it arrived early! Thanks for the awesome service! Someone asked if it will keep its shape and the answer is YES! It only dips a little at the top (along the zipper) when you use it as a handbag if it's not totally full. Otherwise, it keeps its shape :) The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the shoulder strap is too short to use as a cross body. The picture of the model using it is not accurate. It's also smaller in real life than what I was expecting but I still love it nonetheless :)	2015-08-07

So when I was offered these super cute Kids Conda Blue Loafers for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about them, I had to order them for my son. He is pretty pimp already but as soon as daddy saw these, he was very jealous and wanted his own pair. They are a bit on the narrow side but that could also be due to the fat feet my baby has. They are a little shorter than I would have liked but at least he could wear them a few times to impress all the baby girls in the neighborhood. I recommend these for anyone who wants to get their baby some super cute Loafers. Oh, and there are a handful of colors to choose from.	2015-08-07

I wanted to find a shoe that crossed over from casual to being able to wear it out for dinner. This fit the bill perfectly. The heel is not too high that you cant walk around comfortably and the foot bed is padded nicely. The sole of this shoe has plenty of traction - not sure if it is rubber but feels sturdy and no chance of slipping on uneven or wet surfaces. I am between an 8 & 8 1/2 in shoes. Born boots I am always an 8 but have a pair of their flats in an 8 and they killed my feet after about 30 minutes wear so somewhat nervous with the sizing of these. I went with the 8 and out of the box felt a little snug across the toes but after about 20 minutes walking around the house in them they loosened up nicely and was comfortable wearing them for about 6 hours. True test was wearing them again the next day on errands and had them on for at least 10 hours with no issue	2015-08-07

This shoe fits the bill for a few hours IF I'm not on my feet the entire time. The arch support is good, especially if I use the heel strap, as it keeps my food where it should be in the shoe. The only mild complaint I have is that the heel well isn't as soft as I'd like it to be (I have a heel spur currently). I'll probably use these interchangeably with my Oofos clogs, which have a softer heel and similar arch support, but are more expensive. All in all, a good mule for much more comfortable walking.	2015-08-07

Just like many reviewers have stated, this particular style runs a bit narrow.  I ordered size 9 4E and they fit fine and definitely not (too) Wide.  Length appears to be right for me but you might want to order this style a half size longer and wider to assure adequate comfort especially if you plan on inserting custom orthopedic inserts or innersoles.<br />PS:  Lots of complaints about the Velcro Straps being too short?  Mine, when stretched and tightened properly are fine?  Caught them on Sale here on Amazon for just over $50 with free shipping.  Great value, IMO.  Lets see how they hold up.	2015-08-07

Beautiful design and colors and the strap feels great on the body.  But, the front two pockets on the flap are almost unusable unless you are putting flat items in that are not very heavy.  And if you put a few items in the front flap pocket (a small mirror and a small bag containing a small beaded necklace is what I put in), the magnetic closure underneath become difficult to snap closed.  I wasn't overly excited by the flap to close the purse anyway, works well for security to keep anyone from reaching into your bag in a crowded airport or a street fair but I wasn't fond of having to flip the flap over to get into the bag. I knew this going into the purchase, so this was my own fault.  Inside pocket of the bag is great and the depth of the bag is great. And the coated canvas was a plus for me, wipes clean so easily!	2015-08-07

She would twirl about everywhere we went because she enjoyed the feeling of spinning and it dulled any level of boredom she faced.  The shoes look really nice and are supportive in the arches as they seem a bit narrow but she never complained.  They held their shape after 1 year of constant wear.  The only thing is the ruffle on the end after lots of wear and tear can get bent or pull back and the sequins do try to work as a lint brush if you have animals in the house. HA!  But, they really held up well for my daughter so even if it doesn't get a 5, I'd give it a 4.5 for looks and enjoyment.	2015-08-07

I have wide feet, and for the first week I worried about the boots stretching. I've had boots with cheap leather give up and blow out at the seams or separate from the sole, and I've also had great quality Docs REFUSE to stretch. These Sinleys stretched perfectly. At first, they wrinkled strangely around the ankle and I wondered what kind of weird wax or coating had been put on the boot to make them do that. But after a month of hard use, they've held up and the leather is buttery soft like a dream. The ankle is a bit wide, but the heel fits well enough that I know they'll never slip off by accident. The zipper has held up to the daily abuse of being yanked shut from strange angles because my balance is a bit questionable in the morning.<br /><br />These are surprisingly good quality leather for the price. I use leather cleaner and conditioner on them about once every other month. Since I wasn't a fan of how shiny they were when new, I haven't waxed or used polish on them again. After cleaning, they're still the original color and look stunning. However, add a few weeks of dust and kicking around and they get a nice worn, faded look to them that I love.	2015-08-07

I got it in blue and like the color very much. The smallest outside pocket holds a small pack of tissues, and in the larger outside pocket I can fit my portable phone charger and tube of hand cream. Someone complained about the size of the inside pockets but my iPhone 5 fits perfectly in one and a small notepad in the other. The inside zipper pocket is roomy. As with all large purses / totes, it's easy to lose your keys in the abyss, but overall, I really like the size, shape, and versatility of this one. Just wish there was a large zipped section in the middle, as some purses have. I use the shorter straps for everyday and the shoulder strap when I travel. I use the snap closure for everyday and the zipper when traveling, so nothing falls out and nobody can reach in. Very nice purse at an excellent price.	2015-08-07

The color just pops and they are surprisingly comfortable. They actually look better in person than in the pictures.<br /><br />You will NOT be disappointed. You will fall in love. They are so easy to walk in and the size is spot on!!<br /><br />Disclaimer I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review	2015-08-07

Okay so I bought these for work because I love wedges and they seemed like classy nice. At first I was hesitant because I work in retail and I do a lot of standing and walking. But I gave them a shot and they were so comfortable!! However, they tend to get squeaky after wearing them for a long time but I think socks should do the trick and quiet them. And if you're like me, and get blisters from new shoes then yeah after my first wear I got a blister but they're nice and comfy which evens it out I guess. :) I will definitely buy them again if mine get destroyed or wear out.<br /><br />P.S. Yes they do reek of an annoying chemical smell, but it's slowly fading away.	2015-08-07

The rest  of the shoe fits fine and the insole is comfortable.  These shoes are well made.  I wore them almost daily during a three week trip to Europe and still where them with comfort.  I think they are even suitable to where with socks and slacks this fall.  I said they didn't have good arch support, but then my feet are quite flat and too much arch support tends to be uncomfortable.  I usually where an 8.5 M so next time I will order a Jambu in my usual size. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.	2015-08-07

I purchased these sandals in the black color from another place, after searching everywhere for them in my size. Typically, I wear a size 9.5; however, I can normally fluctuate between a 9 or 10, depending on the make of the shoe, but always in a Medium width. I am so glad I did purchase these in a 9.5, rather than another size, as these fit perfectly. I have high arches and average-sized (medium) ankles, even though I'm plus size. I had read previous user reviews pertaining to size being too snug, or shoes not fitting right because of arch issues. I guess this specific shoe is not meant for everyone? I don't know. What I do know, however, is that they fit me perfectly and look amazing (see photo I posted)!! This is a must-buy!	2015-08-07

The shades are made from recycled materials and the only way you can tell is by the symbol on one of the arms, they are well made and very stylish. I have 3 boys ages 3 thru 17 and they are fighting over my shades so I will be purchasing another set for them. My shades are black on black with polished lens. I recommend these shades to those who love the water but hate the glare. I received this product free in exchange for my review and honest opinion.	2015-08-07

Not happy at all with these.<br /><br />I have applied for a refund, and I am awaiting the vendor's review/decision. Will return if I can. Will gift to a friend if I can't.

It's handles are very handy (hah!) for someone like me who is going to high school and needs to move all of their belongings between their purse and their backpack very often.

My best friend was over when I got my package and opened my new sunglasses.  We were both so impressed with the quality of the glasses from design to the finishing metal touches. I had ordered two pairs of glasses since the value was so great and ended up giving one pair to my friend.  It is now months later and she just told me they are her go to sunglasses. I am so glad I took the plunge!    A special bonus -  the glasses come in a hard shell case.  Simply black nothing pretty but more than I expected exceedingly functional.  I use the case to store my glasses in my car or purse.   I highly recommend purchasing a couple pairs.  I like to switch out my look some times.	2015-08-07

With this designer every shoe fit differently	These shoes are beautiful!  With this designer every shoe fit differently, and I had initially ordered a size 9, some fit, others were too small, and the size 9 of this shoe was too big.  I returned them and got my natural size 8.5 and these look like they were made for my feet.  I'm using these for my wedding day, so I will warn the heel is high and you may need to break them in (or practice walking), but overall they're very comfortable even with the heel being so high.  Honestly in all my wedding shoe shopping these were one the most comfortable shoes I've found.  That being said I never spent more than 30 minutes in them yet, so we will see how wearing them for 2+ hours goes, but honestly I believe that any shoe you wear for an extended period of time (multiple hours consecutively) will be uncomfortable by the end...	2015-08-07

The description suggested ordering 1/2 size up, so I ordered both my size and 1/2 size up.  My regular size worked best for me.  They seem to be good quality.  It annoys me to have to buy an arch support insoles to put into an expensive shoe, thus far I am using the insole in that came in the shoe, and so far so good.  I walk 5 to 6 miles a day.  I am 50+ years old and slightly overweight - so my feet don't feel great, but these are much better than most shoes I have tried on lately.  I have bought and returned 5 or more walking shoes this year trying to find a decent pair, I have not been pleased with quality vs. price.  I never thought I was all that picky until this year.  I have been wearing Columbia hiking shoes that last few years.  I consider this shoe a good value and really good quality.	2015-08-07

I chased after a wind blown canopy through mud and they stayed on my feet. Not the best for water wear, but they hold up with water wear.... haven't stretched out.  Very pleased with quality, comfort, and style. They should last many more seasons.	2015-08-07

These are some of the most comfortable, versatile sandals I've ever owned - and I've owned A LOT!<br /><br />Living in Florida, flip flops aren't a fashion statement, they are a way of life.  It's tough to find a pair that are comfortable when walking, work well around water and have a modicum of &#34;fashion&#34; to them.  These sandals have been the best fit in all three categories for a single pair of shoes!<br /><br />I wore these for days on end, hours at a time walking through the streets of Key West with no pain or issues to my feet or back.  Keep in mind, they are still flip flops, but for what they are, they are sturdy, supportive and extremely durable!  I was both skeptical and supremely impressed.  The wider strap and thicker sole helped cushion my feet and kept them from rubbing in all the wrong places with the miles of walking I did.<br /><br />I also wore them on the boat, around the pool and to the beach with great comfort and they did remarkably well in the wet environments.  The treads were safe and secure on the slick surfaces and the footbed didn't get so wet that my foot slid around on top of the shoe.  The only &#34;issue&#34; (I want to use that term very loosely, it's not an issue, it's a minor annoyance that did not impact the use or function of the product at all) that barely bears mentioning is that they developed a slight squeak until they were completely dried out.  Once the water was all gone, so was the noise.<br /><br />I am so delighted with these sandals.  I gave them a chance based on a great price and some pretty favorable reviews and I am sorry that I ever hesitated!  I am a firm believer and highly recommend these to anyone and everyone who will listen!	2015-08-07

My foot is a 7.5 to 8.0 Medium depending on the manufacturer and sometimes 8.5 with the Italian designers. My original AA Roxi is an 8.0 and it fits perfectly. Length is just right & width is medium - my foot does not go over the front or sides or back.  Based on the other reviews I purchased this &#34;re-make Roxi&#34; in size 9 silver. On this version the length is too long, and the width is very narrow, so the sides of my foot hang over both sides of the sandal. Not a desirable fit. It seems like it's made for a triple A width foot.  The manufacturer who &#34;copied&#34; the original, just did not get the proportions correct.  I do not recommend this strangely proportioned &#34;re-make Roxi&#34; if you want your sandal to fit properly.  (P.S. For the record, I NEVER even attempted to &#34;rate&#34; my own review. Like so many various &#34;online sites&#34; this one is not perfect. So buyer beware, and do not believe everything that the web site and sellers say. I have been duped too many times to count by sellers. And I do not care who does or does not like or agree with my evaluations.)	2015-08-07

The shoe was the EXACT same size as my foot, so when walking there was no room for error so to speak.  The worst thing about ladies footwear is seeing toes or heels hanging over the sides...Return was easy.  Ordered my first pair of size 7's... same shoe just a bigger size.  Fit perfectly.

I like these shoes they are a good option for summer shoes at day care. They have a flexible sole and no arch supports which I like since that's what they tell me babies are supposed to have?

I think that some of the softer shoes like a robeez or similar style stay on his feet much much better. These shoes seem to run wide and larger than other shoes.	2015-08-07

Fast delivery, no issues there.  The product itself is not made very well.  The stitching started coming loose between the toe of the sock and the strap after the first night's wear.  I didn't have it over-tightened either.  I tightened it exactly as the directions suggested.  The other issue I have with the sock is that it pulls your toes back, but not from the ball of your foot.  The foot itself can still flex.  It seems it would be a better design if the tension was applied across the ball of the foot, and not the toes.  Rather uncomfortable the way it is designed.  All that aside, it did help some.  I wore it several nights in a row and it did help alleviate the heel pain I was experiencing in the morning when first applying weight to my foot.	2015-08-07

I have big feet...Women's size 10...so I am very used to my shoes looking big. When I pulled these out of the box, they looked so huge that I thought for a second I had accidentally ordered a men's size 10! I have never had a problem with shoes being too narrow before, but these are very narrow and squeezed my foot all the way down, even though there was still extra length. I know boots often times will stretch out with wear, but I didn't want to be stuck with them and waste that much money if they didn't. So these are being returned. So there's my experience as a big footed gal...for those of you on the smaller side, maybe they are a little better proportioned.	2015-08-07

Upon writing this review, I realized I was expecting these glasses to give me awesome night vision. In reality they are just sunglasses with amber lenses.  I was expecting those glasses that you see on TV where without them you see glares from headlights and signs and then when they are on things are much clearer.  I don't know if that is just a TV gimmick or what, but these do not improve night driving very much (if at all).<br /><br />Furthermore, the shade starts out strong and dark(ish) at the top (by the frame) and gradually fades to a lighter tint at the bottom.  I personally find this rather annoying and would prefer a constant tint throughout the glasses.  However, maybe it helps see the instrument cluster better (just my guess).<br /><br />In conclusion, I would not buy these again for night time driving glasses.	2015-08-07

At first these shoes caused me quite a bit of discomfort because of the top buckle. It's a little ridiculous that I had to literally form calluses on top of my feet for these to become comfortable. HOWEVER. I did. And then they were perfect. And really, REALLY cute and comfortable. I've had tendon problems in my feet because of my shoes before, but these never gave me any trouble. They were very comfortable once broken in, and I loved them with all my heart.<br />However, after all that, about 4 or 5 months into wearing these daily (mostly just around my college campus, no serious activity in them of course), they completely fell apart. Both shoes' buckles tore away from the rest of the shoe while I was just strolling down the street. I have honestly considered buying another pair because of how much I loved them at the time of wearing them, but they're fare too expensive to have broken in the first place, and I have no more faith in the brand.	2015-08-07

My first pair are a size 7 and it took an age to get them on (several days in fact) but I persevered and once on they were very comfortable. I always planned on getting a dark brown pair but this time round I could not face the hassle of fighting to get them on and off so I just ordered a size 7.5 which went on very easily and still fits well in the footbed.  This pair was considerably cheaper than the almost $400 I paid for the first and I did wonder if they were seconds; the sole and heel are straight, I cannot see any loose stitches anywhere but they are very scuffed/distressed looking but I seem to recall my black ones looked very much the same when they first arrived.  I polished them up a treat and I shall do the same with these.  Overall I am very pleased with this style.  A little bit western but also a little bit equestrian too.	2015-08-07

I bought this shoe a half size up (per many reviewers). It seemed they fit length wise but they seemed really wide. I wore them only briefly to walk around when trying them on.

I did not want to downsize and risk them being to small in length.	2015-08-07

Why yes, a little bit, but they are handmade in the USA (El Paso, TX) and worth every cent. First off, they fit me perfectly. Secondly, they are so soft and require no break in at all. Talk about comfortable to wear and walk in. Lastly, I think they look excellent. All leather including the sole, which I prefer. It is a little slick at first until you walk in it a little and the sole gets roughed up. Then they provide good traction, like all leather soles. Cushioning is good as well. You get absolutely no instruction as to break in, care or anything else with them, but that isn't much of a problem. I haven't treated them with anything yet. They have a bit of a worn look, which is nice. I also have a pair of Justins and there is no comparison in fit and comfort between the two. I will buy Tony Lama again and again. Highly recommended.	2015-08-07

I got these for my husband as a Bday present and he loves them! I also have them and find that they are very practical for workouts with weightlifting and DU's. They are very similar to the Nano 2.0, the only difference is that they are harder in material, specially in the heel. This helps if the workout has weightlifting, and it's not as hard as the regular weightlifing shoes, were it's harder to do double unders. As for the sizing, they run same as Nano 2.0	2015-08-07

The first time I wore them was for a baseball game in Spring 2015.  The shoes lasted 2 games before completely separating where shoe meets spike in front.  Return process is a joke.  Contacted Adidas and it costs more to ship shoes back than the shoes cost on Amazon in first place.  Additionally, when taking down information to relay to Adidas, I discovered the manufacturing date was November 2007.  No wonder the shoes came apart, adhesives don't last that long!  Amazon dropped the ball on this one.	2015-08-07

Anybody who has ever owned a genuine designer bag would know that Braccialini would NEVER make this low quality bag. The material was not the soft leather that Braccialini is known for, it is a cheap rigid plastic, the brand name did not appear as you would accepted from a designer bag as the seller named his bag. If you are going to sell a knock off call it a knock of and sell it for knock off prices, but to sell something claiming it to be a quality brand and sell it at name brand prices is dishonest and unethical. Buyer beware if you are going to spend $200 on a purse spend a few extra dollars and get the real thing you will be MUCH happier. This is not a Braccialini bag please quit calling it one.	2015-08-07

I ended up walking on my tip-toes for the day to avoid the pain. The length and width sizing were my normal 8.5. The structure on the side seems very poor and kind of collapses on my foot, leading to a weird slouchy look that is not attractive. Overall, they do not fit like a glove as I was expecting. This could be due to the shape of my foot, but I have not had issues like this before. Unfortunately, because I wore them all day (inside), the soles are a bit darkened so I doubt I can return them.	2015-08-07

I also own the Dirk Polarized in black. I love the polarized versions as it cleans up your vision greatly and makes colors POP out. I also fish and go boating quite often, so these shades are important as they remove the glare on the water and enable you to see below the surface, whether it be to see your bait in the water or oncoming obstacles that could do damage to your boat. Recommend. Lightweight and comfortable, they have many styles. I will probably buy the Logan Polarized next.	2015-08-07

I have flat feet so disregard the arch support comment, please. I can tell you that the support is not so aggressive that the shoes are uncomfortable for someone with flat feet - which is difficult to find sometimes.  I love the classic look coupled with Croc's shoebed.  I wore these shoes through a week at Walt Disney World chasing three children around and never had to complain about aches. I wear 9.5 and these are the closest comfortable option as Crocs do not come in half sizes.  No issues with slipping even on slick, wet concrete. One comment for those with wide feet - wearing these shoes without socks you will feel the point where the croslite sole stitches to the canvas body. A simple pair of socks remedies any discomfort from this condition.  The slip on model does not seem to have this quirk.	2015-08-07

These are the type of Locs I've been looking for, for years. The tint is dark, fits well, and they aren't digging into my face nor smearing my eyelashes.

As soon as I took it out of the box I immediately loved the weight and feel of the bag. It didn't feel cheap, and the inside lining was thicker than I was expecting. I'd read some reviews and had some concerns but it's not a silky kind of lining but rather a softer cotton style which lends some credibility to the fact that it will most likely not tear or rip easily. All the zippers and clasps were intact and looked securely made into the bag, and I didn't find any of the zippers on the compartments to be faulty or broken.<br /><br />The bag itself had all the compartments that I could hope for and I was thrilled when everything I had in my large hobo bag fit with ease and took some of the unnecessary space which was one of my complaints with it. It is a &#34;floppy&#34; style bag so if you don't have it at least half full, it will fall over, but I have mine right about half filled and it sits up nicely.<br /><br />Lastly, the material which I mentioned earlier, feels fantastic and sound. I love the softness without the weakness that this fabric looks to be as I am a little brutal on my bags. Over all, I think that this was well worth the money I paid for it and I would recommend this bad a million times over.	2015-08-07

I looked and looked for a woman's shoe with the black and blue colors and didn't find it.  However, I did find, and ordered, this men's pair that has the colors I wanted.  The toe area is just a wee bit larger in the men's shoe than the corresponding woman's Teva.  So ladies, and perhaps gents, if you don't find what you want in &#34;your&#34; department, consider looking in the &#34;other&#34; department and figure out the size that is appropriate.  You might be pleasantly surprised at what you find.	2015-08-07

I've had these for months and I'm quite happy with them.  I have had multiple pairs of the Birkenstock &#34;Arizona&#34; model which these closely resemble.  In comparison to that model these have a more flexible footbed that does not require maintenance, and the uppers are a synthetic material than can get wet without any detrimental effects.  The tread is much more aggresive than the &#34;Arizona&#34;, which wore down quickly with daily wear and would get smooth and slide on surfaces like smooth concrete and the lines for crosswalks when they were wet.<br /><br />I wear these daily and my feet feel fine, the only thing that I've noticed is some cracking of the synthetic upper where my foot flexes, however this does not bother me much as it is not all that noticeable.	2015-08-07

I compete in powerlifting and have used the Nike Romaleos 2 as well as my friends Adidas Adipowers. I felt that the 0.75&#34; heel in the romaleos and adipowers were a bit too high so when I squatted the shoes would tend to throw me forward. It was also a bit more difficult for me to squat with a wider stance because of the higher heel. I find that the seemingly negligible difference in heel height of ~0.6&#34; for the powerlift 2.0s allow me to squat with the wider stance that I prefer without throwing me forward out of the hole.	2015-08-07

I exchanged the<br />insoles that come with the shoes for my orthotics and then the fit was much better and I still had plenty of tow wiggle room in the toe box. Only very minor slippage in the heal while wearing Thorlo socks.I don't consider these shoes as an exercise walking shoe but rather a great shoe to wear under jeans when dressed casually since they are a very good looking shoe. The price at Amazon was GREAT at $44.00 since everywhere else wanted $79.99 and up. Where else can you get a water resistance leather casual shoe for $44.00 and have it be a New Balance??

I appreciate the way it came packaged with the crafter's signature.

She wears then constantly and they hold up well to wear and tear (with lots of running and playing at the park), she has worn them for about 4 months.

I have logged MANY miles and the soles are not that worn yet. Another thing I like is the lower profile with regard to the collar, as some shoes bother my ankle at the top where the tongue makes contact or the Achilles Notch (upper heel area). It's hard to comment on arch support as I (immediately) replace factory liners with a more supportive insert, so I have not worn them as-is. I have NO complaints about this shoe.<br /><br />In summary, I have worn many different shoes throughout the years and these are so far, by far the best yet. Absolutely love them.

These shoes are great and I would give them five stars except for the following: The thin band across the foot is narrow and tight.  I can wear these shoes for most of the day, but the band starts digging in later and hurts.  The strap across the ankle is ridiculously short.  This makes it hard to buckle.

I never broke these shoes in - the first time I wore them, I walked 16 miles in two days. I didn't get any blisters. Nothing was rubbing, poking, or bothering my feet in any way while I wore them.<br />The next time I wore them was on a two-week hiking trip to Ireland. I walked at least 50 miles with a backpack through fields, on roads, and up a small mountain, and not once had to worry about my feet. (I was the only person in the group I went with who didn't get blisters!)<br />They were even comfortable (and cute) enough to wear around even when I wasn't hiking. They were the only shoes I brought on my trip besides shower shoes and I loved them!<br />I would recommend wearing thicker wool socks with these boots.	2015-08-07

I have some unusual foot/toe issues which has led me to try to find some shoes which are adjustable for swelling feet, open toed AND have an enclosed heel. The choices are very limited with this criteria.  I own the Propet Women's W0089 Pedic Walker Sandal which are wonderful, comfortable and well made BUT they are over $70 and not the most attractive!<br />I thought I would give these a try and ordered my normal size 9.  They were HUGE - by an entire size so I'm not sure if these were mismarked or if they just run this big.  The company was great for the return and shipped out a replacement size 8 right away!  They fit perfectly.<br /><br />What I like:<br />Adjustable width for swelling feet<br />Very soft, comfortable insole with memory foam and anti-microbial material<br />Well made sole (although the pattern on the bottom of the shoe looks like MJ leaves! huh??) Not black so it won't leave marks on the floor<br />Upper material is lightweight, but well made fabric that looks easy to clean<br />Not bad looking for the type of shoe this is...not so &#34;older woman&#34; looking ;)<br />A bit of a heel - about 1&#34; - which is nice and in a wedge so there's no pressure on the ball of the foot<br />Can be worn all day without my  feet hurting<br />Overall a great shoe for the price!<br /><br />I took off one star for the sizing issue again, not knowing if this pair was mis-marked or if they truly run very big	2015-08-07

I moved to Florida and didn't want to wear sneakers all the time! I have tendinitis in my right ankle, have a high arch, and am a bad overpronator. These sandals really keep my ankles from pronating, it's great support!! Whatever you do, don't wear them all day the first few times, especially if you aren't used to such arch support. These definitely have a break in period that you need to get your feet used to.  I haven't had any ankle pain with these and every day I can wear them longer. My only complaint is that the logo on the shoe turns my heel a bluish black color even after only a half hour.  Hoping it will stop after more wear, but luckily it cleans off very easily!	2015-08-07

No offence Amazon, but I didn't want to buy these here. I love my local outdoor shops and thought I'd support the small guys on this one so they don't disappear. However, I went to THREE different shops (MEC, Sojourn & Atmosphere and NONE of them had stock of kids Teva's!?!? So, I came back to trusty Amazon and there's every size and color you could want.<br /><br />The Teva's themselves are fantastic. I've worn Teva's for 3 decades and across 4 continents - I love them. They're comfortable, they're rugged, they last. So, now that my kids are off to camp and hiking in the summers it was time for their own. The kids Hurricane 3's have exactly the same support in the sole (not sure why people buy the flat cheap ones?!?) and the same great Teva construction on the straps.<br /><br />The price was reasonable considering (unlike mine), I'm going to have to replace these every year as the kids' feet get bigger and bigger.<br /><br />Overall a great purchase.

They are comfortable for the most part, but I personally found them to be too wide.  The length seems fine, but they are very loose on the sides.  I also have a different style of CD platforms, I think called &#34;Sacche&#34; that have the same problem.  Going down a size helped me a bit, but even with that smaller size there is still too much room around.	2015-08-07

They do run a little large but I think that is ok as they are WELL MADE and the rubber sole appears to help these slippers last for the long haul. My 5 yo son absolutely loves these slippers. The outer fleece is pretty rough but repels minor spills, while the inner lining is soft, warm, and cozy like momma's sheep skin slippers which were FAR more expensive. All in all, I am very seriously considering buying another pair a size larger just in case because they are that awesome.	2015-08-07

I couldn't remember what size I had previously worn and I usually wear a 9 - 9 1/2 so I ordered a size 9.  Foot bed length was perfect, straps up over the instep was perfect, but the straps were too narrow across the pinky toe to big toe.  Thought I could wear them and stretch them out but after wearing them for a few hours around the house, I couldn't take the pain anymore.  Returned and am planning to buy a size 10 instead (I'm guessing that's what I had in the first pair) and am hoping the foot bed won't be too long.  Should have listened to previous reviewers!  I wore my old pair all around the world, for full days of walking and sight-seeing and these were more comfortable than any tennis shoe that I wore!	2015-08-07

After seeing these shoes at half off	As many have touched upon, these shoes run smaller and are more of a tight fit. I purchased my first pair of Pumas 3-4 years ago and was expecting the tight fit to go away after wearing them often but it never really did. As someone who prefers more room in a shoe, it was not ideal, but they became the shoe to wear during bad weather. After seeing these shoes at half off, I could not refuse. Knowing my past experience, I ordered a little larger than normal and they are great. I get some rub on the back of my foot but as a whole they are great and very comfortable. If they have the lasting power of my previous PUMA's which I still have and wear, then this is an amazing purchase. Just remember to go up a half size. If you want a loose fit, go up even more. They will break in some. But, the fit will not change too much.	2015-08-07

I really think this bag is uniquely cute; and for that reason I would give it 4 stars. BUT: due to the white parts on the handle falling off, one in the shipping box, one on the floor as I lifted it out of the box, and one elsewhere that I was lucky to find, I had to rate it 3.  fortunately, my husband is very handy and fixed that part. More problematic is the inside lining is about 2/3 too much; It billows out, not connected to the bottom or sides and really, really gets in the way of finding anything in the bag. Now I am trying to figure out how to fix the inside lining, short of simply removing it; an option that is still being considered.  In reading the other reviews, my bag is white, not eggshell.  Lastly, empty, this bag is heavy.  Soooo.... does the &#34;unique cute&#34; factor outweigh the other problems?  You decide.....	2015-08-07

I've wore them around my house for two evenings now and they are still too tight.  Asics aren't made as good as they used to be a few years ago.  I bought a pair of the purple/titanium 379N running shoes and they are still more comfortable than the new versions.  Why did Asics try to fix something that wasn't broken?  I wish they would have left the Gel Exalt shoes the way they were.  They were fine back in the day.  I hate to, but I'm thinking of trying a new brand of shoe next time.  Sorry Asics, but you guys did that to yourselves.	2015-08-07

I want something with pockets, zippers, and versatility.  This one works perfectly for me: I carry a collapsible golf-size umbrella in this bag at all times.  There is an outer pocket that fits a smartphone.  There is an interior zip pocket that holds a variety of small &#34;must have&#34; items.  It is durable and works great as an everyday bag for work.  My only complaint is the 2 very small zip pockets on the outside that don't fit very much in them.  Even fitting lip balm takes a little bit of maneuvering.  Overall it's a very sturdy, roomy bag with carrying options (I carry it over my shoulder, haven't used the cross-body strap at all yet).	2015-08-07

In addition, the top of the slipper, over the top of the foot, seems slightly small keeping my foot from fitting all the way in unless I really cram it in, The back of the slipper doesn't hold the heel of the foot well so with the top of the shoe pressing down the slipper slowly slides forward off my foot. I don't have exceptionally large, tall, or wide feet (fairly average on all counts) so the fit on these seems slightly odd and I can only figure that maybe a 1/2 size large might fit better?<br /><br />As it is, when I can get them to stay on, they have exceptionally soft and comfortable soles for slippers. While I would not go out and run a marathon or anything like that, I do enjoy them for taking the dog for a quick stroll around the yard or walking out to the mailbox.	2015-08-07

I was a little concerned at first because of the memory foam and the Sketcher brand on a pair of boots. I questioned durability and comfort. I've been wearing them for several months and I have to say that they are awesome. The memory foam, you will know it's there as soon as you step down and with any change of position. The creases by the toe make a big difference in comfort and durability. This boot has it all. I'm skinny and these are Relaxed Fit boots, they are meant to be a little loose around the legs for people with skinny legs. However I'd recommend a different boot for skinny people. Also their was a lot of flashing on the outsole. That I didn't like.	2015-08-07

I originally ordered these too large (a size 41), thinking I needed the same size from a previous pair of Halflingers that I own in a size 41 (Grizzly Glamour style).  This style, GZ Tristan, is more true to size, so I contacted Amazon, returned and reordered in a size 40, and they fit perfectly. I have a very high instep & a history of plantar fascitis and these clogs are super comfy from the get-go with wonderful instep support. Definitely worth the investment, and much more reasonable on Amazon vs retail stores!!!	2015-08-07

They're exactly as expected in every way.  I did answer that they don't provide good arch support, but that's because they're a relatively flat insole.  They are comfortable to wear all day, but don't specifically offer molded arch support, so if that's what you're looking for, these don't have it.

They are high-tops that lace up above the ankles and support them firmly. This is a rarity to find in modern sneakers. I never got the hang of basketball so I can't rate them for that use. Not much to note in the way of arch support but then my feet aren't complaining they're too flat..	2015-08-07

I have exchanged them for an 8, hoping that they would fit, as half-sizes are not available.  This seems to be the lament of other reviewers as well.  They probably would fit a little better if they were a half-size larger, but I am going to keep them and try out this brand, as I have friends who rave about the comfort of their FitFlops and the style of the Bloom Toe Post in Pewter is quite unique.	2015-08-07

They have holes in the bottoms I'm guessing to vent but all they do is let in water. I mean half an inch of water, less than a puddle and your socks are soaked. Not to mention the star pattern of holes in the soles of the boots, they dig into your feet, they give you insoles that have a matching pattern, I threw them away due to the star shaped blisters formed in the middle of my feel. If you buy these make sure you get good thick insoles and be prepared to break them in for a couple weeks. It wouldn't hurt to get mole skin or blister pads too.	2015-08-07

These are my fave shoes for summer! The wedge is angled and gives it a more tailored appearance over the other wedges that Sanuk offers.  The wedge is great to wear with skirts and adds a nice feminine flair to your otherwise run-around clothes. I've worn these almost daily over the last month and they show no signs of wear.  I'm a heavier-set middle-aged woman who wears what she wants.  The thong and strapping are strong and having pulled or stretched or torn out of the sole despite my very active and demanding schedule.  I've worn these in the creek, long outdoor walks...I'd even sleep in them if I could!! I've only had one other flip-flop that would compete: Kino Sandals.  Best investment ever.	2015-08-07

I think Merrell hit a homerun with this shoe for those that are looking to run long distances on rugged, technical mountainous terrain. This shoes offers the perfect combination of 360* protection (including a very protective toe guard), cushion and traction without sacrificing too much feel for the terrain. The toe box is surprisingly roomy and the lacing system and upper combination allow you to dial in the fit to your liking. Took these for a 13 mile mountain run right out of the box with no issues at all. They didn't feel like any break in period is required. The 6mm drop is right in the sweet spot of what I like in a mountain running shoe. I wouldn't want to run long distances on the road in this shoe, but for shorter distances in a mixed terrain run, this shoe won't kill you on the road either. I'm very impressed by how much protection this shoe offers at &#34;only&#34; 10.4 oz. I really can't say enough good things about this shoe. I'm planning on using these as part of my rotation for an upcoming 100 mile trail run on some pretty rugged terrain along with my La Sportiva Ultra Raptors which is another excellent shoe for mountain running.	2015-08-07

When I placed the order, I was hoping that they would love this shoe, they loved the color, fit perfectly, comfort which can be worn for long hours during the day, and comfortable to work in and move around throughout the day.<br /><br />Although some people believe shoes may be too narrow, when choosing their sizes, this was ordered in wide width, and is comfortable, and does not change the appearance of the shoe. Some shoes when ordered in wide-width, tends to change the style and appearance of the shoes. It also has a great arch support within the shoe. I am pleased, and the owner of this new Clarks Men's Senner Lane Slip-On Shoe is very happy.<br /><br />The Seller described this product accurately. Clarks is a brand name that you can trust. Packing was excellent, secure, as well as shoe holders included in each shoe.  I would definitely recommend this shoe to others, as well as Amazon Customers. The delivery time was very impressive. Thanks Seller and Amazon for a great product.	2015-08-07

The turquoise color is beautiful. I will probaby be wearing them at my wedding reception once i get tired of heels. I ordered a7.5 which is my regular size and they fit perfectly. I would absolutely order another pair.	2015-08-07

I purchased the Giraffe print Women's Classic Polarized Sunglasses and they are with out a doubt my favorite sunglasses I have ever owned. I love when my package arrived in came in a really nice pouch to keep them in and they are even more gorgeous then pictured. They fit my face perfect, which many sunglasses usually don't and I love how much protection they give from the sun with the polarized lenses. The Giraffe print can also be called Tortoise Shell and has really pretty shades of brown and tan and the sunglasses are very high quality! I highly recommend everyone Women should own these and they are the perfect sunglasses that will look great on everyone! I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-07

Depends on your actual size	I wear a (true) size 10 shoe.  Had difficulty finding a properly sized slipper.  Returned one that was a 9-10 - much too small.  Figured that what I probably needed was at least a 1/2 size larger but not so large as to result in a loose heel area.  Returned a second pair that was too loose in the heel.  Size finally worked in a 9.5-10.5.  Conclusion:  Don't be mislead by reviews claiming good fits.  Depends on your actual size.  I'd try to find a pair no more than 1/2 size larger & 1/2 smaller than true size.  These Isotoners are nice slippers.  Was skeptical about the &#34;memory foam&#34; but it actually seems to work, shaping to your foot (but then sort of remaining with that shape).	2015-08-07

Came in fast and it fit true to size (7.5). The only thing I didn't like was that the material making up the calf isn't stiff enough so when wearing it it slouches down your leg a little becoming almost wrinkley. If that makes sense? It looks better when worn over jeans rather than bare leg. Overall good boot though 👍🏻	2015-08-07

This tote bag carries all my essentials for a day in the classroom:  a notepad, my 13&#34; notebook, smart phone and other small electronics, pens and pencils, water bottle and snacks.  The hand straps are long enough to allow me to carry the bag snugly under my left shoulder.  A shoulder strap to allow this bag to be worn over one shoulder is also included.<br /><br />There are several weaknesses I noted upon inspection, though.  I have two loose frays on my hand strap, weakening my hand straps at two crucial seams.  All the zippers hesitate and come undone, so I have to be careful when closing them.  The third thing I noted is that the inside is made from one nylon liner, out of which all the pockets are made.  If that nylon rips, that weakens the liner and contents will fall out of the liner and get lost in that space between liner and canvas.<br /><br />Despite the noted weaknesses, I like the design and the colors and the bag's largesse.  I just know I need to treat this with care.<br /><br />I received a free sample in exchange for a review.	2015-08-07

I have owned Skechers Go Walk and Go Run walking shoes and sneakers in the past.  All have been extremely comfortable in both the feel on the foot and the cushion on the ground.  I usually wear Converse Chuck Taylor High Tops for my everyday sneaker, but when I'm going to be on my feet all day covering miles and miles (Universal Studios, Disney World, Seaworld, etc.) my Skechers are my go to shoe/sneaker.  They have much more cushion than my Chucks, and I prefer the low tops in the intense Florida heat when walking all day.  Keep in mind that they fit smaller than other shoes that I've owned, so for instance I wear a 11 mens in the Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars, but all of my Skechers that fit the same are size 12 mens.  I highly recommend Skechers for their comfort and light weight.	2015-08-07

That said, I really cannot wear them for more than a couple hours if I'm going to be moving around much. The back cuts into my heel very firmly and takes off skin rather quickly.

I'm confident that by wearing these more frequently I can break them in, but I intend to do so a little bit at a time because I prefer having flesh on the back of my heels.	2015-08-07

I have 2 pairs that I alternate.<br /><br />I have tried countless shoes and purchased many brands.  The only brand I found to be consistently comfortable was New Balance.  For years, I was stuck in an endless cycle.  I would try on several shoes, then I would buy the pair that felt ok (not great).  Then I would eventually find the shoes uncomfortable after a week or two.  At that point, I would revert back to my New Balances.  Now, I'm really liking these Sauconys.	2015-08-07

I got them  for my class reunion. And I can't wait to wear them this weekend. The only reason I gave four stars is because the fit around the legs are very loose, if you have smaller legs. I just took them to a show repair place, (as another reviewer suggested), and had them add extra holes, so that the fit is tighter....... And Walahhhh!! #Magic! Lol! They fit perfectly now. In the pic I submitted, I had just received them back from the shoe repair shop and was trying them on. I'm in love with these shoes! I highly recommend these!

My son wears these all day every day as part of his high school uniform and they last all year long.  He likes them so much that he even wears them on the weekend from time to time.  He did mention they felt a little snug in the width, but I told him that they'd probably stretch since they're made of leather.  It's been a few days and no complaints so I'm assuming they've already stretched out.<br /><br />Note...this shoe does run a size big.  My son typically wears a 12.5 and he wears an 11 in these.  If it's your first time buying Wallabees, I'd recommend first going to a Clark's store and try them on for sizing purposes.	2015-08-07

Would give them 5 stars but there is glue easily visible where the bottom comes up and wraps the front of the toes.  I have even seen it in the marketing pics.  I would expect it from walmart shoes but for $100 to $150 for a pair that is ridiculous.  I checked my old pair of KSOs and no manufacturing issues so I know they could do it right if they wanted to.  Would give them 3 stars for this but at the end of the day toes shoes are a bit ridiculous so what does a little visible glue matter when you love the way they feel?  If they fall apart I'll send them back and update the review.	2015-08-07

I doubt I can return them now but won't spend $40 on stride rite anymore when they are supposed to be such good shoes. Very disappointed.	2015-08-07

I made life easy & shopped on Amazon. The Roper brand is a good choice for Jillian...she wore her first pair out! These boots just happen to be the colors of the Disney movie with the Ice theme, & that made them a true delight for her. She was well pleased & I was relieved that my choice was acceptable. She will get a lot of miles out of those boots before she out grows them!	2015-08-07

So when I have these rare business meetings scheduled?  I cringe, dreading the thought of having to wear heels!  But earlier this week, I wore THESE and found them to be FANTASTIC!  So so comfortable, that I could walk from the hotel to the headquarters.... from the building entrance up the stairs to the conference room... to and from the cafeteria!  So energized, so supported!  I wore these for two days in a row and had NO issues!  No blisters, no slipping-sliding, no cramping of the toes!  Highly recommend!	2015-08-07

I love these Boots, but I was just borrowing them from my friend while she was out of town. These are just about perfect, I like the leather quality and there comfortable with a couple of sole inserts. These are very wide and the opening is generous enough that I have never had to unzip them to stuff even non skinny jeans down inside the ankle. Cons: (to me)The toe being extra roomy and round makes it look like I have giant feet, a lot of the studs fell off in the back and the soles wear down to quickly for me. I'm just used to Doc Martin's and Frye boots. I don't think I will go out of my way to get a pair for myself of this exact pair but if you want a flexible and roomy boot that brings the 80's rocker look where ever you go, then I can recommend this boot.	2015-08-07

I think the plastic buttons down the middle of the sandal look cheap, so I've removed them to no detriment to the fit.  (They easily slip off,) I bought 9 W and they fit well.  I measure at 9 W on one foot and 9+W on the other foot so I would call these true to size.	2015-08-07

I'm thinking the new design of this old favorite--they added an adjustable back strap--is what's giving me problems.  It cannot be adjusted to fit snuggly and my heel doesn't feel secure.

I probably would have gone with another one if it came in Black. This one is just a tiny bit smaller, but more stylish, with plenty of pockets and compartments. And it still fits all my junk, including an iPad mini. It's hard to see in the picture, but those two pockets in the front are held closed by magnets -- pretty strong, but I wouldn't trust them with my iPhone. (I stashed my charging cables and head phones in there, and they haven't popped out so far.) One thing I've learned about ANY brand of cross-body purses: They rub on your chest and back as you move through your day and will pill your blouses and sweaters. So be careful with how your carry them when you are not wearing a jacket or coat. Otherwise, I think this is a functional bag at a reasonable price.	2015-08-07

The difference in the way my back and legs feel after a long day in these shoes versus sneakers or other less expensive nursing shoes is unbelievable.  That being said, I have been very disappointed with this specific shoe. The fit is amazing. Initially the pattern was quite pretty. However, after having worn these shoes only 3 times, the printed coating began to crack and peel off. This has left me with a pair of shoes that, while comfortable,  I no longer want to wear.  On a side note, the cute little metal tag that once read &#34;Sanita&#34; now reads &#34;anita&#34; as the letter S fell off of both shoes after having worn them only a few times.  Again, I love the brand. I only wish the quality of finish matched the quality of fit in this specific shoe.	2015-08-07

I took the dive and ordered a half size larger than I usually wear and these are spot on with lots of room for sport socks and a firm and secure fit.  First trip was a 4 mile hour on the tread mill with a good incline.  I could not ask for more and I promoted my old pair to yard work and spent 3 hours mowing the lawn in them.  Still lots of life there too after more than 3 years on the tread mill for many many miles.<br /><br />I have long sought out NBs because they were made in the U.S.  This pair was not!  I did not think that they may be foreign made.  This may account for the small sizes and the decline quality other reviewers have observed.  My next pair may not be NBs after 30 years and many pairs.	2015-08-07

When I switch purses I can just easily just pick it up from one purse and put it into the other. It only has a single compartment. The outside is made of fabric but the inside is lined with plastic. I use it to carry bobby pins, band aids, floss, USB drives, a pen, tissue pack, and a few other items. I've used it for at least three months now and it's holding up nicely. The zipper is in great shape, doesn't catch on anything, smooth glide. Super cute design and highly recommend.	2015-08-07

I think sometimes people forget when buying boots you want extra room for socks and leg warmers, or room to tuck jeans that aren't skinnies into. The foot bed has some cushion, with the extra room I can put in an insert for additional support if I want. Love the burgundy and grey color. I'm shorter 5'3'', the boots stop a few inches under my knee so there not as tall as I'd expected but its not a problem. I got my size for only $45.00 so they were a steal, I'm not sure that I'd want to have spent $100.00, if I were going to spend more I'd opt for merrells or maybe keens.	2015-08-07

It never got water on it, and it had no unusual wear.  Poor quality.	I have used these for over a month now as my 2-3 times per week running shoes.  However, I am not super strong, and after 3 weeks (about 9 wears or so) I was pulling at the laces and one of the lace holes broke, so now it laces unevenly.<br /><br />Obviously it is too late to return the shoes after so many wears, and I seldom do reviews, but I think this is a sign of very poor quality.  Again, I am not very strong, and the lace ripped right through the material.	2015-08-07

Was almost scared away by the negative customer reviews, but I was in desperate need of a good purse so I went ahead and ordered it. I'm very glad I did! While the material is a little on the thin side (it reminds me of reinforced t-shirt material), it's big enough and sturdy enough to hold all my daily items (wallet, sunglasses, glasses case, lip balm, book, etc.). Because of the material I can bunch it up and make it fit in my locker while at work. That being said, I wouldn't trust it with anything too heavy (wouldn't use it as a backpack or laptop bag), but anyone else who is on the fence about this product should really just make the leap. It's one of the best purses I've bought.	2015-08-07

I wear a 6.5 - 7 M in most shoes, but  with sandals, a 6 - 6.5 fits best. I have been on a quest to find a good fitting, comfortable flip flop for three years (since moving to FL). After buying many pairs of different brands, finally, these in size 6 turned out to be a perfect fit and are incredibly comfortable flip flops. Especially with the bit of arch support. So much easier to walk in and the arch hits in the right place on my foot. Really happy with this find. Will definitely be ordering more.	2015-08-07

I usually love ASICS, and Amazon for that matter. I have to say, I have never been so disappointed by ASICS or Amazon.<br /><br />I have a really serious pronation problem, which means that I need extra support in my shoes. I knew that ASICS have shoes that have great heel cups... little metal things inside the cushiony shoe that keep your feet from turning out of the shoe. After an ill-fated trip to the ASICS store where I was entirely ignored (I assume because I don't look like the typical runner), I did hours of research to find an ASICS shoe that had the &#34;heel clutching system&#34;. I looked on the ASICS site as well as Amazon and several others.<br /><br />My shoes showed up today, and to my surprise, the &#34;heel clutching system&#34; was no such thing. It was a mere plastic line that went around the heel and would have offered absolutely no support. The shoes were flimsy and seemed like they would break down with about one month of wear.<br /><br />ASICS did not make this clear at all, and Amazon's absolute lack of information on these shoes was entirely misleading. So, I'm returning these and re-starting the hunt to see if I can find something decent. Beware the misleading information!	2015-08-07

Long time amazon shopper, never made a review until now because I thought this product absolutely worthy. So when I shop for glasses I try to accomplish 3 things: Nice Style, Good Price, and a Polarized Lens. Usually you can only get 2 out of those 3 requests. I am an avid fisher, which is why I look for polarized, but also everything looks better when polarized, blues more blue, greens more green, etc. So I bought these for a fishing trip coming up as a cheap stylish pair. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when they showed up. They look great, the price was as cheap as you can get, they obviously were polarized, but what really stood out to me was the quality. I have owned Rayban, Fossil, D&G, Smith, Oakley... They are the same, if not more sturdy than all the other pairs that I have owned. The finish and material is top notch. Somehow these glasses filled all 3 of my priorities with an extra bonus of premium quality. Well done Apollos.	2015-08-07

I have hallux rigidus and need a shoe with a wide toe  box. This shoe, the Constant, is the widest shoe that Hoka makes. It is very light, but sturdy, and extremely comfortable. It has a slight rocker base which takes pressure off the toe. I tried the Hoka Bondi that was recommended by a podiatrist, but it was too narrow for me. Hoka gives you two insoles so you can choose the one that suits you.	2015-08-07

This Katy shoe by Riverberry is a very classy (and classic) pump.  I got the Khaki patent color which is a perfect neutral.  The heel is just the right height for a kitten heel.  The shoe fits exactly as the size indicates and I found it to be very comfortable.  I can no longer wear very high heels so the height on these heels were perfect.  I wanted something that was not flat but still elegant.  The sole of the shoe has small lines (ridges) for a non-slip surface and I was very very pleased by the fact that they included an additional pair of heel tips so that when the existing ones wear down, all you have to do is take them off and put the extra pair on.  The &#34;vamp&#34; of the shoe (where you see toe cleavage - LOL) is good also. This part of the shoe helps to keep your foot in a stable position preventing it from shifting back and forth in the shoe. If the vamp is higher you will get more support.  The vamp on this shoe shows &#34;no cleavage&#34;.  The width was good too.  The interior is synthetic but is soft and seems well constructed.  There is no odd joining of material that could rub and hurt your feet which is a godsend.<br /><br />I CHOSE THESE SHOES AND RECEIVED THEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR WEARING THEM AND PROVIDING A REAL EXPERIENCE REVIEW.  These observations and opinions are my own and are given after careful inspection and wearing.  I am very happy to add these shoes to my shoe collection.	2015-08-07

The are light-weight, and I always go with the 58mm. Be mindful that currently the flash lenses only come in a size 55mm (small), and 58mm (med), they are not offered in the 62mm (lg). Also these are mirrored lenses, so the color only appears lighter depending on the lighting, the color is darker than pictured.  If you go into Sunglass Hut you will notice while sitting on the shelves the frames are light in color (as depicted in the picture on this site), but when lying flat and/or wearing it shows the true color of the lens depending on the lighting.  Amazon.com is an authorized dealer of Raybans, I can't speak for other 3rd party vendors that may be offering similar products, so if you have reservations about a purchase from a 3rd party, I'd recommend you purchase directly from Amazon.com (shipped/sold) and/or contact RayBan directly to verify if that vendor is authorized to sell their products.	2015-08-07

If you have flat/wide/bunion feet you may have issues with the initial break-in and all-day wear. It is a necessity to wear your laces lose. Keep in mind that these shoes have very little to no arch support. I personally removed the OEM sole and use a thin more-supportive sole out of another pair of shoes. There is very little room for a thicker aftermarket sole like this one:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Powerstep-Pinnacle-Orthopedic-Insoles-Support/dp/B00DVLFQAO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1438958760&sr=8-2&keywords=powerstep+pinnacle+9<br /><br />I highly recommend this insole for almost every shoe, except this one.<br /><br />To conclude, they look outstanding, but people with wide feet will need to make minor adjustments for full-day use. Get some!	2015-08-07

They fit well and looked to hold up to hours of play so I was stoked to see these blue pair on amazon.  The black paint on the rim of the shoe came off after the first day he wore them to daycare.  I don't know if this pair was made by a different manufacturer but after a month of use they look like they are year old shoes.  I guess I need to go directly to the sketcher store to make sure I'm getting a good shoe.	2015-08-07

I've left this feedback before but the company is requesting it again, so here it is:<br /><br />Bandolinos are my favorite shoes ever!  I prefer them over Nine West, over Jimmy's, over everyone I can think of that I have a pair of, which are many.  They are comfortable, they are well-made, they are stylish and very up-to-date with so many styles of clothes.  So, they can be worn with jeans, clothes for a night out, daytime for the office - they are just, in a word - PHENOMENAL!	2015-08-07

I like these shoes as comfortable boating shoes I can get wet.

Buyer beware	Only three months and very little use, my boots began delaminating at the toes. I contacted lems to have them refund or replace the cost of the boots, but because I had tried to waterproof them with beeswax and not the otterwax they sell, they refused to do anything for me. I have read other reviews about these boots that refer to the issue of delamination as well, but thought I'd give them a chance. I would highly discourage anyone from spending so much money on a defective product. I would give these boots no stars if that was an option.	2015-08-07

Shoes were tight upon receipt, but fit perfectly after some break-in.  The ventilation in these shoes is the innovation I'd been awaiting in a business casual shoe.  No sweaty feet!  I use a standing desk most of the day and, along with an anti-fatigue mat, these feel great.  I've been wearing them for months with no regrets.  Soles don't squeak, but there's a molded logo on the sole that does click a little as you walk.  Small price to pay for an otherwise excellent pair of shoes!	2015-08-07

Help :(	These pair of shoes are the ones that I wear on my nursing clinicals and they are AMAZING. I have flat feet and the memory foam inside support and massage my soles all day. The only issue that I have with these shoes is that I have been using them only for my clinical rounds for the hospital (past 6 months)and it seems the right shoe on the inside may be a defective side. The seam has torn and I even tried to temporarily repair it with our sticky IV line tape to no avail. It's not like I'm being rough on them, I walk up and down the unit and care for my patients and even take some flights of stairs after my clinical...not running, jumping, or doing anything crazy; the print on the inside of the shoe on top of the memory foam is still there to show that I haven't been rough. I love these pair of shoes and highly recommend them, but I'm not sure who I need to contact because of this inconvenient defect. I have already tried to return them through amazon and apparently they are not up for return ability...any help would be much appreciated :(	2015-08-07

After running around to Dick's and the NIKE store he really didn't decide on a pair. I went on Amazon and I saw this pair. I thought that the colors would match all of his golf shirts and I thought it was a nice looking shoe. I ordered them without showing them to my husband and they arrived three days later. He opened them up and he loved the style of them, however I was worried that they might not fit because of another review on here about them running super small. Anyway, he wears a 10 1/2 in shoe size and they fit him perfectly. He also stated that they were very comfortable. He is very happy with them and I was happy about the price.	2015-08-07

I have pretty wide feet and a size 13, so it's usually a hassle trying to find shoes that fit comfortably. Skechers is usually my go to brand, they're great with their sizing and widths.<br />This was my first pair of Propets, I've never heard of them before. I'm happy, but not thrilled, with the fit. Like I said I ordered a size 13-3E, and it fits like a glove. They're not really too narrow, but it wouldn't hurt if they were just a tiny bit wider. It feels like the shoe is gently hugging my feet, which isn't really bad I guess but I wouldn't mind a little more wiggle room. As I said, like a glove. I'm sure after breaking them in a little bit they will be perfect.<br />They shipped from California to Pennsylvania in 4 days which is not bad at all for standard shipping. Had no problems with the order.<br /><br />My only complaints:<br />1- There is little to no arch support, the insole feels pretty much flat. If that's an issue for you, you might want to get insoles separately (or look for another shoe)<br />2- They are extremely light weight which is a good thing for comfort; but it also makes me question the overall quality. I've only had them for a week so I can't say how well-made they are or how long they will last. They're just so light weight, they don't seem very durable.	2015-08-07

They are my normal size (10D) for NB, but it's pretty roomy in the toe area.

Then I noticed a scuff on the outer toe of the right shoe, though they appear to have never been worn.

However, as with any designers, you often pay for the &#34;ego/brand factor&#34; - This is probably the case here as well but its well worth it. I do need readers at times and so far I was OK with the cheapy ones you get at for a fraction of the price.<br />Boy was I wrong to believe there was nothing to be re-engineered here. Yes, I can get 60 pairs of cheap readers for the price of these, but thats like comparing a cubic zirconia with a top grade flawless diamond.<br />These glasses are a cut above<br />1. Super light - I mean super light - you barely feel you are holding them in your hands or sitting on your nose.<br />2. Perfect angle and positioning - Acts very much like the bottom part of bifocals.<br />3. Lenses are super clear and about a tenth of the thickness of cheap readers and 100X sharper.<br />4. They are very flexible<br />5. They look great<br /><br />-  also comes with Porsche design authentic card<br /><br />Not worth taking a star away but maybe worth mentioning:<br /><br />1. They are a bit darker than the pictures here suggest - with light coming thru them they get brighter red, but expect deeper red overall.<br />2. Packaging and case are rather cheap compared to the the glasses themselves. Not a big deal as I doubt I would ever use the case or really care of packaging, but you may be somewhat disappointed at first as I was - until you wear them.	2015-08-07

I find them very comfortable to wear on the tile over concrete and new carpeting. Sometimes I forget to switch to my pool slides when going outside, but that's my problem. I'm very happy with the adidas slides in comfort, fit and suitability for my purpose. I would wear them as pool or locker room shoes as well, or even casual outdoor wear.

I ended up returning them for a size larger.  The next size up could be a tad LONGER but the width, coziness, and quality led me to keep them. I work from home and often have the slippers on all day long, even in the summer as they are that comfortable. Because I wear them everywhere around our property, I tend to wash them about every two weeks. I was them with a special detergent I received while wearing another &#34;CLOUD&#34; slipper which sadly went out of business and they are holding up just great. That being said, the wool will break down. I use a gentle brush to brush the wool back up to give it that little bit of squishiness that also helps keep your toes toasty, or cool. I'm thoroughly please with these slippers, though I do wish they ran a little larger, hence the 4 vs 5 star rating.	2015-08-07

I love the Livie and Luca shoes however in the description it does not clarify what type of sole the shoe has. This will make a difference in the LIVIE and LUCA sizing chart. Please visit the website of Livie and Luca before ordering, especially if you have ordered their shoes in the past. I thought I had ordered the exact same thing from last year in a different size until it didn't fit. According to LIVIE and LUCA website, the sole will change the size! I ordered what is called a TRACKER sole on it last year and it runs big so I knew she was in a 12 last year, she would fit a 13 now. Nope. The sole is different making this shoe feel like a 12.  Now I have to return 2 pairs of shoes and search for a tracker sole.	2015-08-07

I bought these boots and have been buying zip boots like these for over five years. I love the fact that I can just zip up and go. With this brand of boots, now I have to zip, lace, and tie these boots because of a design flaw. The top two lacing points do not have eyelets but cheap hooks. When you unzip, the boots become unlaced from the looseness created when you unzip.<br /><br />These boots have the potential of being great boots but now I have to zip, lace and tie. This defeats the whole purpose of buying zip up boots to avoid having to lace up and tie your boots. The person that designed these boots obviously never wore them to understand this issue I have described.	2015-08-07

Just bought my 4th pair ever; this is my all-time favorite shoe and I wear them as an every day sneaker. Of course, they are great for indoor soccer/futsal as well ;).<br /><br />Expect the fit to be tight at first: because they are kangaroo leather, they will stretch out. They will also become way more soft, supple, and they will conform to the shape of your foot.<br /><br />Ladies, these are great for a woman's foot too. I have narrow feet and high arches, and these work just great.

Per other reviews I ordered a half size down and the fit was right on. They look good, should hold up well and my wife likes them because they don't track much dirt and mud into the house. My only disappointment, and it's fairly important to me, is that the insole doesn't seem to be removable. Like most footwear, they don't have adequate support for my feet. So, I usually replace the insoles. Not with these. If I had known I would either have ordered a larger size to add an insole or not purchased them. My mistake. We'll see how my feet feel after a couple of 16 hour days.	2015-08-07

I bought these for just casual wear, no running, no gym time, just me and my shoes for going to the store/friends house/eating, and other normal people things. They fit comfortable around the sides and back of my foot, but after I walk for more than a few hours in them, the bottoms of my feet start to hurt. I have medium-low arches in my feet and these shoes don't have much forgiveness when it comes to supporting your foot. I have a pair of Brooks that I use to run it, but I would never use these to do any kind of running/hiking/training.<br /><br />I won't buy these shoes again. Probably go back to my old ways with Nike.	2015-08-07

I love wearing these shoes, but I only had them 5 days before the rubber on one shoe started to peel off. I glued it on and it was not a big deal.

This post is pretty long so for those who do not wish to read my full review here is the overview. Long story short they are painful and uncomfortable. I ordered these in my normal shoe size and they run a little narrower than most shoes. I wore them for one shift at work (8-9 hour shift that day) about an hour after wearing them my feet started to hurt and I figured it was just because I didn't get a chance to break them in yet. Well by the half way mark I could barely walk they hurt so bad at the end of my shift I took them off as soon as I got in my car and notice I got a few blisters on my heels. The next day I couldn't walk so I wore different shoes that are not allowed for my uniform which was fine I knew my boss would be ok with it when I explained the shoe problem. I spent most of the day limping around because my feet hurt so bad still. Gave my feet a break for about a week and tried them again. I took them off after 20 minutes because I felt my foot tightening up again. So for the long post. But I do not recommend these.	2015-08-07

Shoes fit as I expected and are very comfortable but they did not last at all.  I bought them 3 months ago, wore them maybe once a week...not even a dozen times and only for casual wear not for running and the fabric is tearing on the sides and over the toes.  I have at least a half dozen pairs of shoes so I never wear the same shoes more than once a week.  I am extremely disappointed since I cannot return the product to Amazon and buy a lot of stuff through Amazon but there was only a 30 day window to return the product.  I will definitely think twice about ordering shoes again since they do not back the quality of the shoe!  :-(	2015-08-07

Some of the pockets are so small they are nearly unusuable.  also, the liner keeps coming out when you pull stuff out of the pockets, so you have to shove the liner back in which gets very annoying. otherwise, it's a decent purse for the price.	2015-08-07

I guess the picture of the controller before purchase had me hooked maybe steady and even placing is not a strong area for me & the  part for the shape button pad didn't fit either the buttons got stuck under the skin and will mess up controller.

So buying this used from Amazon is still the way to go! I ended up getting a cable with mine for less the the price of a cable?! Keep your eyes out for a used one and wait .<br />Ok as for the game itself I've had both ps3 versions and now the ps4. lets just say the 2014 was a great addition to the ps3 but on the ps4 is it worth it?? For full price hell no !! not if you have it on ps3 or better yet your computer.. but it all depends you still use that ps3?, I don't use my ps3 anymore,, so there my guitar sat,, I had to buy it more or less to keep myself practicing but the game is like version 1.4 compared to the ps3 version being like 2.0 in its day if that makes any sense. Not really Rocksmith's fault  but the lag can be a deal breaker and  most people are going to get lag Because the ps4 has eliminated the ideal audio set up. However if you have a mix amp or some RCA components using the optics with some nice headphones (dt990's work well)  its pretty dang good.<br />I'm sad to see nothing new added for the ps4 version no extra songs that i'm aware of out of the box no new mini game, modes nothing.. not sure if this is just me but my unlock bonuses from softy didn't transfer either so if you had stuff unlocked or just unlocked anything in general your starting all over from scratch.. last I checked it wasn't 2014 anymore so why are you charging so much for this port Softy?? this is just typical of most of the game makers these days... buy used vote with your dollars.	2015-08-07
US	42256790	RQW2T3J5KRODU	B00E35C4LQ	32583123	Formula One 2013	Video Games	3	1	2	N	N	You don't play this game, it is more like watching a documentary	Playing F1 2013 I was struck by several contradicting qualities.  The graphics are quite outstanding for 360.  The racing model is great.  Like other Codemasters racing games, the AI of computer drivers is very satisfying.  There are lots of modes and content.<br /><br />At the same time, the difficulty and learning curve is unreal.  It is a bit like Dark Souls in that regard.  Even playing on the lowest settings took me quite a while to finish races in the upper half of the cars.  Also, there is a ton of unexplained things in the game.  These are things that F1 fans would know, but if you are a layman or have no experience with F1 it is virtually impossible to figure out.<br />*Prime vs option tires.<br />*&#34;The guy behind you is running full revs&#34;<br />*Some cars are much faster than others, but the game doesn't give you car stats like in Gran Turismo or Forza<br /><br />What made it even tougher to figure out is that I got this game free with the &#34;games with gold&#34; promotion, so no user manual.<br /><br />I posted on numerous forums questions on these and other topics.  After about 30 hours of racing I am now mid-pack with Red Bull, who is supposedly the fastest car.  This is on the second lowest difficulty setting.<br /><br />Probably a 5 star game if are an F1 fan, but virtually impossible to a newbie, especially if you don't have tons of patience.  I can't say it has been much fun.  But I did learn a lot about the F1 sport.  So it felt like watching a good documentary.<br /><br />Lastly, I picked up an official MS wireless force feedback wheel (cheap on Craiglist) and it works pretty well.  If you go on youtube and search for AOR fisi you will see some incredible league racing.  Some of the world class racers like TRL limitless do fine with a standard pad.  So I don't think the control method will determine your success.  It's just a matter of logging tons and tons and tons of hours of practice in this game.  Learn every inch of every track, andperhaps give up other videogames for a while and focus.	2015-08-07

I've literally never posted a bad review about ANYTHING - but these headphones are just terrible. The sound quality is great and that is the only reason why I gave one star, other than that the headphones are cheaply made. I first ordered the headphones and 1 day before my warranty was up the headphones cracked on the left side below the band (same side as the microphone). I am very careful with my electronics and handle everything very tenderly. I barely had to adjust them because I have a fairly small head.<br />Fortunately, Amazon sent me a new pair (and very quickly at that!) well before you know it, it cracked in the SAME EXACT SPOT, the screws in the inside came loose making the left side of the headphone just dangle by the wire, unfortunately I'm now a couple weeks past the warranty period and cannot get them replaced. I am out of $100 dollars and have to purchase a new headset. I've never in my life had a headset just crack. I am livid. I reached out to SkullCandy - and no response.

The bit fits in a standard sized multi-headed/bit screwdriver, it will not fit into most precision screwdrivers as they are too small to accept the bit.

It is the one of the slim editions so it is not able to play older systems games, but it runs great. When I bought this I was worried about frequent freezing because of it being a slim model, but the only games that froze in it was Battlefield 3 and 4 because of battlefield's servers. Only once has it froze on its own reason, but of course the system had been on for 14 hours straight playing Skyrim. I do not have any problems with it over heating, I made sure to put it where it is able to breathe well. It streams Netflix and Hulu better than my LG Smart TV. I am very satisfied with my purchase.	2015-08-07

They have a new system with weapons... So u just buy me with money (the money you get from killing people, capturing flags etc.) it really sucks that you have to buy a weapon for both robbers and the police even though it's under the same class...

I can clearly say, that today almost 20 years later, the appeal of this game is almost entirely nostalgia. However I cannot separate myself from nostalgia, so I cannot give this anything less than five stars. If you remember this game fondly from your past, then seek it out, you'll likely remember each scene vividly. If you are going into this thinking you want a light gun game for the PC, turn away now.

Kinda of short for my taste, was able to beat it less than 30 hrs i believe with a little of the side stuff.  World is big for you to roam, though the &#34;nemesis&#34; system is a great idea, there are some bugs like taking a long time for captains to replenish.  After reading forms they say you have to go around looking for them as they are not truly dead, but i dont remember what they look like, so i just kill as many as I can w/ a head explosion hopping to get a new person instead of them healing up and showing up later after i have advance the time 20 times.<br /><br />Game mechanics take a little getting used to, as there are a few things that require you to us two buttons at the same time, but other than that it's pretty straight forward.<br />Graphics is great.<br />Game play is nice, straight forward.  Though you will have to find a &#34;ride&#34; to get to a few places if you dont feel like jumping over rocks or there are non to do so.<br />Story line is ehh, pretty straight forward.  I found my self playing around the map and dueling the captains more then caring for the story line.<br /><br />Overall it's a good game, not worth the full price in my book, glad I bought it when it for less than $20.

So, after 4 hours of actually playing the game, how does it stack up in my opinion?<br /><br />Visuals: Like past titles, Arkham Knight utilizes an updated Unreal Engine, and it is very easy on the eyes.

I don't have a gaming computer, just a very small ram computer I use for my college classes but the game runs very smoothly on it. It is a multiplayer game so it was really fun to play with my daughter and husband. There are lots of puzzles and challenges in which really make kids have to think, it had a lot more opportunity for learning than I imagined it would.<br /><br />The games runs along the same story line as Shrek Forever After. My daughter really loves this game, and its fun not just for younger kids but for the whole family. Myself along with my husband enjoyed it and had a lot of laughs.	2015-08-07

US	18445354	R3US9KXRASWEYL	B000GIXIPK	648906699	Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin	Video Games	5	4	4	N	Y	My personal favorite Castlevania game!	Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin was generally well received, but I would personally go as far as to say it's my very favorite game released in the series.<br /><br />First of all, you control two characters instead of just one and alternate between the two. Though this concept has the potential to be clunky and awkward, this game does it so smoothly that it's truly a fun feature and not a cumbersome one.<br /><br />Then there is the fact that this game is a whip-wielding adventure. Personally, I think that whips as weapons are one of the really cool things about the Castlevania series, and yet several games do not use them (like Symphony of the Night, though it's an excellent game, has no whips equitable to Alucard). Jonathan can equip whips, and also a large variety of other weapons if you prefer something else. Charlotte on the other hand has books that swords pop out of when she opens them (how cool is that?!).<br /><br />The Castleroid theme of having many variables is certainly preserved here despite a very classic assortment of enemies and environments being utilized. The story line continues that of Castlevania: Bloodlines for the Sega Genesis (a great game!) and therefor is tied with the Bram Stoker novel, which is another cool aspect of this game. The difficulty of the game, while not as hard as other games in the series, is more difficult than Symphony of the Night or Dawn of Sorrow. Some of the enemies are reused from earlier games, and while some don't like this, I think it successfully gives the classic Castlevania feel. The large assort of sub-weapons is another plus. You can unlock a game mode where you play as Richter Belmont and Maria from Rondo of Blood too, giving the game a very large replay value.<br /><br />As far as the graphics and sound, both are very impressive. It's hard for me to think of anything I did not like about this game. I'm so glad to own it!	2015-08-07

The battery lasts a long time, and you can play for hours on end. It also charges rather quickly.<br /><br />The game catalog is a bit mixed. There are many more games available in Asian countries than there are in the US which is a bit disappointing, and many retailers do not carry physical copies of games anymore. That said, the games that are available are all very fun and there are a number of titles out there that will give you hours and hours of play.<br /><br />My ONE COMPLAINT is the memory system. Sony uses a proprietary memory card for this system, not an SD card. That means you can only buy Sony branded cards which are ridiculously over priced for the amount of memory you get. This especially sucks because Sony has decided to shift game distribution towards it's digital store in North America, making memory cards more vital.	2015-08-07

I'll start off by saying I usually find myself on the more lenient side when it comes to assessing the quality of something I order. If I had paid full price for this I would be infuriated. The quality just doesn't justify the price.<br /><br />So, to walk you through it:<br />I open the package, set the headphones to the side, they felt very poorly made but whatever, doubtful anyone bought this for the headphones. Ahah! I grab the cloth and clean the screen, then proceed to put the screen protector on. If you're looking to keep your screen from being scratched, this will work fine and is very easy to put on. Memory card is 4gb, so it's small, yeah yeah, but it comes with a cool case for games and the card! I try to put the card in the case and it goes in and comes out with alarming difficulty, I feel in the near future either card or case will end up breaking but that just might be me. So....the case, ahhh.....well..... It's  essentially a pouch to put your vita in so you can put that pouch in another pouch. Perhaps I am being unreasonable in thinking I could somehow buy this and use it for travel. Silly me, I now realize this was never meant for travel, or kids, or adults for that matter, this was meant for people with far too much money and far too little time to look for a better deal. Well at least it came with headphones I could use! I thought to myself. WRONG! Left ear bud didn't even work! So I double check to see if this actually has Sony's stamp of approval and sure enough it does. So, like the parent who bought this for their A student only to see all D's on their next report card. I'm not mad Sony, Just dissapointed.	2015-08-07

I have 5 kids and this is one of their all time favorite Wii games.  We had borrowed it from our library several times and finally decided to buy it because I hated having to wait for it to become available again.  This is a great game that my kids ages 12 down to 5 all love and can play.  There are various components of the game and activities that span the seasons of the year.  There is an open world feel to the game where you can explore and find some hidden things you didn't know about and they are also missions that need to be completed, tasks to accomplish, and mini games that keep my kids entertained and wanting more.<br /><br />My kids love this game and even though I've only played it with them a few times, I have really enjoyed it as well.  5 Stars	2015-08-07

However this one it's the worst one I have played in a while. The AI is extremely aggressive and wants to wreck you in every corner, also when come off of pit road to merge onto the track they just cut right in front of you sometimes. In addition, some of the cars that are supposed to run in the back are somehow up front in some of the races (Cole Whitt finishing in 8th at Kansas? Not very realistic.). Most other aspects are fine but R&D in career mode can get tedious unless you enter a cheat code in the options menu. And because the AI is aggressive you'll have a tough time of it trying to win the Sprint Cup in career mode even on 30-40% difficulty. Do yourselves a favor and get on on the NASCAR games on PS2. If you have to get a NASCAR game for the PS3 then this is for you but Id suggest Gran Turismo or go for one of the F1 or Grid games.	2015-08-07

Used it for about a week and not a single game file has corrupted. If you're looking for a 1019 block GC memory card but don't want to shell out the $20, this is what you're looking for. NOTE: As other buyers state, this item say's Wii memory card on the packaging it comes in. This memory card is actually for a system called Nintendo GameCube. It does work on the Wii but only to save Nintendo Gamecube Games. If you're looking for a Wii memory card for Wii games, that would an SD card you're looking for.	2015-08-07

The only reason for the three stars is for the graphics, customization, investigative missions and maybe for the storyline, even if I didn't end the whole game. It lags a lot, the running sensibility like the previous assassins' screed doesn't exist anymore,so if you gonna run, you gonna run fast. Fighting skills got a little bit lame and hard as hell. I definitely prefer assassin's creed 4 black flag for everything it has.	2015-08-07

I've used this controller primarily for first person shooters and adventure games. I personally have slightly smaller hands<br /><br />Now, the pros of the controller:<br />+The controller is as comfortable as the standard Microsoft Xbox 360 controller<br />+It has held up extremely well, with all buttons still functioning perfectly after a year<br />+The cord is a great, long length, and detaches when something hits it (like someone walking into it)<br />+At the time of purchase, it was significantly cheaper than the standard wired controller<br /><br />The cons:<br />-The only con is that for some people with larger hands, the controller may be uncomfortable after a long playing session, but I am unable to test this	2015-08-07

Installing updates, numerous restarts, wired/wireless internet connection, shield controller plugged in/wireless, xbox 360 controller plugged in, different TVs, re-installing Geforce experience, changing router settings...    Just a nightmare.    I'm now able to stream internet video and play laggy GRID games. The lag isn't terrible but it's enough that I'd rather play the game on my computer anytime I wanted a satisfying gaming experience-- which means the GRID games are basically useless.    But that's not even the worst problem. PC to Shield wifi game streaming doesn't work. When any game starts, the controller becomes response-less, except for the home button. I've googled the problem and NVIDIA has no solution that works.    So yeah, this thing can stream video really well, and that's about it. Which is everything a Chromecast can do.    Save your money and put it towards something useful like PC upgrades. If you want play games in your living room, buy a long HDMI cable and run it to your TV. You'll have a much more satisfying experience.	2015-08-07

Ok so this review is written from a newcomer's perspective to the series. There are I believe seven games in the series not including multiple remakes of almost all of them (this very game being a remake itself). I had heard the name of the series maybe a handful of times before picking this title up but I had played the few games that I had bought the vita for and heard some friends praise this title like it was a piece of radioactive, superpower giving alien s*** found on a fallen meteorite.<br /><br />Upon reading various other amazon reviews they tend to structure it going over gameplay, story, music and graphics, each with it's own respective paragraph and rating. Which is then ended by an overall rating. This seems a little to structured to me for an Amazon review from a random fellow whose opinion may be closest related to a chimpanzee who is asked to describe the steps of a salsa dance with the closest thing he can muster up that resembles human speech. But since that seems to be what people read and pay attention to I will attempt to do so... But I may just give up and get back to actually doing work while I'm on the clock.<br /><br />Music 4.34/5.23<br />The music is some of the best I have heard in all of my years of foaming over gaming music. In a beautiful harmony of violins, harps, and crescendos from a bass organ..... ohh who am I kidding. I know absolutely nothing about game music unfortunately. It's nice, that's about it. I like the noises and it adds to the game and is not subtracting to the experience, are you happy? If there are any music snobs out their who are super particular, read another review.<br /><br />Story: Something like a baby from Kate Upton and Ryan Gosling. (that means flipping beautiful)<br />Now this isn't a mainly story driven game such as a Danganronpa or Virtues Last Reward. However, compared to many of the rpgs I have played it the past whose stories get over complicated or try to make you care to much this game does an amazing job of keeping the story as important, and intriguing without overdoing it. Like I said previously it starts off with a boy (young man?) named Adol who has amnesia and in a search to figure out what happens to him he is tasked to map out the unexplored forest. Throughout his journey he makes new (or old?) friends who join him on his journey and unravel a much larger plot in a humanity fighting for it's free will. Some of the best villans are ones whose side you can understand even if they are going to terrible lengths to try and achieve them which is just what this game does. I won't say to much but there are memories spread throughout the game that are not overly difficult to find which provide further optional backstory and even stat boosts for those who want to try and get the full story.<br />So to recap the story ramble. It gets surprisingly interesting after the opening bit but doesn't get to convoluted or long winded. Ohhh and there are some quite humorous moments from character interactions that spawn from your dialogue choices.<br /><br />Graphics: on a scale of the Skeleton of Cadavra to Tron remake, it's probably a Legend of Hercules 3D.....<br />So are these the best graphics you will find on the system? No. But did I notice a single problem? Nope. They are very well done simple graphics, it looks great but there's nothing that will make you gasp and shed tears from the mosaic of colors before you. The areas are all very well done and I only noticed framerate drops on a few occasion when I was fighting a particularly large group of enemies or when the enemies and I happened to be using our special moves at the exact same time, but it was rare enough for me not to care. Even the entire game is about basically exploring a forest, you will travel through snowy caves, through ruins under rivers, shortly up a volcano, across a rocky battlefield, and throughout various towns.  It all looks varied enough to keep you interested throughout the game with out growing bored.<br /><br />Gameplay: As satisfying as rubbing a stick of butter across Chris Hemsworth's abs until it melts dripping onto a freshly popped bowl of popcorn.(Very satisfying for those who have yet to experience that)<br /><br />So this is what makes the game so amazing. It is what makes it my favorite game on the Vita (out of the 20ish games I have played including P4G... I know, sue me)<br />So the game is broken down into a dodge button, a guard button and an attack button... yep that's it... but it's glorious. You can have up to three of the seven party members that you acquire throughout the game in your active party at any time, switching freely between them. Each character has a different type of weapon, with the various monsters having weaknesses to those types. Throughout the game you will acquire stronger weapons with which you can upgrade to add effects such as a chance to poison the enemy. Enemies in the game drop materials which you can sell or craft or combine into stronger materials. There are a large variety of accessories you can craft or find, which range from upgrading stats, to making your special abilities cost less sp to use. Speaking of special attacks, whenever you attack enemies in the game or get an aerial combo etc, you gain sp. You can then use your sp to use one of about 8-12 unique abilities per character. The more you use the ability, the more it levels up which adds on more effects. It's pretty dope.<br />Moving onto bosses, the bosses are very well designed which require you to actually work to beat them without using all your money on healing and reviving items. Especially on the harder difficulties, you have to learn each bosses attacks and learn how to dodge and guard against them pretty quickly. It is challenging without being unreasonable even on Nightmare, I won't go to much into the actually bosses because a good little amount of them are at least somewhat important to parts of the story (and my employers keep 'popping in' so I need to wrap this convoluted rant up).<br />There are side quests which are great and can be humorous such as helping out a hungover giant hamster. It has a new game+ which carries over you level (take that Nightmare mode!) and you can play through a boss rush. There's explorations, and rewards for doing so, fun little puzzles, a strategic game play that mixes a rationing of special abilities with blocking and dodging about the map more then Bill Cosby dodges questions. Basically a lot of good stuff.... Like better then what SnoopDog has... anywhoozles buy the game now..

Halo Combat Evolved: is probably the best fps I own on the original xbox. There is a lot of history with the game  which I think many games today have lost.

I am displeased with JL Overstock LLC company.  First of all the clips that hold the disk inside were broken. When my son took it out of the package we could hear rattling inside the case. I should have sent it back then, and not open it, but my son was excited about the game arriving. I did mention the broken clips in the original reason description on amazon why I was returning the disk.  When I tried to down load the disk the images like a tutorial of what was on the game played while it was downloading the software.  After it had download the ride package, the water park package it started acting up when it was downloading the animal section. A error message pop up with a number code and to contact support.  There is no number to call you can only e-mail and wait for support to e-mail you back.  Bottom line the disk end up being corrupt. I tried a second laptop with a different OS which is listed on the software Windows XP, same scenario happens. I request to return the CD. Mark from JL Overstock representative who was not nice sent me a e-mail.  Basically Mark  the rep represented the company unworthy. I first didn’t know what OS was so I looked it up and follow the instruction to find out what the first laptop was and it was a newer Windows 8, but the second laptop is a Toshiba With Windows XP. Both don’t work same error as I describe above happens.  I wanted to return it, and go back to amazon and select the download option instead of the CD, but now that I cannot return the product I rather not buy the Rollercoster Tycoon products ever and nothing from JL Overstock as well. If the product worked the tutorial looked pretty cool with all the features added to that version, and sad that it didn’t work on my Windows XP laptop.  I am a loyal customer to Amazon, but the experience has made me rethink buying third party items off of Amazon.	2015-08-07

The story is awesome.  I felt that there were less enjoyable and amusing characters this time around.  I mean Gundham was pretty useless and boring character.  This time the ultimate titles were meh, ultimate breeder, mechanic...etc.  The worst part of this game is that this time they went totally crazy with the trial games you had to play. Its like the first one on roids.  So i found myself really annoyed of parts of the trials because of that.  And some of the evidence you had to use was so vaguely connected to a phrase or statement. But still I really enjoyed the game since story is amazing and the killings are very interesting.	2015-08-07

My son put these hunks of plastic called amiibos on his wish list for Christmas 2014.  Mario is his favorite Nintendo character, so Mario had to be acquired. Since then, he and I have bonded over the treasure hunt that is Amiibo. From the ones that are his favorite characters to the ones he wants mostly because they're &#34;rare&#34;...we have spent endless hours chatting Amiibo, and trekking about in search of Amiibo. Thanks, Nintendo.  My son loves the game enhancement, and I love speaking his language at least some of the time.	2015-08-07

[1] g) &#34;Warranty Period&#34; for Xbox One means 1 year from the date You purchased it; and for Accessories, means 90 days from the date You purchased it.  (Source: Microsoft)<br /><br />Admittedly, I watch something like 3 BR movies a week, although I don’t use the console for gaming because I’m not that impressed with the selection when compared to the 360.  Now - 14 months after purchase the BR-Drive has lost its’ mind, stuttering and grinding into oblivion.  Service Center wants $115 to fix it.  Amusing.  That’s 25% the value with no guarantees.<br /><br />The plasma TV that I bought when the 360 came out was in its’ time the largest model available, 42-inch diagonal @ 1080i.  XBox 360 runs it like a champ, however the XBox One can’t sync and my $2400 investment is downgraded to 720p which is definitely noticeable.  I realize today that the TV could be replaced (and have looked at the highly impressive UDH/4K which are a lot less coin) but why bother when the XBox One is maxed out at 1080p?  My PC can do better!<br /><br />The settings on the One have less fidelity than the 360.  My Avatar has less features; I use the 360 to update it instead.  What’s with that?<br /><br />The truth is I’m on my 3rd 360 console as well which means these guys making consoles are fleecing us with their shoddy engineering and corner cutting.  I can repair the 360 on my own and have.  Not the same on the One.<br /><br />Speaking from experience, I’m a veteran hardware/software engineer; I’ve worked at Microsoft for 2 decades and naturally have a lot of respect for many their projects.  I also know how to design and build consumer products.  It's a tough call but if I had to make the purchase over again, I wouldn’t.<br /><br />My point:  Imagine - If this was a car or refrigerator that broke down every year and cost you 25% of value each time, tell me - would you accept that?  Like Windows 8.1, the XBox One was flawed when conceived; half-baked with promise that actually delivers less, and not worth the value.<br /><br />That it - I’m taking another star away.	2015-08-07

US	40751777	R3RRWLI081ZVAA	B00HGLLRV2	954192590	inFAMOUS Second Son - PlayStation 4	Video Games	4	0	0	N	N	Smoke and Light	Infamous Second Son continues the evolution of the Infamous series leaving behind the protagonist from the first two games, Cole, and moving on to a pacific northwest hipster type named Delsin. It follows the same basic premise of an unwitting conduit that must rise to a challenge through either becoming essentially a superhero or a supervillain, but the game feels more immature than the previous two. Being on the PS4 it’s much better looking than the two PS3 games, and there is a wider array of powers than in the previous games. But at the same time the main character is foolhardy to the point where luck feels like it must come into play in the journey and it can feel awkward going down the infamous path. The cast of supporting characters and villains feel like a troupe of characters that would be rolled out for a B-movie follow up to a blockbuster and while there’s a greater variety of powers than in previous games, the odds are you will probably only end up utilizing one the majority of the time.   The game opens to a world where conduits are now illegals called bioterrorists who are captured and detained by an organization called the D.U.P. which is run by a conduit and has an army of soldiers with basic conduit powers. Delsin comes into play when three conduits escape and after an encounter with one Delsin discovers he’s actually a powers leach, if you will, able to replicate the powers of any conduit he comes in physical contact with. About a half hour into the game you find yourself on your way to Seattle to battle the D.U.P. and gain more powers.   The world itself is well done, and feels alive. Seattle is a large sandbox area broken in two. You immediately have access to the first half of the city and later unlock the second half. It is a prototypical sandbox game in that there are numerous things to be done around the city along with the main story and side missions. As you first enter the city the D.U.P. controls all the districts and as you undertake missions and complete world events you slowly push the D.U.P. out of districts and are able to move about more freely. While there is a large amount of side content the majority is mostly the same. Destroy a checkpoint here, and there, and there. Destroy a camera here, and there. Spray paint here, and there. You get the picture.   The graphics are solid and the artistic direction of the game is appealing. It’s always a pleasure to move around the city looking around. There are plenty of sounds and the voice acting is well done. From a presentation perspective the game is always pleasant and feels vibrant and alive. There are enough random citizens walking around and other every day things going on that you feel like you're in an actual city. Seattle isn't a barren cityscape with only enough characters to move along the plot.   Things aren’t as well done with the overall plot and the cast of characters. Infamous Second Son is through and through a AAA game and there’s never any doubt about that, but it almost feels like a low budget sequel in some respects. Not in the special effects or technical side, but in the cheesy plot or certain supporting characters. It would be like firing all the expensive actors from the original to save money and replacing them with less believable characters and moving the setting to a different city. Delsin feels alright as a foolhardy hero lucking his way toward victory, but seems out of place as an infamous character. As someone so concerned with helping the folks back home it seems out of place for him to be gunning for death and destruction. There isn't the &#34;for the greater good&#34; vibe Cole gave off in the first two games but rather a more blatant &#34;I'm out to kill&#34; theme to an Infamous Delsin. The further into the game the less the primary villain, Augustine, is believable. Other than Delsin’s older brother, Rggie, all the recurring characters feel like they were put in to appeal to teenagers. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with games geared toward teenagers. But it’s not what the first two games felt like. They felt adult. They felt mature. It would be like Grand Theft Auto dropping the swearing and violence and becoming pseudo-family friendly. There’s nothing wrong with a game like that, but it’s not what the series has been or I would have expected going in.   The game can either be a longer game or a shorter game depending on how you play. Playing on expert my first time through and making sure I did everything took a while. Going through the second time it was fairly short playing on easy ignoring content I didn’t need to do. I don’t ever see myself going back for a third run. While there’s a lot of side content it’s the same from game to game and not very involved. Two times through, once for hero and once for infamous, is probably all the life the game will have, but it’s still a fairly lengthy game.   Infamous Second Son is worth playing. As a sandbox game it’s as good as any of the previous iterations if not better. The plot and supporting cast aren’t as good, but the gameplay is still great and varied. It won’t blow you away. It’s a fun way to kill time and I mostly enjoyed it from start to finish. It’s a solid, not amazing, follow up that is in some ways better and in some ways worse than the two games that proceeded it.	2015-08-07

Now with the Vita, owning games digitally is becoming more and more popular. Why carry around 20 boxes and possibly lose them when you can switch back and forth between games directly on your Vita? Quite a few games (especially if you are an indie gamer fan) go digital only and you cannot play them unless you download them to your Vita. To add on to that, if you are a Playstation plus member you are getting at least two (if not more for cross-buys) digital Vita games per month, Now with this information, you will see the the laughably small memory card that ships with Vitas will soon fill up which means you have to constantly delete games any time you want a new game.  This is a large memory card that will let you have a good sized library of games before it gets full. I believe the only bigger size is a 64gb which is more memory space per cent but you probably won;'t need that much space as an average gamer.<br />If you plan on using your Vita extensively, you will be needing an upgrade in memory and this would be my recommended size.	2015-08-07

This is a good game, but be forewarned that it does have some bugs that you need to take care of before you can enjoy it. Some of these are taken care of by patches released by the software developer, but that still didn't clear all the issues for me. I had to download the demo and replace a couple of files with the demo ones before it worked for me. The demo can be found at http://www.gamewatcher.com/. The files I replaced were &#34;Data2.rda&#34; and &#34;Benchmark&#34;. I got error messages for these files when I installed-yours may vary.

US	10519955	R3VO43E98BBTEI	B00KOOUVNI	544013994	Mortal Kombat X	Video Games	5	1	1	N	Y	I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes fighting games, and can tolerate large amounts of gore.	This is easily the best fighting game that I have ever played.  Though I admit that I am not a connoisseur of fighting games, it is very clear that this game is high quality.  The expected features are fantastic.  The dynamics to the combat styles, the characters, the environments, and the fatalities are top notch.  It took me 3 months of hard core playing for the novelty to finally wear off.  Each character has 3 different fighting styles, which makes it harder to master any given character offensively, and even more difficult to master defending against the character.  The game visuals are stunning, and the multitude of dialogue between characters the start of a match is amusing.  Beyond the fighting, the game is packed with all kinds of additional features, including the Krypt (where bonus features are accessed) which is a mini-game onto itself.  All of the classic battle modes are present, including test your might. And just when regular combat is getting stale, test your luck matches extend the entertainment value of the game for at least another month.  Furthermore, the faction wars and living tower features of the game makes it so that you always have something to work for.  I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes fighting games, and can tolerate large amounts of gore.	2015-08-07

I bought Far Cry 4 when it was marked down to $20, and hated it. I don't think I'll be making that mistake again with Far Cry 5. Ubi-Soft never can just make a game simple! You can't just climb a tower, you have to find the one route up a mountain to get to a tower, then, you have to walk a circle around it to figure out how to get to the second story. After that, you have to walk around the second floor to figure out how to get to the third, and so on for ten floors!Get on with it!<br />The most annoying thing is definitely the animals. On multiple occasions, I've been attacked by a pack of wolves while skinning the tiger that just attacked me. Of coarse, nearly every animal in the game takes multiple head shots to kill, even when it's five wolves, which is a problem compounded by the fact, even by Ubi-Soft standards, The shooting on this game is just awful. On most Ubi-Soft games, it's typical to aim right at the guy's head and end up hitting his shoulder, this game is even worse. Animals even attack you while you're hiding in the bushes trying to sneak up to a guard post so you can take it sneakily, which is about the only way to do it in this game., The combat is pretty bad too.<br />And while we're on the subject of combat, whose idea was it too make it so the only way to heal is to take 15-20 seconds out of combat(I timed it) So you're guy can wrap a bandage around his arm during which time you can't sprint, reload, or do anything to fight off the dad guys who are trying to kill you? You only recover one block of health when you do it! And they give you six blocks if you earn them, otherwise you start out with two, but the enemy is armed with weapons that can take away three or four block with one hit. Then, as a cruel joke, one of the skills you can earn is faster re-loads. REALLY!? How about faster revives?<br />I liked the Far Cry games on original Xbox, I liked Far Cry 2. But after that, I stopped enjoying these games.ing these games.	2015-08-07

Do you like the Fast and the Furious? Do you not like playing as Batman? Then this game is for you.  The Batmobile is the Poochie of this game.  Every time I try and do anything it's like the game is pulling a &#34;We need more batmobile in everything. Whenever the batmobile isn't on the screen people should be asking? 'Hey, Where's the batmobile?'&#34; Race the batmobile, play World of Tanks with the batmobile, escort this car, transport this person, car chase after this riddler car, figure out some convoluted mechanism to get the batmobile from one roof to another to a ramp to inside a building just to charge up a battery, why fight a group of enemies when you just pull up the batmobile and shoot them all?? Of the 9? boss fights in the game.  Six of them are using the batmobile.<br /><br />That's right. The interesting bosses/rogues in the Batman universe take a backseat in the Batmobile.  Two that don't are incredibly boring and simple and just have you fighting minions.  One is a little more interesting, but marginally.<br /><br />The Arkham Knight mystery isn't a mystery.  Other characters are downplayed, and all female characters are fridged.<br /><br />There's one good element to this game that I don't want to give away for spoilers, but it actually could have just been a DLC.  In fact, that's what this whole game feels like.  A DLC that got stretched out by adding the Batmobile.<br /><br />Should the batmobile be in a Batman game? Absolutely! Should it be in every facet of the game? Your mileage may very.	2015-08-07

These are a no nonsense, no frills way to add grip and height to just about any analog stick controller. Easy to apply and they hold tight. The nubs do not bother my thumbs as others have reported. This may be due to my thumbs resting inside the cup and pressing against the side of the nubs. Larger thumbs would likely rest on top of the nubs and cause discomfort.

There have definitely been some better Forza games out there. I have number 2,3,4,and this is 5, of coarse. The driving physics aren't very good on this one, it's back to driving like you have bald tires on a hockey rink that's covered with marbles. There are assist if you find it too difficult, but then it's way too easy. They're also back to making you get a law degree in order to know what car can be used on what track. They don't even tell you what the qualifications are for using a car on a particular track, so if you spend a whole lot of money making a car the way you thought it needed to be, you may find that you've wasted a whole lot of money. But that's all the downside of this game. The good things about this game are mainly the AI. The opponents you race on this one are &#34;drivatars.&#34; The game compiles records of how you drive and turns that data into a drivatar, which it puts into other people's games so that they are racing opponents that drive like real humans. It's very nice that you are only as likely to wipe out as one of your opponents, because, like most Forza games, you're going to wipe out a lot. All that being said, if this were my first Forza game, I would be impressed. Knowing what I know about it now that I own it, though, I would have waited for Forza six to come out if I had to buy it again.	2015-08-07

Once the game arrived he was completely hooked on it and pretty much wouldn't do anything besides play the game. He seemed okay with it, but it only took him a total of five hours or maybe less to complete the game; so anyone looking into a game that has a longer story line and takes longer to play I wouldn't recommend this game.

I have bought one of these before, and it only lasted for a few months. Not all I get is input lag and it over heats. Afraid it might melt my system. Here's one thing, I would recommend you buying the original brand from its original retailer. These are just cheap brands. The original makers are from Neoya. Don't fall victim to the switch thing. I have and it doesn't have a switch. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it worked while it lasted. So becareful who you buy from and read reviews first and do your homework. I'm not bashing the product. I'd rather buy the one from Neoya because it only upscales to 720p from what their official site said. As I said I bought mine because I was being cheap, well if your are being cheap, you buy a cheap product, don't expect it to last long.	2015-08-07

I'm not at all sure why it's discriminated against as much as it is. I can spell it out nice and simple. They took all the flaws they found in black ops 2 and made a game by fixing those flaws. For example, the number of perks you can use, no tac insert, pistols aren't overly powerful, spawn trapping is reduced, boosting isn't as easily obtained, and it has maps set up for different types of warfare. For example, you have the map stone haven which is a really large map. During you'll notice a village and ruins near the castle. Which are meant for close ranged battles. Then the rest of the map is long ranged. My favorite part about this game would have to be the sniper rifles with chrome barrel!	2015-08-07

Bought it for my brother to use during our 14-hour gaming sessions of Monster Hunter 4U. It's extremely comfortable to use, even over extended periods of play and keeps your hands from cramping up. It's hard to see in the stock photos, but there are actually 6 buttons on the top. The obvious large trigger style Z buttons are very much like PS3 style and are spring loaded so they respond very well and are pretty sensitive. Above it is the small shoulder button for the ZR button so you get a play style very similar to the PS3 controller, again. The big surprise was that I thought the large triangle piece next to both of those buttons was just a hunk of plastic that jutted out but it's actually a second ZR button (I believe it's ZR... I didn't get to validate that for sure) for those who's fingers are too large to sit comfortably on the other buttons. I think this is incredibly smart move and my brother seems to like it a lot.<br />The plastic and construction doesn't feel too cheap. It feels slightly more sturdy than some of the other grips out there and it holds on pretty solid to your 3DSXL. It will not come off without some pretty purposeful prying.<br /><br />Any monhunters out there looking for a more comfortable grip, I highly recommend giving this one a try.	2015-08-07

I had soundproofed the basement so the demonic chanting and wailing of tortured souls was okay, as it couldn't penetrate the stacks of used mattresses I had lined the walls with. Anyway, I saw this online and figured it would help me take care of the problem. DOES NOT WORK. First, you have to plug it into a computer, so I had to drag my Apple IIe into the basement while fighting off increasing numbers of damned souls. Second, it has NO EFFECT on demons like to box claims it will. THIRD, the shell is very shiny, but cheaply made and so attracts fingerprints like nobody's business. It's nitpicking, I know, but you have to have standards. So now my basement is a lost cause. Now I have to board it up and sell the house before the police get wise to all the missing hitchhikers..<br /><br />And I'm still waiting for a refund!	2015-08-07

The Etrian series is being revamped for the 3DS. Not only are we getting new characters, a story mode and a handful of new quests to spice things up, but we also got a heaping of new gameplay mechanics. And where the mechanics are concerned, they really pulled out all the stops. From something simple as pitfall traps for epic, near-invulnerable FOEs to complex recipes (I know, there's something similar in the original EO3, but having to choose the right ingredients makes it more involving and challenging) and developing the city. This mini-SimCity bonus is very subtle and nuanced, and since it's an easy way to earn titanic quantities of money while you wander the ginormous tree, most players will sink several dozen hours into this.  Combat is as streamlined as ever, and the Story Mode characters require creative thinking. Your War Magus can heal your party twice a turn with a since spell, the Princess heals members with every order, and ailments play a significant role, particularly with debuffs. This may be restrictive and frustrating for some players, with good reason. I recommend Classic Mode and Let's Plays on YouTube. Character development receives a more prominent focus, and your partners aren't simply there to take up space.  If your parents complain about video games, just tell them that there is more reading on the main menu than there ever will be on a sporting field.	2015-08-07

There should be an entertainment bundle for the Xbox one that when you buy it brand new, it comes with things like a few new blu Ray DVDs, an extra controller with keypads on both of them, it should come STANDARD with the Xbox one TV/DVD remote just for the fact that you can stream your cable through the ones HDMI, and theirs ALOT of people use this feature, the only issue is you can't control the one guide with the Xbox one controller. You can open it but, you can't select a channel yet, the TV remote works just fine, and the ... Unless I'm missing something and I did something to knock the sync off.

The first 2 games were awesome and this has been a complete dissapointment. It's very hard to get use to the driving controls and every mission I feel is surrounded using the stupid Batmobile/tank. Very repetitive and I'm not shocked that they ruined this franchise, I never post unless I really need to warn others but I can tell you this game is awful. No plot, your left wondering around for hours to figure out what to do or where to go and it gets annoying after a while. I hate that they killed this game, what a shame.<br /><br />Update Aug 31, 2015<br /><br />Ok I was pretty critical in my earlier review and that might have been because the tanks REALLY pissed me off. However, after putting over 20+ hours into it I am only 60% through the game. There IS a plot and actually it just takes time to develop. The graphics on this game are amazing but because there is to much going on the PS4 controller gets laggy sometimes, I don't know if anyone else is having this issue, my controller is new.  I also downloaded some extra content after the fact and seriously this game is addicting even if you hate it at first. I changed my review from a 2 to a 4 star. This turns around from a disappointment to a really sweet game, you just need patience.	2015-08-07

This game was a sleeper and an awesome game....great story, great controls and control responsiveness, excellent fighting moves and upgrades, etc. This is on par with gta IV and gta v on the xbox 360...but it has more responsive controls, better fighting moves ,better shooting and cover system, etc.....The only categories gta beats this in is in the story , more activities to do and more vehicles, and the online that's it but i love sleeping dogs best...if you're on the fence about this game do yourself a favor and get it, you won't be dissappointed at all!

Having never played, he recommended I get Skyrim to learn about the world and how it would semi-feel playing the online game.  I figured, 'well, I am a fan of Fallout 3 and this is from the same company.'  The world is huge and you have quest and it all has the mid evil fiction feel.  I have no problems with the game play or anything.  I got used but I have no issues with how it functions.  I give it 4 stars because I haven't really gotten into the game yet.  I've barely scratched the surface, and based on my experience with Fallout 3, I am not in a position to be sucked into this world yet.  I know it will consume me, so I can't play it and give it my full attention yet.	2015-08-07

It worked great when I got it and, aside from a few cosmetic blemishes, it looked great too. The controller was worn and has some stick drift but that's expected of a used controller. What is unacceptable about this is that less than three months after my purchase the damn thing won't work properly. It started turning on a and off by itself, making the startup noises while off and opening the disc tray randomly. Then the Wireless internet connector stopped working. And for icing on the cake, now it won't go five minutes before it turns off by itself. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase. I have owned several Xbox 360s and this is by far the worst of them. I would not recommend buying a used console of any kind from Amazon.	2015-08-07

Both consoles came with a stock mic for gaming. The difference? The ps4s stock mic actually worked. The Xbox one has a software issue that breaks headsets (it pretty much broke my stock headset right off the bat). After doing some research I found out that it can happen just as easily with any headset you buy for it. Oh wait I know! I'll use a bluetooth...nope cant do that. How about a mic with a 3.5mm audio jack? Hmm cant do that either. So, Microsoft, you're telling me I have to buy the kinect to talk to people in game? I dont have that problem on ps4 (not trying to fuel the console war, I'm just really pissed off at microsoft for this panzy ass paper weight they call a gaming console). So with the mic issue out of the way lets get to another. The controller feels a lot cheaper than it looks. And with the mic adapter plugged in its really bulky and uncomfortable. The 360 controllers were worth their weight in gold. WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING MICROSOFT? Now for the interface of the console. The whole thing just seems awkward. Yeah its grouped into &#34;catagories&#34;, but at first everything is really hard to find. I had to look up online how to get into the settings so I could update my mic and controller (only to have the mic stop working 10 minutes later because of the software issue). Oh and one last thing. The xbox ones wireless wifi capability just took a crap and now only a wired connection will allow it to connect to live. So yeah. Thats why I'm pissed at microsoft. Sorry but if you want a next gen console I cant recommend the xbox one, go with the ps4 instead. Theres nothing &#34;next gen&#34; about this paper weight.	2015-08-07

May have a one in a million case here but this item literally broke my original SNES video source signal. I played the original NES version of Contra for about 10 minutes shut it off and put in Contra III for SNES and discovered that my console no longer played the SNES games it was meant to play. Out of the 50 I have none of them worked nor did any flash cart device. Original NES games work while using the adapter and A / V cable but the original SNES games no longer work at all. Use with caution with your old original consoles. I would have to recommend using just a retro console of some sort to play old NES games on after this fiasco. Can't really recommend this product or vise versa either because its does actually work but very very poorly on newer TVs.	2015-08-07

The noise is there, however, not noticeable.<br /><br />In detail, I bought this unit with the desire to block dust from raining on my giant block. And, although there's plenty of spacing in my media setup, having more ways to allow heat to escape is never a bad thing. So, this unit serves that purpose very well. I've gone through almost a week of &#34;heavy use&#34; with continuous usage, game/moves...win 10 streaming?. Anyway, it's great and can feel the heat being released with some force. The  noise is also not too bad.<br /><br />The noises: Folks complained but let's put some things into context: 1) how does this compare to a power rig with 9x fan? It's like a mouse vs an elephant, this unit being the former 2) I have a sound bar, nothing fancy with insane sub/bass output nor am I deaf with the volume to max. Standing up close, or 10-15 feet away I cannot hear the fan noise from this unit 3) ambient noise from my apartment, ie. normal talking,cooking,neighbors...again cannot hear this unit's fan. So, it's very quiet in this perspective. I will admit, however, you're gonna hear something if my home theater setup was meant to be church quiet. But seriously? if you want that level of quiet, YOU WILL HEAR THE XBOX's STOCK FAN REGARDLESS.	2015-08-07

It's just kinda average. The third-person camera constantly resets itself, the controls feel like you're wading in ankle deep water but you can rotate at the speed of light, and the combat really wants to be Arkham Asylum but it's not as good. Often times, when the dodge indicator appears, the attack is over before you have time to dodge it. In some cases, an enemy might be against a wall and you won't even see the dodge indicator.<br />The graphics are also surprisingly bad, and the animations are downright laughable. You can tell that some of the animations were made late at night in the office and whatever poor soul was animating JJJ's eyelids just didn't care enough to make it look good.<br />I hear the keyboard controls are good, but I've used the Xbox 360 controller so far, which has support without fiddling with any settings. That's great.<br />However, I'm underwhelmed. This is like a worse Spider-Man 2 (PS2), and that game honestly isn't that good to begin with. Maybe if Spider-Man 3 had a bit of a smaller scope, it would be better. As it is, though, it's just kind of mediocre. Play it if you love the character or if you like the movie. If you just want to play a fun Spider-Man game, try out Ultimate Spider-Man or Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions.	2015-08-07

[[ASIN:B00UVN21IU Thrustmaster VG T3PA-PRO 3-Pedal Add-On Set]]<br />This is a high-quality, durable pedal set made to work within the Thrustmaster Eco System of Racing Wheel products.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Packaging - Very well packaged.  Everything was neat, organized and secure.  Robust packaging might be an understatement.<br />Build Quality - High quality, substantial pedals.  All metal chassis and pedals make these feel very well put together.  They are heavy enough to where they do not have to be fastened down to be used.  I have mine on carpet and leaning against a wall; they do not move.<br />Flexibility and Options - The setup possibilities are near limitless.  From the F1/GT Style to the individual position of each individual pedal to the options available for the Brake Mods; the options available might actually seem to be too many for some.  And that is a good thing.<br />Price - For the money, these are the best out there.  The only real comp out there is the Fanatec Elite ($149.95 plus shipping), but that set does not offer near the setup options of these and with shipping, costs more.  These are an upgrade for those accustomed to G27 Pedals (even modded ones) or any 2-pedal set on the market.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Clutch Feel - Due to the F1/GT position options, the Clutch and Accelerator pedals are functionally identical.  The feel is the same for both.  Ideally the Clutch would have a different feel to it compared to the Accelerator.  But this is a relatively small nitpick within the grand scheme of the other benefits.<br />Compatibility - These can ONLY be used with a Thrustmaster Wheel base (Thrustmaster T300rs, Thrustmaster T500 for the PS3/PS4/PC and the Thrustmaster TX for the XBox One/PC).  They cannot be used as a stand-alone item.  This is the Achilles Heel of an otherwise 5 Star item.  No stand-alone option hurts the broader appeal of an otherwise stellar product.<br /><br />Overall, great pedals.  Almost perfect.  If you're wheelis a Thrustmaster, this is a no-brainer purchase.	2015-08-07

When the New 3DS XL (N3DSXL) came out, I was skeptical of whether or not it was really worth buying considering I already had an original 3DS. I loved the original 3DS but always felt that the 3D itself on the system wasn't very good, considering you had to hold in it in an exact position to see the 3D. The face tracking on the N3DSXL totally fixes this problem, and the 3D is also much easier on the eyes! I love it! Its faster processor also allows you to download eshop titles quicker and load games faster! This is truly an upgrade on an already great console that has lived up to the expectations I had for it!<br /><br />I was also very much hoping that it could play original DS games in as good quality as the old 3DS. Well it turns out this system can play them so clearly that it rivals even the DSI XL, making it noticeably better than the old 3DS in yet another way!<br /><br />The C-stick is something I was also skeptical of it at first, as I really liked playing with the Circle Pad Pro (CPP) (though I didn't like how cumbersome it was to carry around). But though it's just a nub, it actually has very good accuracy and is another great addition to the console, making it like a much more handy version of the CPP (the ZR and ZL buttons are included too). It is detected as by games which supported the CPP but were made before the N3DSXL giving the console complete backwards compatibility.<br /><br />Given the fact that it can play original DS titles, 3DS titles and New 3DS exclusives (though there are only two at the time of this review), it has one of the best libraries of games to chose from of any console out there. I highly recommend the 3 Castlevania titles for the DS and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate for the 3DS. Also, don't forget Resident Evil: Revelations!<br /><br />Given the fact that I am primarily (though not exclusively) a handheld gamer, I think I would say that the N3DSXL is my very favorite console ever released.	2015-08-07

This review would've been 4 star, however, based on what the bundle's intended use, it lost a star. Here's why:<br /><br />The stand for the controller is nice and even &#34;elegant&#34;. That's what I was really looking for in my &#34;feng sui&#34;-ness living room. The cost itself is pretty comparable. So for all intended purposes that was great. Getting on with the whole package itself, however, which comes with the two battery units; they...suck. Literally the battery will lose its battery life by 25% overnight if it wasn't continuously charged. Further, it's completely dead after 2 hours or less of use. The battery life does not hold vs the official MS battery you can find for $25 a piece on Amazon...which I also have. So, I snapped back my old battery and all is well.<br /><br />Do not buy this because you think it's a nice investment, it's quite weak.	2015-08-07

About five or six years ago Namco Bandai released this little gem of a game.  In the intervening years, people seem to refer to this game as a &#34;hidden gem,&#34; &#34;overlooked,&#34; etc.  All those descriptors are true.  It really is one of the most under appreciated games in recent memory.<br /><br />I loved this game for many reasons, but above all, I loved it for the relationship between Monkey and Trip.  Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw are simply superb in this game.  In fact, Lindsey Shaw was so good that I'm really, really surprised she hasn't done more voice work since.  Maybe she's been approached and decided not to.  I dunno.  Whatever the case may be, I really wish she'd lend her talents more often.  She's great.<br /><br />Andy Serkis, of course, is no slouch.  With a resume that includes Lord of the Rings and the upcoming Star Wars, his bona fides are beyond question and he's amazing in his role of Monkey.  For a big brute of a thing, Monkey is grounded in reality and very, very human.  This, of course, is thanks to Mr. Serkis.<br /><br />I won't go into plot or gameplay, though I believe both are superb, because to do so would potentially rob you of the experience.  I will say, however, that its one of those games that stays with you long after you complete it.

The premise of Far Cry 4 is a little foreign to me but forms a good basis for the game.

I'm not hanging on the cutting edge of technology...I usually wait for awhile until stuff goes on sale for my nearly-defunct consoles, and it might take even longer for me to actually get around to really playing the game. I have been meaning to pick up Solatorobo: Red The Hunter for several years now and I ordered it once but there was a shipping error, I got refunded, then I forgot about trying to get it and it sat on my wishlist for some time. A month ago I was &#34;cleaning up&#34; my wishlist so I tossed it back into the cart. The only reason I bought it was because I liked the artwork on the cover and I read a few reviews saying it was one of those really good games that not enough people become aware of.<br /><br />The other day the power went out and I plopped down on the bed with my Nintendo DS and Solatorobo. I was very fond of the PS One game &#34;Tail Concerto&#34; back in the day, and I had no idea this game was related to it. As soon as I began playing, though, it brought back the familiar thrill of Tail Concerto and I was instantly immersed in the gameplay. Solatorobo has excellent controls and amazing graphics. Whenever a console is near the end of its run, a few games will always come out that really push the limits of what it can do. Those games are *always* amazing and never get the attention they deserve because people are usually focusing on the next console coming out and what it can do. All the while not realizing that the old console they have turned away from still had great potential that only seems to be unlocked after years of game development.<br /><br />This game looks and plays better than many sloppy, clunky games on the 3DS. The story is involving, the characters have depth and are cute and fun. I think that may be what turns some gameplayers away, they see &#34;cute&#34; and instantly think it's for girls or very young children, but that is not the case.The canine & feline anthropomorphic characters look like they're straight out of an anime series. Add into the mix cool mechas to ride around in, a somewhat steampunk-inspired world of floating islands over a plasma sea, and you are beginning to get an idea what the game is like. The graphics are, interestingly, a combination of 2D and 3D sprites mixed together with animated cut scenes. It reminded me also a little of Klonoa. The backgrounds are lush and impressive.<br /><br />The gameplay involves a lot of hopping around in the mech and picking things up and throwing them. There elements of not only fighting and platformer games but RPG as well. The only thing that has been somewhat annoying is that the game, while very fun and sometimes challenging, is not terribly difficult. I kept feeling like I was in introduction mode even when I wasn't. You will get the hang of things very quickly and it's annoying that the game keeps stopping gameplay to give you tips, help you don't need and generally hold your hand when you don't want it. It doesn't entirely ruin things and it's still a great game but I wish the difficulty level was higher. But there are lots of quests to unlock and different mechs open up different map areas. I would definitely recommend the game to all ages, either gender.	2015-08-07

The events include dressage, cross country and arena jumping. The training and events were enjoyable but only in small doses- otherwise I found it to be very repetitious. I didn't like the horse care at all. You have to do it, such as grooming, feeding, petting, etc. otherwise your horse won't perform as well. But it's dull and you're required to do it way too often. It's a nice little game for horse lovers though but the price is steep for this type of game.	2015-08-07

I would give this type pad a 4 or 5 easily if only it worked as consistently as it doesn't work. Way waay waaay too often does this darn thing just &#34;disconnect&#34; from my ps4 (the only thing I have it synced to btw) try plugging it in nothing, try going to the ps4 device settings to connect it there aaaaaand you guesses it NOTHING!! I don't have time to resynch it every time it does this. I play Final Fantasy 14 online and players of the game as well as any mmorpg players know that not being able to properly communicate with your raid is a no no. I want a full refund because I already have a keyboard that's wireless and has backlit keys and it also doesn't randomly unsych it's self from my ps4, only reason I bought this is because I like the convince of not having to put my controller down to chat but that's not as bad as having to exit my game to make this thing work. Smh lucky I'm giving it 2 stars cuz I did like it when it actually worked. Hope other users have a better time than me with this product as for me I think I'm done with Nyko	2015-08-07

There's also a little tag on it's right side behind its shoes with it's name/logo on it.<br /><br />The only real nitpicking I could say about the yarn yoshis is the fact that the yarn can get frizzy if you're not careful, but it's not bad.

Before I went to the the dark side, I loved my playstation and one day I was mentioning to my boyfriend how i miss playing on my playstation because I loved all the old games. Since I no longer had my playstation, my boyfriend surprised me with one. I didn't want a ps3, I had no interest in playing any playstation exclusives. I just missed the controls and the system. Anyway, I  grew up playing Tekken and I decided to pick this up. I am probably the worst person at fighting games, at least in versus, and I love this game. I pretty much just played story mode and I had so much fun doing it. When I picked this game up again I was thrilled to be playing Tekken.

I had this game for PC growing up and didn't know it was made for Xbox so I had to buy it when I saw it. Boy was I not disappointed.

There are only few things holding this game back from being one of the best shooters on xbox 360. Lack of co-op and local multiplayer are my issues with the game. However there are so many positives. For an old game, this game is packed, there is so much to do, so many weapons, gadgets, drones and vehicles to use along with big maps to choose which routes you take and how you fight. It felt very much to me like a FPS version of Ghost Recon to be honest, which is a good thing. It's challenging as well, I ran through it on Hardcore, and it was indeed very hardcore. Everything is fun about this game, gameplay, level design, music, graphics, etc. This game packs a punch for it to be an older title, and the price range is also nice. Overall this is a very solid FPS, highly recommended as a Single player and online experience.	2015-08-07

I may be doing that. I picked this up a week ago. Last time I took a chance on a game I ended up loving it and did the same thing with this, I thought I was going to get something similar to Dynasty Warriors.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. If I have to describe this in one word it would be &#34;bland&#34;.<br />-Uninteresting Story<br />-Little to no animations<br />-Small Maps<br />-Grinding, lots and lots of grinding<br />-Boring characters<br /><br />The whole game just seems sub-par on my 4 hour venture of forcing myself to find something to like. A game has to be realllly bad for me to just stop caring. This one is up there. Save your money. Oh yeah, and if you've ever seen those videos of Japanese dudes aggressively rubbing virtual boobies on their vita screen. This game has one of those mini-games. In the option menu you can configure panties they were. It's cringe worthy and not something I wanted to plat at all.<br /><br />In closing, this game is for someone, and there's 3 of them. So it does have followers. Just wasn't my cup-o-tea. I'd move onto something else if you're just looking for something new to play and don't know much about the game.	2015-08-07

Almost all of the characters are unlikable, and some of them are so poorly written they flat-out speak gibberish.<br /><br />All that aside, however, the game is epic on a massive scale. The fights with giant dragons almost makes this a must-own alone.

US	24846840	R2FYV4KYAPI517	B00FJWNSU8	444609049	Injustice: Gods Among Us	Video Games	5	2	3	N	N	Ultimately great!	After NetherRealm has proven themselves beyond worthy by giving the world [[ASIN:B002I0J998 one of the best Mortal Kombat games to date]], they had decided to give a similar treatment to DC superheroes (Although this isn't the first time these characters appeared in [[ASIN:B0017ZDGWG Mortal Kombat]][[ASIN:B00002ST6R -like]] games). And like Mortal Kombat, months after the game became a hit among fighting game fans, the studio released a beefed up version that includes the downloadable content featured in the game. I don't believe the developers really added or improved too much of whatever else within Injustice for its Playstation 4 debut, as the graphics noticeably seem more in line with what previous-generation consoles offered, but that doesn't quite matter since this game is awesome.<br /><br />Granted, the plot had me kind of confused regarding what was going on. Apparently, the Joker has destroyed Metroplis, killing millions of people, using a nuclear weapon, and has also tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane. Superman in turn decides to murder Joker and then establishes a world government, acting as an egotistic dictator. Yep; Superman is the villain. And there's more puzzling storytelling when a whole other dimension gets tossed in with the primary DC heroes cast, and chaos ensues through superhero fights with each other. The plot isn't perfect, but it's still cool that Injustice's story mode is like a superhero movie with playable fight sequences.<br /><br />PLAYING the game is where things get fun (since this is, y'know, a game)! Considering the development team that made this title, Injustice plays almost exactly like their efforts on Mortal Kombat, except with DC superheroes. If you've played an arcade-like fighting game before, you know how the basics work; there are many kinds of attacks your hero can do, of course, and as you're fighting your opponent, you can use attacks that range from mere punches and kicks to complex strategies that can involve combinations of superpowers and fisticuffs. There are also the Special Moves which can allow for your character to pull off insanely over-the-top (Literally; Batman runs the opponent over with his Batmobile for example) ways to deplete the enemy's health. The action is easy to pick-up-and-play, and through button pressings one can figure out how to learn new moves and use them more wisely. I absolutely adore that in fighting games like this, because there are games out there where I'd be limited as to what moves I'd know at all, and I wouldn't be able to figure them out. Here, Injustice is flexible enough to provide ways to do so.<br /><br />At some point(s) during the battles, the two characters onscreen will clash with each other in a Rock-Paper-Scissors kind of fashion. While it's cool to watch them go and duke it out, the actual gameplay mechanic doesn't feel like it should be utilized in this style, as it's basically a game of chance to see if your enemy's health bar slightly increases or decreases. It doesn't matter too much to me though, because what I find way more interesting is how the arenas are constructed; not only do the fighting stages look as gorgeous as they are, but they can also be interacted with! There are various objects that may seem like decoration, but you could actually toss them or do whatever else they're supposed to do, including but not limited to teleporters and windows you can break. This alone adds to the fighting nicely, and helps give the stages identity.<br /><br />Really, as questionable as certain little things could be, they don't take away at all from the fact that Injustice is a super-fun action-packed fighter! It might be a strand or two away from being as amazing as Mortal Kombat, but I would be lying if I said there was a time where I didn't enjoy playing this game. I wholeheartedly recommend playing this if you're a fan of fighting games and especially Mortal Kombat. If you're a fan of DC Comics, that may as well be a bonus to your satisfaction.	2015-08-07

At first the controller didn't seem to want to go in, but a little jiggling and extra careful effort worked it in place. We only have two controllers and we store them on this thing to keep them fully charged and ready at all times. They get used daily. Much better than leaving our PS3 on to charge the controllers, especially since it (PS3) gets so hot! Affordable and worth every penny!	2015-08-07

Although the Batman statue seems a little cheap since it contains removable parts, including the entire Batman figure itself. The art book is really great, so is the DLC content, that id what I have to say about the physical stuff. If you are wondering about the game I had a great time. Story is fantastic although some characters are totally wasted, could have been better, find out yourself what I mean. Overall the game is filled with surprises and many bad guys to fight.	2015-08-07

The wireless tech in these works great, but the mechanism that controls the D-pad movement is fundamentally flawed causing left and right movement actions to register up and down movement as well. Any game that detects the simultaneous keypress as &#34;diagonal movement&#34; becomes completely unplayable. They also are made with a very thin plastic that isn't evenly textured or colored.<br /><br />I got these with the hopes of having a wireless retro gaming experience, but they are unusable.	2015-08-07

This is an excellent product. The center post design works excellent and is definitely a necessity for a force feedback wheel. I have been using mine now for 6 months and couldn't be happier. I didn't have the room for an entire cockpit setup in my small apartment and this was by far the best solution available. When not in use I can just slide this into the corner and have my living room back. The customer service was great, he worked with me every step to make sure I got what I needed for the best gaming experience possible.<br /><br />I actually needed to switch out the Big Boy bar for the normal size because my chair was exactly the size of the cushion of my lazy-boy, but I had my new part in days.
