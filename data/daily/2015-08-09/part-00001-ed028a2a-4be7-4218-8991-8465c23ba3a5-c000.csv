I wear them all the time in the summer, especially to the lake, so I submerge them in both lake and saltwater many times over the summer. I have arch support issues (I buy $60 inserts for my regular shoes) and I don't feel pain related to that when I wear these shoes, so they seem to have some arch support built into the sole. Am ordering a second pair to replace my old ones that are wearing out. I've been really happy with these.	2015-08-09

I was looking for comfortable sandals that I could walk in for miles with no discomfort, and tried these on at be store. They felt great and looked nice, so I got them. However, one of the plastic pieces on the front of my right shoe snapped into pieces the first (and only!!!) time I wore these shoes out. This was very unfortunate, because the plastic pieces are what holds all of the straps together.  I was left hobbling around in public with my foot dangling out of the front of my sandal while I tried to find something to wear for the rest of the day.  Other people who had purchased this same shoe had similar experiences (look up its reviews on DSW's website). This was probably one of the worst purchases I've ever made.	2015-08-09

I discovered the existence of Vionics at a tourist shop while on vacation and purchased the Vionic Tide Sequins in gold. I worried I wouldn't get used to the feel of the arch support, but having spoken with several other women in the store who loved their Vionics & came back to buy more, I decided to give it a try. Within 2 or 3 days, I was completely used to wearing them. I love the gold with light color clothes, but I wanted a different darker color and found the bronze on Amazon. These &#34;Tide Sequins&#34; sandals happen to fit my feet perfectly, where as I found (while trying different types of Vionic sandals on vacay) that some were slightly too wide for my somewhat narrow feet. I'm very happy with the bronze color Tide Sequins Vionics as they look great with dark colored jeans, jean-type capris or darker summer clothes. I also like that there's a little bit of extra toe room as well. And so far they've held up great to getting wet, unintentionally via garden hose or rain water puddles. ;) I should add that I usually wear size 8-1/2 or size 9 in some shoes and sandles, but these in size 8 fit just fine.	2015-08-09

I am firmly a size 8.5 medium width - I've never worn a wide width shoe in my life. These shoes, however... Well, they were just a bit odd-fitting. The edges of the foot bed are raised so that your foot will be kind of cradled in the shoe. It fit fine everywhere, except the inside edge of my arch. I really, really wanted these to work, so I tried them indoors on 3 separate occasions, hoping I misremembered the fit. Unfortunately I discovered that in addition to the weird foot bed issue, the strap that sits under your ankle bone was also a little too high up for my foot and was rubbing uncomfortably. So sadly, these had to go back.<br /><br />I still love Clarks though! It does seem like lately it's getting harder to find a proper fit.	2015-08-09

I got the teal color and would buy the other 2 if they become available in my size (SIZE 8. OH PLEASE!) 100% happy with these.

Over the years I've had issues with minor back pain that could make work uncomfortable. I tried the orange superfeet and most of my back pain is now gone. I was surprised that the rigid insoles would be comfortable during long days on my feet, but my feet thank me for the arch support and padding. My most recent pair lasted two years before they needed replacing, so despite the expense of these insoles, pretty good!	2015-08-09

These are great shoes.They will last for a long time Already wore a pair for about 2 years in food service.

Made really well and are the best shoes that I have found yet for slip resistant protection with safety toe. You can't go wrong with these ones so I highly recommend this product.

Both have arrived with creases in the leather, scuffs on the soles and not packaged properly. The strap has increased wear due to packaging as well.

I wanted them for work but the perforations gave them a casual look.	2015-08-09

It is sturdy but cute, and has so much room for things. If you want a canvas bag that's feminine this is perfect. It is a tad bit larger than I'd expected, so make sure to measure.

They're comfortable enough for shopping or eating stops as well, but not so comfortable that I would want to wear them all day. If going somewhere and I expect to walk a lot or be out for many hours, I will take tennis shoes and change once there.<br /><br />These fit true to size, I wear 11, ordered 11, they fit comfortably. The zipper is a little finicky to zip up, but it zips down very easily. There is some material that interferes a little at the bottom, so even when pulling out on the zipper a little, it still takes a little tugging to get past that spot. I wanted the zipper access for quick and easy on/off, which I mostly get, but I worry my investment will be for naught if one of the zippers goes out.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with this purchase. The bike was too hard on the tennis shoes, I needed something that would hold up when riding, these will  do nicely. I'll post an update if have any problems with the zipper (or anything else). :)	2015-08-09

Mostly just impressed by how great they look, the color is a little darker than in the picture but that's not a big deal. Also they don't use any leather, so if you're looking for cruelty free dress shoes try these.  Edit: It's been 5 months and these shoes are still great.  No scuff marks or really any wear and tear. Going to ask for a black pair for Christmas, but maybe the Cabot Oxford version just to mix it up.	2015-08-09

These were cute and I love the feel on the pleather, but I have never put on a such a large 7.5. Note if you buy these, get them in a size or two smaller than your regular size foot. I usually fit perfectly in a 7.5 and this totally felt like an 8.5, plus my skinny legs barely fit inside this boot. I left some photos so you can see how large these boots are on my legs. I also measured my leg at the top where the boot hit. It measured 12 inches and the boot was 16 inches. So now you know if you buy a 7.5 and you have a 16 inch around upper calf, then these should fit there nicely. I really wish  clothes went by real measurements and not silly numbers.	2015-08-09

I have several other pairs of Ariat cowboy boots and they are generally true to size. These were the right size in width, but the top part of the boot where it's supposed to be snug across the instep barely touched my foot, and I have a very high instep. Normally I have to fight to get my foot into a boot because of my instep, even if they fit well once my feet are inside. But these didn't even have a &#34;thud&#34; sound when I put my foot in, like cowboy boots are supposed to - my foot just slid right in and out. If I kept them and let the leather break in a bit my foot would probably come straight out of them. I couldn't even go down a size because I'm a 5.5 and a 5 doesn't exist in this style. This is an issue that must be specific to the shape of this particular boot because it seemed to be the right size length- and width-wise and I've never had this happen with Ariats before. Very weird.<br /><br />On top of that, the color wasn't what I expected. It's certainly pretty, but the first thing I noticed when I took them out of the box was that they were not as blue as I hoped (I purchased them in Waterfall) - I realize images on monitors can look different from real life, but every image I've seen of these boots on various websites was very clearly blue. When I pulled them out of the box, they immediately struck me as being much greener than expected. They are still blue, but they're a kind of teal that looks green when you hold it against something blue and blue when you hold it against something green. I really was hoping for true blue boots. Don't get me wrong, it's still a gorgeous color and very unique, just not quite what I was looking for. If the color had been the only issue, I probably would keep them. But the fact that they didn't fit well either means they're going back, despite the awesome sale price.	2015-08-09

I've been wearing Wave Riders for the past several years and have always been happy with them- everytime it was time to replace my shoes, I always bought Wave Riders. The 18s fit differently than earlier versions and are a little uncomfortable. The 18s are more narrow throughout the entire length of the shoe so they are tight, but it seems the length stayed the same. I also was annoyed that the laces on the 18s are so much shorter than past versions.  Since the shoes fit tighter, I kept my laces fairly loose and the laces were so short I couldn't tie them in a normal bow, I had to knot them. I began to experience some hip pain since beginning to wear the 18s- now I don't know if these shoes are really the cause of the pain, but I had not changed anything else about my running so I went back to wearing my old 17s to see if it would make a difference. I've had less pain with my old shoes so I just ordered a new pair of 17s to start wearing again.  Pretty disappointed I wasted $100 on the 18s when I've been completely happy with all the earlier versions of the Wave Riders.	2015-08-09

They look nice enough to wear with a dress.  They stay on a lot better than flip-flops.  There is just enough arch support and cushioning to keep my big wide feet comfortable all day.

Did a lot of walking while I was there, and these served me well. They're nice and cushy, don't flap around as much as other flip-flops, and the band is nice and makes it look a little more dressy. After two months of walking at least two miles every day, one shoe broke - there's a weak spot where the adjustable bits of the band connect - but I was able to fix it pretty easily and continue wearing the shoes for a long time.<br />After several months of heavy walking, I finally wore the bottoms out of that pair, and bought this pair - in black - off Amazon. Same cushy soles and fancier-than-your-average-flip-flop looks, I find them at least as comfortable for walking as my sneakers. My only hope is that this pair doesn't suffer the same weak spot as the last pair - while easily fixable, it's still a bit of a flaw, and is why I don't give these shoes 5 stars.	2015-08-09

I am normally an 8.5M-W, but if there's no W available, a 9M will usually fit.  Listening to the other reviewers, I managed to pick the perfect shoe size for me in this clog, which was a 9.5.  I usually wear these when I'm wearing scrubs. I bought the rusted iron color and get tons of compliments, not to mention that with the correct sizing, it is amazingly comfortable.  The only thing is, on uneven ground or if I'm in a hurry, I sometimes roll my ankle.  But I am prone to this in wedge type heels, so it may not be just this shoe.	2015-08-09

For me they last twice as long as any other work boot that I have tried. I prefer these as they reduce my lower back pain as well. Unfortunately, this work boot comes with D30 drop protection in the toe. This has made the break-in period unbearable. I have had to relace the boot to stop the pressure on the top of my foot. Personally I think they have wrecked the best work boot that was on the market.	2015-08-09

I had the original Ray ban and the colours were not as natural as they are with these pair of lenses. Unfortunately I managed to have a little scratch in one after one week. I can't tell how it happend but it is my fault I guess. ;-)  PS: It's the 23rd of August 2015. I went to the forrest and accidently dropped my sunglasses. It fell on the soft ground and of course there are a lot of scratches on it. As I know from my original RayBan lenses it did not happen at all and I had them replaced two weeks ago after 5 years. This seems to be a lack of production processes to harden the lenses. I am very dissapointed. So I drop my previous rating from 5 stars to 2. I've realized that the little sratch I've reported may be not my fault too	2015-08-09

I bought a pair of Nike sneakers that had the most awful insoles - I almost gave up on those shoes because the insoles made them so uncomfortable. These insoles made a huge difference. I can't say they are perfect but far better. As another reader had said these don't have a lot of arch support (for which I was glad), the toe box area is super comfortable but the heel cushioning is taking a little getting used to - not bad just different. They are also far thicker than the lousy ones I removed so I had to offset but loosening up the laces. So far I think they are well worth the $$.	2015-08-09

I went with this sandal since the heel and platform height measurements are the same as Dansko's “Sophie&#34; but with a different style to the leather uppers.<br /><br />However, I did not pay close attention to the material of the footbed. The “Sophie” description states it’s a DRI-LEX wrapped footbed where as the “Jessie” has a leather-lined footbed.  So what's the issue - DRI-LEX absorbs any foot perspiration while the leather causes an annoying “sucking” sound during every step taken. This “audio issue” may not bother everyone but if you currently own a pair of Dansko “Sophie” sandals you’ll quickly notice the difference.  More than likely I’m going to return these shoes.<br /><br />On a side note, I do like the feel of a leather-wrapped footbed but for shoes that have some type of back heel support, i.e. an adjustable slingback strap.  That would suppress the heel from popping off the shoe, subsequently preventing that “sucking” sound.	2015-08-09

This is my 2nd pair of Timberland Men's Classic 2-Eye Boat Shoe with the gum sole. I bought my 1st pair 4-yrs ago & expect this pair to last just as long. I use mink oil to condition & water proof all of my Timberland boat shoes. It treats the leather giving it some moisture which adds to the length of the shoe wear life. I also have 2-pr of these with white soles that I wear all summer sockless. Those pairs are also treated bi-weekly with mink oil due to the level of water exposure as we are watersport enthusiasts & boat/fish regularly. The gum sole Timberland Men's Classic 2-Eye Boat Shoe I wear with khaki's for casual use only, as my white sole Timberland Men's Classic 2-Eye Boat Shoe are really a boat shoe & the gum rubber sole Timberlands above are more or less a non-water sport boat shoe style vs being actual boat shoe's.	2015-08-09

The color and material is exactly as described and pictured. The boots look nice, not clunky or &#34;military&#34;. As several reviews mention  the zipper for the pocket is difficult to slide, however the zipper for the actual boot slides easily.  The buckles only have a single hole so they are not in fact adjustable.  I usually wear a 8.5 US women's shoe size. I bought these in a 9 and they fit perfectly. They are on the narrow side and I have wide feet so the 9 is just right. They are comfortable and look good. The soles are rubber and not plastic so they have grip to them. I will probably get some in-soles to add because they have no cushioning, which is why I gave them 4 stars.  They are completely lined so no worries about sticky, sweaty, calves.  For the price these are amazing. I will have to see how they stand up to me riding my motorcycle with them.	2015-08-09

My last time wearing them was canoeing 10 miles down a river.  They look casual and are sufficiently protective as street shoes, then easily transition to full immersion for boating and water activities (rafting on the Chattooga... Yeah!!).<br /><br />After reading other reviews that mentioned that these run smaller, I ordered a half size up.  These are still a bit short for me, though I really can't figure out why, unless the absence of a heel strap allows the foot to slip back, giving the perception that the shoe is too short?  And another problem...I have very flat feet.  I mean really flat.  I thought the pull cord would allow me to cinch these tighter so they would fit even me.  However, when pulled tight enough to feel snug, the straps on the sides sort of ballooned outward.  Then when walking in them, the elastic wasn't strong enough to hold them onto my feet so I got the characteristic slapping sound as if I was wearing flip flops.<br /><br />While I love my original Keen Whispers, they didn't transition well to a slide for me.  If they were much less expensive, I would just exchange sizes and keep them, but at this price, I need to like them much more than I did so these will be returned.  Take a look at the pics attached.  The gray/taupe/lavender sandals are at least 3 years old and have visited several rivers and lakes in their lifetime.  They are holding up very well.  The gray whispers that seem to fit well are size 8, the black slides that feel too short are an 8.5.  Go figure!<br /><br />If you found the information in this review to be helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34;.  Thanks!!	2015-08-09

I found the toe box on these to be smaller (not as wide) than my other Keens and they are less comfortable, too, I can only manage a half day in them before I need to switch to another pair (I'm on my feet a lot).  Would return them if I could for a more comfortable style and a better fit.  I'd rate them between a 2 and a 3 for me.	2015-08-09

My podiatrist recommended these because of my chronic metatarsal pain. Both pairs have excellent cushioning in the metatarsal area, so I'm able to be on my feet longer, at a reasonable comfort level, than with other shoes I've tried. I have a low arch, and these fit that area more comfortably than other brands I've tried. I'd definitely buy them again and especially recommend them to anyone with metatarsal pain.	2015-08-09

The width is always right on. These boots are no different. The 7 1/2 is almost a full size too large. The boots look very nice, are comfortable and the quality seems to be top notch.

Any direct sun or water will cause this to happen. I personally had a woman's pair or Riders sandals for pver a year, half the price,with no issues. The price is too expensive for this to be happening.	2015-08-09

Fits a little big but I didn't want to be bothered with a return and only scuff my toes every once in a while. Really nice support... I like the feeling of running barefoot and previously bought NB Minimus regularly. These Mizuno's blow NB away with support and comfort. I was able to put hundreds of miles on NB before they broke down and can't speak to that yet with these shoes but they are showing no signs of wear and tear after 150+ miles. Really like them and being a creature of habit, will probably stick with the brand the next time I'm searching for running shoes.	2015-08-09

You can run with them and use them for everything else in the gym or for casual wear. The LunarGlide 7 is even better! The toebox has slightly more room than the 6 (slightly cramped). The sole feels a little bit softer than the 6 (the 6 can feel a bit stiff sometimes for walking and standing around) while still maintaining very good support. The combination of Flyknit and mesh upper is very good in my opinion, it locks down the foot while looking great. This may probably be the best all around gym shoe for me!	2015-08-09

I don't know how it happens that theses sandals get high marks with other customers, but in my experience, they are truly awful.

Unfortunately I threw away the box, so I didn't bother returning them. Usually stride rite shoes are of decent quality and I never bother to keep the box. I'll know better next time.	2015-08-09

I bought them in narrow.  I have a narrow heel, but need a bit of width at the front of the foot.  These shoes fit well in the heel, but despite being &#34;narrow&#34; they are a little wider than I need at the front.  The &#34;T-strap&#34; styling keeps my foot from sliding forward, though.  They are comfortable, and secure on my feet.  I even wear them dancing!  What I love about Cobb Hill shoes is that they distribute my weight evenly.  I don't feel that I am pitched forward all the time, putting weight on the front of my foot and sliding forward in the shoe.  This makes a great deal of difference when it comes to comfort.  I now own two pairs of the &#34;Aubrey,&#34;  and several other Cobb Hill pumps.	2015-08-09

I really like this shoe, but had to purchase in half-size up (I typically wear 8.5).  The 8.5 started to feel very tight after just an hour of wear, and the fabric cut across the toes.  After a couple of short wears, they are tolerable, but not comfortable.  I didn't feel I could return due to having worn them outside.  I really like the versatility of this fabric peep-toe wedge, however, so I ordered the shoe in size 9.  What a difference!  I was worried the size 9 might slip in the heel, but they fit great; I don't &#34;walk out of them&#34;.  Very comfortable.  Very versatile.  Very professional with summer work dresses, but could also go casual with pants/jeans.  I then bought the same shoe in the navy blue (size 9!).  Love them!	2015-08-09

I use them for the first race yesterday. While everybody was complaining about their shoes being heavy after being in mud and water, mine were not. I had much better traction than anyone I was with and it paid off. They are comfortable to run in and excellent for this type of obstacle course race. The other thing I like about them is that the mud rolls right off of them. They were completely covered in mud and it just rolled right off. It washed right off so easily.

I wore it for about 3 hours. I probably could've worn it for longer, but I had a wardrobe change. Made my next pair of heels feel amazing though =P Again, these are gorgeous! I do recommend it.	2015-08-09

These fit well and are comfortable.  Compared to another set I bought, these have flat  inner bottoms against your soles. The other pair dipped slightly in the center and helped keep your foot from slipping sideways.  It's not really a problem, but I slightly favored the other pair. UPDATE: In less than 8 months of use, the rubber outer-sole has separated from the slipper about a third of the way back.  The rubber was not even glued to the slipper body.  The only thing holding it on is stitching around the edge with fine thread.  Between the rubber and the body is a layer of thin cardboard-like material, so it would be impossible to glue the parts back together.  These are headed for the trash.	2015-08-09

I was somewhat concerned with the reviewers who found them uncomfortably narrow. One of my feet is narrower than the other so I wondered how my normal foot would feel wearing them. I needn't have worried because these Teva flip-flops mold to the length and width of each of your feet. In other words, they customize themselves to each individual foot. I have worn them nonstop since receiving them 2 or 3 weeks ago. I like this particular style, Olowahu, because they stay on your feet. They have never slipped off my feet no matter what I'm doing -- up and down stairs, walking fast, driving -- no problems. However, I have never tried running while wearing them. I can't run anyway.	2015-08-09

Love love love the style but as has already been noted they are narrow even though I ordered a wide size At first I could barely get them on. Determinedly and since I did not wish to return them I have been wearing them to stretch them out even though painful; one foot more so. The synthetic material does not stretch much but just enough to wear them but these shoes will be for occasional use only, I am afraid although wearable in my mostly sedentary work environment. Update: I am stretching them using an old fashioned shoe stretcher; maybe it will help!	2015-08-09

I have several pairs of Fit Flop sandals, and it has gotten to the point where I do not like any other shoes.

So far, I am in the &#34;love&#34; camp.  At nearly 69 and over forty years of running, climbing, backpacking, and triathlons, I am in the twilight of my running days.  Knees and back are both pretty bad, and I was really struggling with even 10 miles a week before getting the Hoka Odyessey.  I am not breaking PR's now and don't expect to, but I find the light weight and extra cushioning has at least allowed me to run with a more natural gait instead of shuffling; it also seems by knee and back pain, though not gone by any means, is not nearly as severe as before.  I like them a lot; it would be nice if they were more reasonably prices, but luckily I can afford that investment for running shoes that will extend my favorite exercise for at least a while.  I know some people complain about how fast they wear out, but I doubt that will be a major issue since I am not running as extensively as I used to.	2015-08-09

Let me start by saying I have not been a fan of this brand or specific shoe in the past. I purchased the wave rider 14 and 15 two years in a row after the recommendation of a running store. I hated every step in them and actually hot tendinitis in my knee from the shoe stiffness and lack of support. When I purchased the 17's I was a bit hesitant but after the reviews from women's running and actual runners I decided to give them a try. I'm so glad I did!!! I absolutely love them and the price was perfect. I usually love a good stability shoe that is flexible in the ball of the foot with arch support. This shoe provides exactly that. The support around the arch is amazing and the shoe is flexible and light so you can feel the ball of the foot when you run. I run with inserts but knew as soon as I put them on they were just my style. I purchased a 8 and probably could have gone down a half a size. I have only done one 6 mile run in them but I would recommend them to anyone who is a fan of the same type of shoe I like.	2015-08-09

The \\\"rocker\\\\\" soles are causing some problems, but I think I might be able to get used to them.  I have a slight problem with balance, and I find that it's exacerbated by these.<br /><br />The fit is OK -- they're just a tiny bit snug when I wear heavier socks, but otherwise they're fine (I ordered my usual size).  And the color (I chose the taupe) is nice, very close to the photo.  They're easy to get on, too -- something I have to consider due to some physical limitations.<br /><br />There's not a lot of arch support at all, and I found them getting increasingly uncomfortable the more I wore them.  Maybe OK for a couple of hours or so, but I can't image wearing these all day.  Again, this might improve the more I wear them, especially if I can find some arch supports that will fit without making the shoes feel too small.<br /><br />Overall, I'm still just not quite sure what to make of these.  I'll continue to wear them -- not every day -- and see if I can get more comfortable with them.  As it is, though, they're just \\\\\"OK.\\\\\""	2015-08-09

Good replacement for my lenses I scratched on my wiley x sunglasses. They are slightly smaller than the originals, so they snap into the frames much easier and they have a little play.

These lenses are ansi z80.3, so they do not have the markings on the lenses themselves so if your work inspects them closely they won't pass muster.

The  4 zipper pockets along the outside of the bag are useful for separating shoes, medications, liquids, when using as a carry on.  This bag can be used either as a carry on or a checked bag, I've never been questioned on it.  I have also used my old bags on every car trip since purchasing them.<br /><br /> It came with a large make up bag (attached, as shipped by the manufacturer).  The colors are beautiful and the long strap is consistent with my old bags.  Great quality, great price, what more can you ask for.	2015-08-09

They practically look new, just a few scuffs on the instep from bumping my feet during a lazy turnover. They do not protect your feet from getting wet, so consider that if you live in a rainy area, and they're too slick to be used as trail shoes. They are durable, confortable, supportive (I run from the ball of my foot) and lightweight.	2015-08-09

They all fit, but there was a lot of extra room, and it is just a little too long to drag in and out of work every day.  I have now started using it as my weekend/short trip bag.

After reading many reviews on Amazon, and after looking at the website of the company that makes these boots, I decided to purchase them.  I purchased one half size down from what I normally wear (7.5) as directed by other reviewers.  It didn't take long for them to arrive on my doorstep, and when I tried them on, they fit wonderfully.  I wore them to the stable and walked around for a couple of hours, rode in them, and showered off my horse afterward.  Riding in them was less restrictive than my paddock boots and half chaps because they are very flexible.  My feet didn't get too warm and, after I pulled my boots off at home later, I didn't even have smelly feet!  I was impressed at the ability of these boots to wick away moisture.  There was also no break in time at all and they are very easy to clean.  I received a couple of compliments on them because they look more refined than a typical pair of boots.  I am very happy with my purchase and feel the price was not only worth it, but comparable to the popular muck boots I see my fellow stable mates wearing.	2015-08-09

I bought this tote because I wanted a casual,  sporty bag that would go great with my jeans and boots which I wear almost every day! I love everything about it. It's very lightweight (made out of nylon) so after I put all my stuff in it, it's not extra heavy. It has a wide cross body strap that's nylon too so that the strap doesn't bite into my back and shoulder and it distributes the weight really well. The tote is very spacious and the front pocket is spacious too,  I can fit my keys, sunglasses and my giant mega phone perfectly in the front pocket and still have room for more. Plus it has a zippered pocket on the backside which is roomy too. I think this would make a great gym bag, travel bag, or just a everyday run around bag that's good looking and easy to load up with your stuff and be on the go. My new tote is a nice dark rich looking Navy blue, I'm planning on ordering another one in black too. After all, the price is right and so is the quality.  Scarleton you did it again, great price, great quality and great looks!	2015-08-09

The silver glitter is subtle enough for an adult, but exciting enough for a kid.  I also tend to like silver glitter shoes because they match more.  These act very much as running shoes and def &#34;look&#34; that way.  So unlike some other shoes we wouldn't wear these with every-day style dresses.  I also am not personally a fan of Saucony (just no affiliation to the brand and feel it's old ppl's running shoes) but I couldn't find other shoes like this so we tried them and I'm pretty happy.	2015-08-09

While these shoes are a bit short, I can still wear them comfortably all day. I always order a half size smaller in flats and especially canvas shoes.  Otherwise they gap at the sides, so it is not a surprise that they start feeling short after wearing them all day. I'm sure that is due, in part, to the fact that one's feet tend to swell at the end of the day. They are very cute and I get compliments all the time.  They go very well with shorts and casual pants and are very smart looking with black and white outfits.  While there is no arch support or padding in the foot bed, they are still comfortable.	2015-08-09

So I was looking for a boot that would give me solid ankle support, maximum water protection, and durability to be able to sustain for a full days work.  After testing out several different brands of shoes I stumbled upon the Lowa Innox and I have to say it has been the answer to all of my needs and then some.  The comfort level is amazing.  I work for a very rigorous outdoor company that has me in rain, mud, mountains, creeks and more and these boots have stood up to the test and have kept my feet not only dry but comfortable.  I've put them on in the morning and worn them for an 18hour work day and never gave them a thought.  I've submerged them ankle deep in mud and then again in water to clean them off on several occasions and not so much as a drop of water has gotten through.  They have trekked up and down mountains and I'm  thinking that I could actually run a race with these on because that's how comfortable they feel.  I switched out the insole immediately like I do with all boots and put in one that  was more familiar and that was it.  Even though they came with a solid price tag when I've seen my coworkers walking around with boots that were supposedly waterproof dumping pools out of there shoes these have proven they were well worth it.  These have set the standard indeed.	2015-08-09

My fiance really enjoyed the performance of these shoes when he bought his original pair.  He plays floor hockey every day, indoor gym and outdoor cement ring.  The sport is extremely taxing on his shoe soles (ball of foot, not heel).  He has spent upwards of $180(CAN) to find a performance shoe that will stay intact (they broke after a month).  The only ones that have lasted have been these Mizuno Wave Rider 17 shoes.  When I saw the price offered here, it wasn't even a question:  2 more pairs purchased!  They arrived as expected, and we received exactly what we wanted!	2015-08-09

Huge fan of these cute shoes for my 11 month old who just started walking. He is in a weird stage between crib shoes and real shoes that we can find in his size and these are pretty much the perfect compromise. The quality is great, no ratty stitching or crooked lines. Were very easy to put on with a really wide opening to get any chubby foot in and they secure well. The &#34;laces&#34; are just elastic which is great not to have to fumble tying or worrying about him tripping if they came undone (at this age anyways). I did buy them a little big so he wouldn't get only a months use out of them and yet they still fit fairly well.<br />There is a good chance I will buy another pair of these if they hold up well with use, as I assume they will.	2015-08-09

My husband loves &#34;sporty&#34; looking sunglasses, so I though I'd get these for him. They fit my husband's big head well. They are a lot lighter than I was expecting, and don't seem very sturdy. The lens is secured to the top of the frame, but not to the bottom. The lens can separate from the bottom of the frame, and you can see a gap between the frame and the lens. My husband said he feels he has to be extra careful with the sunglasses because it seems like the lens might pop out. They do a good job in blocking out the sun, but the sunglasses don't seem to be of very good quality.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-09

I wear 10.5 or 11 in most shoes - got these in 11.  If on the line or unsure, one half size up was perfect for me.  Solomon website has a great, specific fit guide with inch measurements to be sure.  Excellent comfort and support in a low shoe.  Very tough toe protection and I prefer the normal laces vs. the other models' quick lace system.  Tongue is very padded and keeps dirt and other trails stuff out of the shoe well.  Arch support is great.  Volume and width is great with plenty of room (yet great, unmoving heel retention).  I have plenty of room if I wanted to add some superfeet or other insoles (but the stock ones are great for me, so I will likely forego aftermarket insoles).  No hotspots or blisters from these for me  - although fit is a very individual thing.	2015-08-09

I've been looking for a decent sized clutch with a wristlet strap for a while. Hobo is my normal goto for bags, but none of theirs was what I was looking for. This Latico clutch is great! It's super soft, has an outside pocket for keys/lip balm/etc, card slots inside, and the zipper section holds my big iPhone 6 plus. I love the color- a muted sea green.<br /><br />I've used this for a week straight so far and pretty much beat the heck out of it. It's been tossed around, shoved in and out of larger bags, and had itself stuffed full. It's fine. The leather does look thin, but that means nothing. Tons of bags have similar construction and last years and years.  It is holding up great and I am very pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />My ONLY suggestion would be to add a second zippered section on the other side for change. =)	2015-08-09

I put these on and felt relief. After the first week, my feet are a bit sore. This is mainly due to my feet having to use different muscles than before but I can tell that these shoes will be the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought for work. There is not a lot of cushion in these shoes. I don't really think that is necessary with the footbed and support provided.<br />The slip resistance soles are good on wet floors but leaves a lot to be desired of oily ones. What I really like is the the fact that the soles don't accumulate food particles. All other shoes I've worn in the past have had so much junk in them by the end of the day, I could feed a small country with them and they struggle to keep me from slipping anyway.<br />The build quality and materials on these  shoes is exceptional but what would you expect from a name like Birkenstock. The only thing I can knock these shoes for it appearance. They look like clogs (or as I'm told, like black clown shoes). I normally buy a my professional looking shoe. That being said, I would  buy these again in the future because of the comfort.	2015-08-09

I went to the Croc Store and tried on shoes. Size 7 fit great, so I ordered size 7 for these shoes. It was way too big! There was about 3/4 inch of space between my heel and the strap. I had to return it and order again in a smaller size. I'll leave another review when that arrives.  REVISED REVIEW: After exchanging the size 7s for size 6s, I wasn't immediately convinced by these shoes. I tried wearing them while waitressing to break them in. They were a little small and uncomfortable and gave me unpleasant blisters, even when I wore them with socks, which wasn't a good look by the way.  Then, I left to live in Thailand for 1 year, and let me tell ya, these shoes were PERFECT for Thailand. No need for socks, waterproof, easy to clean, and passable in a professional workplace setting. Whether it was the heat or the fact I wore them so much, these shoes stretched out a little and molded perfectly to my feet. If they stretched out too much, I would put them in the sun on my balcony to shrink them and they would fit nice and perfect again. And they were easy to clean, whether they got dusty while walking around town or covered in mud during a monsoon. Just an old toothbrush, some dish soap, and water did the trick.  One thing I didn't like about them is the decorative flower near the ankle. It made it incredibly uncomfortable to kneel or sit on the floor with my legs crossed.  Also, do avoid walking in puddles with these. By month 8, I wore them so much that the bottoms lost their traction, which made walking in even shallow puddles super dangerous.   After my job finished, I kept wearing these shoes for 2 more months while traveling around Southeast Asia. Aside from the pros I already mentioned, they are lightweight and easy to match with different outfits which makes them great for travel.   Overall a great pair of shoes. I would buy them again for the next time I live and work in Southeast Asia.	2015-08-09

Some tend to be difficult to break in. This is not one of them.  Out of the box, they are comfortable.  The padding on the insole is soft and cushioning.  It has a memory from feel.  My only complaint, like many others is that it is not what is picture.  The color on Amazon is listed as Grey/Blue,  on the box, it reads Grey/Blue (GBF). The difference is significant.  Looking at DC's website, they show only the shoe I received and do not have the model colors shown by Amazon.  If DC has changed the model, Amazon should updated the picture.  There are enough reviews stating the issue that Amazon should be aware of it.  Aside from that,  I like the shoe, I would prefer the colors shown, but like them enough to keep them.	2015-08-09

Never in my life have I had this much pain with shoes. Horrendous piercing pain with my arches, my toes cramped up, the fabric tag liner on top of the shoe scraping against the top of my foot.... I wanted to cry when I walked to my car after my clinical rotation. I wore them twice (but bought them months in advance) and they are by far, the most painful shoes I've EVER had the displeasure of wearing. My friend bought the same one as me and the bottom of her sole fell off on day 1. Horribly made! Some of my colleagues had mentioned their feet felt fine, but certainly not mine. Go for the sketchers memory foam. They're cheaper and you'll feel like you're walking on a cloud. I practically begged amazon for a return and thankfully, they helped me out.	2015-08-09

US	9887956	R2C2WX2461ZUT	B007FY13NC	837136823	FRYE Elaine Vintage Antique Pull-Up Backpack	Shoes	5	1	1	N	N	A great bag--looks beautiful and is so versatile...so happy with it!	I have several purses made by Frye and I am always happy with the quality and durability of their leather, as well as the construction and look of their bags...they have never let me down. I had been looking at this handbag/backpack as well as the larger Josie model, and going back and forth between the two trying to decide which would fit my needs (and my budget) better--I finally went ahead and purchased this one when it recently went on sale for a very good price. I have to admit I probably would never buy an item like this at the regular price so I am always watching for sales when I shop for this type of splurge. I got this in &#34;Smoke&#34; which is unlike any other bag I own--it is dark, but not solidly one color; it is truly a variegated mix of deep brown and black, but it also looks all black or all brown depending on the lighting. The finish on the leather gives it a vintage look and what I can only describe as a certain depth to the color, which is just beautiful. I would classify this as either a medium-sized purse (relative, I know, but if one calls a typical cross-body bag small and a traditional tote-bag large this might give some idea as to whether it might be appropriate) or a small-sized backpack--maybe 3/4 size? (compared to the standard backpack high-school/college students might carry). The description included the dimensions, but somehow that only gives me a general idea of what to expect...the bag actually turned out to be a bit smaller than I expected from the picture showing a model carrying it--which I am happy about as it is just perfect for me. I will most likely be using this as a backpack most of the time and it is easy to position and carry and it is not at all awkward put on or take off (yeah, I was worried about that). It isn't too bulky and doesn't get in the way and the straps are located so that the bag remains balanced even when loaded. I bought it to use for work, but I can see that it would also be great for travel, leaving hands free to corral other belongings, luggage, toddlers, you name it...<br />Very happy with my purchase and I know I will be using this for years!	2015-08-09

Should have pay more attention to the other reviewers. :(. I normally wear an 8 1/2 so I ordered a 9.  It is too snug for goal comfort.

They didn't have a 9.5 available in the color I wanted otherwise I would have returned.  A full size larger than my norm is a huge surprise for such a pricy shoe!

I like this much better than I thought I would!  The only thing is the pockets on the sides are not large enough for my cell phone which is a Samsung Note 4.  It is a larger phone.  But it fits nicely in the front pocket along with my Kindle Paperwhite reader.  The front pocket is more secure than you might think.  This appears to be a very study bag and should wear well.	2015-08-09

The shoes came just be for a trip so I didn't get to wear them before i left. the first use was on a beach and ocean area. After about 2 hours without socks. I got a couple blisters on my oustide toes. Wearing socks is a must for any long walks. The sole came loose from the upper after about 4 uses. I did have to use Gorilla Glue to keep them together. After that the shoes have been great. Before gluing and wearing socks I'd rate them a 1 star. But with socks and fixing the seperation I rate them a 4. I would order again but would get some use in before a trip to make sure they can stand up to the wear.	2015-08-09

Pretty small and feminine.	In person, this canvas bag look a lot more like a purse, so I probably wouldn't recommend this for guys.  However, it's big enough for a small laptop or tablet along with plenty of other items.  The color, in person, looks like an olive/brown.  The leather tag on the front reads &#34;ANDELIYA&#34; and the decorative, brown leather strap on the front is embossed with the words &#34;andeliya xiu xian bag&#34;.<br /><br />The front flap reveals a medium sized pocket along with a smaller zippered pocket.  The main compartment is also zippered and has two small side pockets for phones or pens and another small zippered pocket, big enough for a small wallet or a phone.  The back of the bag has yet another small, zippered pocket that would fit a larger phone or wallet.<br /><br />The canvas construction feels pretty thick and sturdy, but inner lining feels pretty thin.  The canvas strap is attached to metal hardware held on by leather pieces sewn onto the canvas bag.  It all feels pretty sturdy and well constructed.  The leather strap across the front, bottom is purely decorative.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty nice bag, but I think it looks a lot more feminine in person than it does in the pictures.  I'm docking one star just because of the weird branding.  A thicker lining on the interior would have been nice too.  I received this bag for free in exchange for an honest review.	2015-08-09

I'm on my second pair because my dog ate the first pair and I was so impressed with them that I immediately went out and bought another pair.  They'e incredibly comfortable.  I find that I can walk all day long in them.  They're open enough that they keep my feet cool, yet they offer a lot more protection than found in many sandals.  I especially like the toe protection.  If you get them dirty, it's no problem, they wash up easily.  My current pair I've had for about a year and they still look new and show very little signs of wear despite daily wear.  The only thing that I've found that I didn't expect is that they don't offer great traction on wet surfaces.  I've found they slip pretty easily.  On the other hand, you can get them wet and it doesn't bother them a bit.	2015-08-09

I would have preferred a fancier shoe on my wedding day, but we got married outside at a wedding barn and I needed a flat(ish) shoe so the heel wouldn't get stuck in the dirt.  Well, turns out it was really cold and wet the day of our wedding so we did everything inside.. but who really cares about a shoe you can't see?<br /><br />The shoe was cute, formal.. but I have wide feet so I needed to break them in a bit before the wedding by wearing them around the house with socks.  I think this would be a great shoe for prom or homecoming, but a little too informal for everyday wear.	2015-08-09

I was always a Converse girl. My Chucks and I were inseparable. As an adult, I wanted to find footwear that was just as comfortable, but a little more mature looking. So I tried Sanuks. First, I bought the June Bugs and absolutely loved them. Then I bought a pair of the Shortys, and they were great. Now, I decided to try the Dottys. They fit just as perfectly as the other two pairs, and they are adorable - c'mon, they have polka dots! I feared the polka dots would make them look a little too &#34;young,&#34; but they don't. They are noticeable, but not boldly so. Just cute enough. Sanuks have become my new Converse, basically the only shoes I wear anymore. The poor Chucks now live in the back of my closet, barely seeing the light of day. I still love them, but nothing compares to Sanuks. Nothing.	2015-08-09

Problem with this shoe is that it is very hard and kind of doesn't give you really support for your back. You cannot wear this for long time cause it really hurts the back part of your foot. The sole in this shoe was torn within a year. Its not that great of a shoe. Its just a good looking shoe. And now it splits open from the sides but I don't think its a defect its just three years is enough to use such a shoe :D. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	2015-08-09

Very well cushioned sandal for those of us who dislike the thong design (I walk on my toes, so I tend to pull the thongs out). Let's be honest,  sometimes you need to wear socks with sandals - I do it when I need to quickly transition between muddy shoes and the sandals and back again. You can't do that with thong sandals, you can with these. They stay snug on my feet. The size is a bit smaller than the same size in shoes, but this is probably a good thing for sandals since you can trip over them if they have any room.  Make sure you break these in before judging - it takes several days for these to mould to your feet.	2015-08-09

The problem with them was that they broke when I was going up a set of steps. I was wearing them in my house, like I do with all new shoes, to break them in. So....I went down stairs to check on some laundry, and everything was fine. But....when I came back up the steps, one shoe broke. It split on the outside of the toe area. I'm glad that it happened before I wore them to the event I had planned them for. I have several other pairs of Ivanka Trump leather pumps, and there has never been any problem. I have several other pairs of patent leather pumps by other manufacturers, and there has never been any problems. I guess I just got a bad pair, so I sent them back.

I was looking for a pair of polarized sunglasses, after my other pair (from a different company) broke.  I have a small face, so I was looking for a pair that was smaller.  I found these on Amazon, in my favorite color, and thought they were perfect.<br /><br />These fit like a dream, and I love how they wrap around slightly.  After having a pair of polarized sunglasses for years, I can't wear regular ones anymore.  Polarized glasses eliminate so much outside glare and make it so much easier to see on a bright day.  These glasses live up to that expectation.  They are so trendy and cute.  They are also very sturdy and I love the zipper case they come in.  They also come with a cloth bag that you can use to clean them with.  The rubber grips on the ears make them stay perfectly in place.  They almost feel like I am not wearing sunglasses, they are that comfortable.<br /><br />These glasses are perfect, and I would rate them 10 stars if I could.  If you are looking for high quality, polarized sunglass that are trendy, cute and stylish, then these are perfect!	2015-08-09

I loved the leather back as it felt soft and buttery; the canvas material is durable and rugged and the zippers are very hefty and heavy duty. The inside made organization extremely easy. It provide generous room along with 2 nice sized pockets and the zippered hidden pocket is very deep and roomy. The lining is high quality and has very good stitching, which looks like it will be durable over a long time. I also loved the front snap pocket with rings, which I used to attach my key ring carabiner to, and the leather zipped pocket offered lots of room and security yet easy access. The heavy webbing strap was adjustable to either over the shoulder or across the front and very comfortable. The metal claps for the strap are strong and solid. It is a tiny bit heavier than I expected but that is b/c the quality of the fabric is so good. I would recommend it for a man or woman as it is casually unisex, practical and very durable.	2015-08-09

This one is very close to what that after 5  years of wearing them I can no longer see out of them.  The frames took a beating from me, the paint eventually chipped off a bit but it took years of hard use.  They were so lightweight on my nose that the glasses left weightless  The heavier glasses I have now are irritating after wearing glasses I could barely feel on my face, so, A plus for comfort.<br />Secondly, I was stopped in streets and markets and asked &#34;where did you get those glasses&#34; because they were striking.  They looked different from what anyone else was wearing.  They were European and chic compared to the clunky styles in the frame shop.  Lastly, I am sold on the rimless glasses now because I felt visibility was better without the lines of a frame blocking some of the vision.  I've missed those glasses terribly, and will definitely buy this brand again and probably this style or something very near to it	2015-08-09

The sole is unforgiving hard rubber, with very little support or cushioning. Heel cup nice but arch felt different in each shoe. Holes in ankle strap did not go through strap & had to be pierced.  Strap across front very stiff & cut across top of foot.  Tried to adjust front & while there is buckle & strap, there is a wide piece of elastic sewn underneath holding the two sides together.  There is some give with this, but since the strap is very stiff, not enough to be comfortable.  Pretty leather - a bright shiny gold. Tried wearing them around the house but could only stand it for about 30 mins.  Very disappointed.  May try other style of Vionics but this pair of sandals is being returned.	2015-08-09

I love them because they fit my foot perfectly with hardly any break-in.  Every boot I've ever worn took some time to break in, and even the best ones would still give me heel blisters after hard hunting or hiking, especially anything over a days worth of hiking.  The heel cup in these is cut for a thin ankle, and they don't let your heel lift like a lot of boots that are really comfy when you try them on at the store.  My foot is very boney, thin, and with a very high arch.  I did put some high arch insoles in mine which also help with the fit and heel lift.  The ones that come with the boot kinda suck in my opinion.  The build quality on these is excellent as well, with one piece leather construction, stitch down sole. I've got a few hundred miles on mine and the lugs on the sole are a little rounded off but still good for a few hundred more miles.  They aren't the most water proof boots, mainly because of their height, but other than that they are all I thought they would be and more.  I hope to own them for at least 20 years.	2015-08-09

Upon arrival I had her try them on immediately. She loves them and they are actually made from really thick materials which is more than I expectd. They fit her perfectly and I actually ordered a half size up from her regular shoe size, so I would advise doing that. Great shoes and super cute design, love them!

Ordered these thru another Merchant and they didn't carry half sizes.  So, I settled for a 9M... Wasn't comfortable enough for me.  So... I search everywhere for this Bandolino Mirabella pump and I found it on Amazon...they had exactly the size of needed.  So Happy About That!  I have this Style in Pink too.

What I like about it the most is that is doesn't by have any cheap feeling too it, I would say they do run a tiny bit small. I originally wear a 7 - 7 1/2  but I got a size 8 and it fit perfectly ! So I would recommend getting a bigger size just to be safe! The shoes looked pretty stable . I love the feeling to it as well. Just don't be rough with them on because they do have an accessory on them which is the bow, so if you don't want it to come off be careful :) I will buy again in different color . I WILL BE WRITING ANOTHER REVIEW IF IT BREAKS OR ANY DAMAGE LIKE THAT.	2015-08-09

They were ADORABLE!  Perfect color style and look. And, suede (had been looking for the right BOB suede shoes for some time). GREAT sale price. And, it seemed they would be comfortable too.  EXACTLY what I wanted. One problem....  The shoe box was labeled size &#34;9 - 1/2&#34; (the size I ordered).  However, the shoes IN THE BOX were size 10. Of course, I had to return them (SADLY).  And, (SADLY) there are no more size 9-1/2 to reorder. I am beyond disappointed. Booohoooooooo.  Giving the shoes 5 stars (because they deserve it).  Love Amazon but have to give them only ONE STAR on this one. .  Update:  returned the shoes... (as noted above.. shoe box marked size 9 1/2 (the size I ordered).  The shoes IN THE BOX size 10.  I watched and waited... saw there was finally another size pair 9 1/2 in stock!  Ordered.  Just received the SAME pair back again!!!!  Size 9 1/2 marked box, size 10 shoes INSIDE the box.  Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I see it was a total waste of time to tape a GIANT NOTE, warning Amazon returns, that the shoes inside the box were the wrong size!  NO stars for Amazon.	2015-08-09

I bought these glasses for my son....he has been looking for a pair just like these. He even has to fight the dog for them...LOL.  I consider them kinda a Blues Brothers Look. They are made very well and the lenses are nice and dark. These glasses really protect your eyes from the sun. The lenses are designed to eliminate reflective glare and to protect against harmful UVA and UVB rays. The also reduce eyestrain and eye fatigue by eliminating the frequent adjustments that the eyes must make when exposed to the glare. I would highly recommend these glasses to others. I am glad that I had the opportunity to review these glasses at a discounted price for my honest review.	2015-08-09

It is a good concept, but was so poorly executed that it results in much worse problems than what it was &#34;designed&#34; to solve. The idea is that you can clip the case to an interior pocket of your purse and have your glasses at the ready. The problem is the clip does not stay attached to the case. It is a piece of plastic that doesn't have any way to secure itself to the case, so the case just falls off the clip down into your purse, the very problem you are trying to solve. It is bizarre that they would fail in the VERY THING it is supposed to solve. How hard would it be to permanently attach the clip or design it to stay securely to the glasses case. DO NOT BUY.	2015-08-09

I finally had to purchase lock laces.  They work better now, but I don't understand why they didn't have lock laces to begin with if they are to be used in the water.  When the laces constantly come untied, it is not only annoying, but also unsafe.	2015-08-09

Be wary of what you receive..<br /><br />I purchased the Ray-Ban RB2132 52M Black Polarized direct from Amazon.com, however I received the box open and held together by Scotch tape. The sticker was not present, nor were the plastic sleeves that should be on the hinges (these are not my first pairs of Ray-Bans). Not only did they look like they have been used, they also make a creaking noise indicating they might be fake.<br /><br />I purchased these to replace an aging pair of the same glasses which I bought direct from the Ray-Ban/Luxottica website. These are fantastic sunglasses that are stylish and functional, which I totally recommend, but because they are very popular, there are many fakes. Upon receiving these, definitely check for genuineness to make sure you got your money's worth. Even Amazon itself can slip up.	2015-08-09

They have a nice lining in them, and are easy to put on and take off. Perfect for baby's who don't walk, or are learning to walk. I think the designs are great, and the price is great too.<br /><br />  Although I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, I think these shoes are a great buy.

I ordered the 8 first but my ankle slipped out a bit and they felt too roomy in the toe area. The footbed was really comfy though and I like the color (dark red) and the style - they go with skirts and pants equally well. So I ordered the 7.5 for comparison. The 7.5 seemed too cosy but they were still slightly loose around the ankle - I have narrow ankles so this is probably just me. Because of the price of the shoe (not cheap) I couldn't keep either pair because neither fit me well enough. The 7.5 might have stretched and conformed to my foot, but I didn't want to take the chance.	2015-08-09

And their flip flops have been for favorite until my last purchase.<br /><br />The quality was comparable to past flip flops that I've bought from Camper. However, these size 44 that I bought we smaller than my older ones. I wore them longer before I verified with my older pair. My toes overhang the front. And the footbed does not have the same ergonomic support that the previous ones had. Could be a different model, but they look pretty identical. Also, the soles don't seem to hold up as well. My weight hasn't changed in 10 years, but these ones seem to not hold up as well and I've only worn them a few times.<br /><br />I'm just dissatisfied with these sandals.

I have 14 pairs in my closet (just counted), all New Balance. Now my size is 13 4e, which for all the world is 12 3e.<br />  NB is still the best I can find, fo fit.<br />  The quality is down, and the uppers seperate from the sole after long use.<br />  The leather is stiffer and takes more break in, but do become comfy. I do favor the 624 and wore out many of them on car lots over 20 years. I think the 510 trail are better quality than these 410 model, but still happy.  I am a bit angry, that when i saw these at $44.95 and was placing the order for two pair the price changed to $64.95. I did not notice till delivery e-mail notifications came. In fact the next day Amazon said they had one pair left at $44.95. I ordered them and got them at $44.95.  This price changing many times a day has me looking at other local and online options. My loyalty and trust of over 2 decades has taken a beating.<br />  Rich.<br /><br />WATCH YOUR BACK......	2015-08-09

I am writing this review on August 9, 2015.  I do fitness walking, averaging around 100 miles a month.  I rotate three different brands of shoes so these shoes have seen less than 100 miles of use since they were purchased.  They have so little cushioning on the inside part of the heel that they wore thru & the plastic heel support started rubbing against the back of my heels during my walk yesterday.  I regularly walk in Brooks & Asics & I have never had this problem.  Although these shoes were very comfortable & supportive initially & certainly qualify as a lightweight shoe, I would not buy them again due to this durability issue.  So I am back to looking for a third brand to mix in the rotation.  Any suggestions?	2015-08-09

As a person who needs to carry a lot in my purse, I find this bag perfect. In fact, I own three of them in different color combinations and would love to get a couple more. The leather is soft and sumptuous but also substantial in its thickness. Touch it once and you will instantly know that this is a high quality bag. The feet and the studs or rivets that hold the handle are faceted, a nice little touch. The clips on the removable crossbody strap are beautifully made. Please note that the zipper pouch is supposed to ride in the front pocket, shown in ivory here. It is a perfect fit. Note, however, that if your bag turned upside down, it may fall out. After months of use that way,  I almost lost it in a supermarket last week, so now it rides inside where it is safer. I use it to carry important papers; I find it very useful for that. The ends of the zipper are anchored so you never have to hold onto them to open or close the bag. The design is simple and timeless. You'll never be looking at it and sneering, &#34;It's so 2015!&#34;<br /><br />I have read other reviews of this bag on QVC and will summarize complaints that others have: Crossbody strap too thin, cuts into shoulder. Bag too big to be a crossbody bag. Bag is too heavy, empty. Bag is too big. Opening at the top not big enough. A few people got a bag with a zipper that stuck. Some objected to the lining fabric, which feels like cotton and is a pattern of royal blue and emerald green. They felt it was too dark, making the bag feel like &#34;a black hole.&#34;<br /><br />None of these complaints are relevant to me. I never use the crossbody strap; the shorter one is a great length to go over my shoulder, and it is wide enough to be very comfortable. I don't find the bag heavy except when I over fill it. The opening at the top has always been plenty big for my use, and I put some big things in there at times. The zippers on my three bags have been smooth and easy to use.<br /><br />The last thing you should be aware of, is that this is, and was designed to be a color blocked bag. Both of the straps on these bags are black in every color combination that I know of. The zipper pouch is always a totally contrasting color. The indigo bag has a blush pink pouch. My seafoam green bag has a gray pocket and a rich brown pouch, etc. So you are getting four different colors of leather regardless of the colorway you choose. I have liked every color combination I've seen, but if this bothers you, this bag isn't for you.<br /><br />I have been carrying this bag in pale seafoam green for a number of months now, and it still looks pristine. I have every reason to expect it to last as long as I do. (I'm 60.) I love this bag so much, and it is so perfect for my needs, that I honestly think I'll be carrying it for the rest of my life. Which is why I keep collecting new colors!	2015-08-09

I asked his mom and she said they're Native and loves them. So that night I ordered it on Amazon. Since I have not bought shoes for my kids in months, I carefully measured their feet and followed Native's product sizing. I ordered a 7 for my daughter and 9 for my son. When I received the products, my daughter's shoes were just right for her feet, with a little room for growth. However my son's was too big so I ended up exchanging it for a size smaller. Nevertheless, these shoes are absolutely 110% comfortable, nicely constructed and looks great on kids! I am in love with these shoes. I just wished I got them earlier in the summer!!!	2015-08-09

You could go hiking in them in terrain that's not overly rough.  Other reviews that say they run a little large are accurate--I usually wear a size 9, but ordered a half size smaller based on the reviews and they fit perfectly lengthwise.  Over the course of a full day, they might feel a little tight across the instep, but it's easy to resolve by just loosening the strap a bit.  No slippage or discomfort at the heel like so many other sandals I've worn.  Definitely recommended.  Update 5-23-2016:  I liked the brown pair that I bought last summer so much that I ordered and just received another pair in black, at a nice discount and free same-day delivery through Amazon Prime.  Again, I ordered a half-size down from my usual size, and they fit great.  Remember that you'll have to experiment with the ankle strap to find the happy spots for your ankles, but once you're there, you're walking forever in these.	2015-08-09

These shoes fit better than I had hoped for and were in my price range. I tend to supinate and this is the first shoe that has supported my probation and kept me on the balls of my feet. I work at the gym so I am on my feet for a good chunk of my day and do various activities in my shoes. Although these are lightweight, I feel supported. Medium support when tied and strapped moderately, but when I need full support I crank back the strap and tighten the strings a bit and am good to go. I have never felt like the strap is &#34;flapping in the wind.&#34; I would recommend these and will probably look at buying another pair when these wear out.	2015-08-09

A good fit for me, I unfortunately didn't notice till it was too late that it would only come up to the top of my ankle and not mid calf.  I work 12-16 hour shifts and I am very happy with the quality of this product.  Would I buy again, no.  Only reason is I require taller boots for working electrical in rain and snow.  Accidents happen and I don't want to be the one rushed to the hospital.  I do not wear these specific boots when working outside for extended periods of time during foul weather conditions.  I swap to my Redwings.  The grip of the sole is good even under slippery conditions, not great but good.  I have tried waterproofing the leather and it helped immensely in keeping the leather clean.  Won't waterproof my foot under any conditions, these are not designed for that.  The ankle support is decent considering it only holds up the ankle not surrounds it.	2015-08-09

I am flummoxed by people saying they are too heavy.... I have worn orthopedic shoes for over 30 years, have nerve and vascular issues along with arthritis and some muscle weakness, and I do not find them too heavy. They do have heavy soles, heavier than, say, running shoes, but I am unable to wear shoes without strong lateral stability, so I guess I am used to it. (Maybe people are offended by the box saying &#34;featherlight&#34; but my guess is these may not be people used to wearing therapeutic shoes of this nature) They are really cute compared to most clunky orthopedic shoes, though yes they are still a little clunky. I like the ability to adjust the heel tightness. One small reservation, you can't slip in and out of them, and while putting on, the strap can easily slip inside the T part and can be a little hard to fish out or re-thread into it. If you want to compare the fit of these to other Drew shoes, their website shows the last number and you can search on that number and turn up others with the same last.	2015-08-09

I bought these shoes based on the positive Amazon rating and on recommendations from friends. I was a bit wary about buying them sight unseen over the internet, especially given that they are by no means cheap, but decided I could return if needed.<br /><br />Wow, these shoes are fantastic! I put them on and immediately ran a 5k. The difference between these and my old shoes (which were, admittedly, probably 10 years old) was like night and day. These fit and cushion so well that my feet barely felt tired after the 5k. I've never had a pair of shoes that I could just put on and immediately start using like that before. I've now been running 5k's 2-3 times per week for the month since I got them, and feel the price was well worth them helping me get back into it again.	2015-08-09

I usually take an 8 but ordered a half size larger so I can wear thin socks with them.  They fit fine.  I usually take a medium width and these seem ok to me.

Just hold the back flap straight and they go right on.  Can't speak to the waterproof part...no rain as yet.	2015-08-09

But after trying them on<br />I know I won't have a problem stretching them out. I purchased the grey, blue, pink and red. All the colors were as shown. Do I think they are going to last? NO...cheap quality, But I got what I paid for them! And I'm ok with that, I'll us them until I can't no more. Overall a great buy.	2015-08-09

It is fairly supple to the touch and appears to be of better than average quality.  I just can't figure out what it is good for.  It's too small for most laptops which is just as well since it has no padded sleeve or pocket that would protect it.  It might make a fair briefcase but it seems a little small for that job as well.  The interior pockets seemed like more of an after thought rather than an integral part of the design.  I also and not fond of the strap as it is made of nylon rather than leather.  At this price I just expect more.	2015-08-09

It's a bit easier in a store but I have less confidence purchasing online when I don't have the shoe on my feet.  But this time, I decided to order a 6.5 when I wear a 7.5.  The shoe arrived, I put them on, they felt a bit snug but I had ordered some Toms online in a 7.5 and they are now too loose, comfy but too loose and my feet slide to the side too much.

I purchased them for my 4 year old who would wear rain boots every day if I let her!! She put them on immediately after they arrived in the mail and went on and on about how beautiful the flowers are on them. The design really is adorable and versatile as well. They fit true to size and have handles on each side of the boots that help little hands to pull them up. One thing I also noticed is that the soles of these are much more padded and comfortable feeling than other rain boots that she owns.  Hooray for comfy puddle stomping!!! Excellent product at an excellent price!<br /><br />Discounted for review	2015-08-09

So far a pair will last 7-8 months before I need to replace them.  This will be my fourth pair.    I wear a size 8.5 US and a size 8 in these slippers.  The 8 fits perfect and they make such a difference in my foot pain that I have been known to forget I'm wearing them when I go out to run errands.  The rubber soles are good and allow for wearing them outside, but they are not the prettiest of shoes.	2015-08-09

This is a nice striking bag, without being too flashy.  I loved all the neutral straw material.  It is on the large size, which is fine for me. To me, it stands wider and shorter than the picture portrays. See my picture. My only cons are that a divider would help organize a larger bag better, and there were a few loose threads and snagged straw strands (pictures included).  I would have thought it would have been checked and fixed before leaving the manufacturer.  A little disappointed by that, thus the 4 stars.	2015-08-09

I seriously cannot even begin to describe how adorable this little bag is! I gave it to my 16 year old niece as a gift for her birthday, and she fell in love with it the second she saw it, and I can't say that I blame her.<br /><br />This cute little black bag has the perfect little face of a Boston Terrier with heart shaped eyes, a little oval nose, and a tiny pout. The bag is not huge, which makes it perfect for her to carry along just the few daily essentials while she is out and about. There is plenty of room for her to store a hairbrush, some makeup, her wallet, keys and little odds and ends easily.<br /><br />The bag is very well made from what I could tell. I looked it all over up and down before I gave it to her, and I did not find any loose threads or stitching anywhere. The zipper slides open and closed easily and does not stick at all. I received a sample to review and definitely give it two thumbs up! She has gotten a ton of compliments since she started carrying the bag around, she eve had a group of girls stop her in the mall to tell her how cute it was and ask where they could buy one. This is definitely an awesome gift for doggie lovers of any age!	2015-08-09

I’ve owned sunglasses that weren’t polarized, and I can certainly tell the difference between them.<br /><br />The wayfarer style of the frames is a flexible style that looks great on almost all face shapes. These sunglasses come either in black or red, and also come in a soft cloth bag (inside a cardboard box). I decided to get the all black pair since I already have a two-tone red/black wayfarer sunglasses.<br /><br />Mambo Shades boast that these sunglasses are smudge-resistant, moisture repellent, oil, and sun lotion repellent and provide scratch resistance greater than a standard uncoated polycarbonate lens. I’ve noticed that after a week, they certainly do hold up quite well, although they are not entirely smudge-proof. They seem to be more resistant to scratches though, especially since I’m a clumsy person and have already dropped these glasses by accident on more than one occasion.<br /><br />There is one thing I have to mention. The lens size of the sunglasses are a bit smaller in both width and length than traditional wayfarer sunglasses. I’m used to wearing oversized glasses, so these seem to be small in comparison. The overall fit seems to accommodate women better than men, although they’re supposed to be unisex.<br /><br />Still, a great pair of sunglasses. They sunglasses are flat, so they fit perfectly on my flat face and flat nose bridge.<br /><br />A sample was provided at a promotional discount for testing and review.	2015-08-09

My feet are flat, sensitive, wider at the front and narrow at the heel. I have plantar fasciitis and my feet swell during the summer. My job requires me to be on my feet a lot so comfortable shoes are a must. In a wide these sandals are a little too wide but all of the straps are Velcro and adjustable so that is easy to fix. The footbed is comfortable and offers support. But as other reviewers have pointed out it holds odor. These sandals start out comfortable but by the end of the day the strap across my toes is quite painful  over my big toes.	2015-08-09

At best, it is comfortably worn for about 2 hours or so before it becomes problematic. Perhaps this problem is entirely a fluke - I hope - since Bandolino is otherwise a great brand.	2015-08-09

Durability and Aesthetics: Well over a year after owning these, and them borderline having holes in them, I still get compliments on these shoes. (The black ones with a pretty pressed pattern) Strange considering I work in kitchens so half the time they are not exactly clean and beautiful. They are just now breaking down to the point where my feet hurt a little at the end of the day, and they've lasted me through intense work 5 days a week since the first day I owned them.<br /><br />Cons: I wish they were more non-slip. Especially where there are things like oil, water, random food spills, etc creating a potential slip and slide for you at work. The tread wore down fairly quickly and even before it did they weren't actually non-slip. But I sacrificed safety for the comfort and looks of these.<br />And the insides are completely shredded. Bottoms, tops, whole shebang. I didn't put this in durability because it really didn't affect them until they were otherwise unwearable anyway.	2015-08-09

I bought them because I was preparing for a move overseas to a developing country, and wanted something solid that would last a while, would be cool, light, and functional, and could be worn as an &#34;everyday&#34; shoe.  I also bought some girly flats (Crocs also) to wear with dresses and skirts.  Since I arrived 8 months ago, I have worn the girly flats (Crocs) a total of three times.  I wear these flip flops every single day.  In the shower.  Out and about.  Beside the bed every night for sliding on quickly in the morning.  They are completely comfortable, the fit for me is perfect, and despite the tropical summer, I have had no issues with shrinkage.  They're perfect for beach, for a casual street shoe, and while they're not necessarily the prettiest, I prefer wearing them with summer dresses over the flats (the flats cause serious blisters for me because they don't breathe at all).  They are particularly impressive on wet tile -- I have never slipped, which is saying something because during the rainy seasons, the tile patios, floors, and sidewalks can be treacherous.  If there's any complaint, it is simply that I've had to ask a shoe repair guy to sew the toe wedge strap back in to both shoes (left once,  and right once) in the last eight months.  Considering that I wear these as a full time, 24-7 shoe, I can live with the dollar or so I've spent to fix them.  The soles have not broken down at all, and the grippy bottoms are still in great shape.  While I may end up stopping to see my shoe repairman once or twice in the future, I'm sure I've got at least another year left of life in these.	2015-08-09

My son (2/3 years old) loves these shoes and he ALWAYS gets compliments on them. My son is very picky about shoes (they need to be comfy) and other than TOMS, these have been his favorites. We got the blue pair which I think stands out so people are constantly commenting on how cute his shoes are and for some reason people think they are TOmS even though they're faux leather. One down side is that they scuff up really easily. My son loves to climb rocks and sometimes drags his feet so these were basically immediately (literally the first time he wore them out) scuffed out at the toes (faux leather rubbed right off to reveal the tan material underneath). Despite that, people still thought they looked good and since they were cheap, we didn't care that much. He uses them for everyday shoes and they have lasted about 3 months so far over the summer. This includes extensive water exposure including his wet feet inside them and being rinsed out from muddy excursions. The inner sole has come undone in one shoe but easily slips back in and stays in place while in use. We also throw baby powder in there every few weeks because he wears them without socks and they get a funky odor. My son can also slip these on easily by himself which is a major plus.	2015-08-09

About 4 years ago, my podiatrist suggested I get the Spira Genesis II sneakers for women.  I had these and they were great for my flat feet.  (Minimal blisters which are a major problem for me.)  However, those sneakers are no longer made.  So I went on the hunt for new ones.  I found Nike sneakers for women runners and thought they would be great.  To my dismay there was a big problem for me in the heel/ankle area.  My poor heels/ankles are still trying to heal from all the blisters I experienced.  After much research into good running shoes (I mostly use the treadmill and exercise bike for workouts, plus playing tennis) for those with pronation, I found these.  I was rather trepidacious after what my feet had been through so I decided to try them as I walked on the treadmill.  I was thrilled when I finished my workout without any new blisters!  So far, I've had these sneakers for a few weeks now, working out probably 6 times per week.  These sneakers are great, great arch support, I chose a wide width due to the pronation in both me feet and they fit so well.  They also have awesome cushioning which I like and fit well.  They're also pretty lightweight.  I'm really happy with these sneakers.  Thank you Saucony and Amazon!	2015-08-09

I have a big head so these are a bit small for me. However, I like the green square lenses. They are very light which I appreciate.  They appear well made and came with a nice black bag.

We purchased these glassed for our son on a recent trip to Greece. Knowing that he would be out in the sun by the water all day for a week we knew it was important to protect his eyes. I would also suggest a hat too just for added protection.<br />At the time he was 11 months old, and they fit great.  The longest he wore the glasses at one time was about three to four hours, and it didn't seem to bother him. I read on other reviews that it seemed to pinch others noses, but this did not happen with my son at all. I would suggest loosening the head strap slightly to see if that would eliminate the issue or repositioning it on the child’s head. I was hesitant at first because I thought he would just rip the glasses off because they annoyed him, but he didn't really seem to notice the glasses.<br />The frames and head strap are very durable and were so adorable on him too. The velcro is high quality, and even being in the sand and traveling the velcro stayed clean. The color is very accurate to the picture, and the blue is just too perfect for a little guy in my opinion. I have continued to use these glasses all summer and they are in as good of condition as the first day.  The glasses provided good protection with minimal irritation. I have and would continue to recommend these glasses.	2015-08-09

I weat a lot of sandals in the summer time. I bought these a month or two ago but continued using my old pair until yesterda. They seem well made and are very comfortable. I don't know how long they will last but so far they are good. Updated 9/8/2016: I've used these during the entire spring/summer of 2016. They are excellent sandals! The outsole, straps and velcro connectors are all in very good condition. The leather insole is showing signs of wear but I really think it may make it through summer 2017 before it rips. I've tried many other brands of mens sandals in the past and I usually have to buy two pairs each spring/summer. I will defintely buy another pay when needed.	2015-08-09

The European sizes never quite match up to US sizes in my opinion. Ordered a 36/5 big kid and they're still a little big with socks. Not sure if difference exists between big kid or normal size 5, but I noticed huge differences in price between the two.  I'd recommend ordering a 1/2 size down to ensure good fit. My daughter wears a 4 1/2, but I went with the 5 for room. If I had ordered a 4 they would've been perfect for the start of school. Still, no complaints because she can wear these a little later in the semester. Satisfied enough to keep. Bottom sole is just bendable rubber. Upper is like a dyed cloth. Cute with shorts or skirts, but I would only pay $20 or less. It's a VERY simple shoe, FYI. Would buy Cushe shoes again (on sale)!	2015-08-09

This is an economical way to go if you like your canvas purse/backpack that has no or few compartments and everything you put in your purse goes to the bottom and creates the &#34;black hole&#34; effect where you are unable to find anything without emptying your purse out on the floor to find what you want.  How many times has this happened to you?  My granddaughter will not give up her loose canvas backpack but she can't find anything in it.  This purse organizer has been her saving grace.  Her backpack is so organized now.  The bottom of the canvas organizer fits perfect in the bottom of her loose canvas backpack.  An organizer with a hard plastic frame would not fit at all.  This organizer has a nice pattern and colors and a sturdy handle to pull it easily out of the backpack and put it back in.  There are nice elastic pockets located around the organizer and zipper compartments inside. This is a great deal too.  I recommend it.	2015-08-09

SHIPPED VERY FAST and there was no issues with the received product. I have had this style shoe from Asics many times before and despite minimal arch support I knew going in that I didn't purchase these for a comfort standpoint. I like how they look and their ease of putting them on/off is what I make my decision on concerning this style of shoe. The only issue I have is the strings break away from their secure point on the shoe and come undone easily when you tie them. So now I double knot them which is a simple and effective solution.<br /><br />I get compliments all the time on them, and I do recommend to all if you are looking for a great looking shoe for causal wear..	2015-08-09

So I was really surprised that other reviewers recommended ordering up in size. I did what they recommended, and they were right. They definitely run small. I typically wear a 7, and a 7 1/2 fit perfectly. They definitely don't feel as comfortable as my other New Balance shoes, so I'm not sure what happened there.<br /><br />That said, they look GREAT. I love them and wear them as much as possible. I will have to buy inserts because the ones they come with aren't particularly comfortable and provide little support.	2015-08-09

I was looking for a shoe that was lightweight and comfortable enough to wear all day while providing the support my feet need.  This shoe is perfect.  It has just enough support to let me wear them without orthotics while not tiring my feet like many other over-supportive shoes tend to do.  The material is great for warm weather running - I'm running in humid 80+ degree weather and my feet are not overheating.  This is the best running shoe I have purchased.<br /><br />I do have to agree with other reviewers though about the fit of this model vs. other Asics.  I have been wearing Asics for the past several years, and this model definitely is shorter and narrower than other Asics offerings.  I normally wear size 12, but after reading other reviews I ordered a 12.5 EE which fits perfect.  So to echo other reviewers - order a half size larger and one width wider than you usually do.	2015-08-09

I read the reviews and ordered up a size against my better judgement. The size up was wayyyyy too big. My heel was slipping out even with the laces tightened. I do have a pretty narrow foot, so I found them to be true to size. I have exchanged them for my regular size, and I know they'll be perfect.  Update: I just received my new size, and they are exactly what I wanted! I love these so much! I'm normally between a 7 and 7.5. I originally ordered an 8, but they were way too big. I exchanged for a 7.5, and they are perfect!	2015-08-09

Thick and durable plastic, full field-of-vision UV protection, and they look sweet. People look twice for sure, but you know they love it. They feel pretty much like any other sunglasses, except you wear them slightly farther down the nose and sit farther away from the eye sockets (see photo). The darkest band (the center) isn't super thick, so you need to place it right at eye level, but the nose bridge (see photo) helps it fit more comfortably.  Cons: Not a tall field of protection (glasses are narrow) Nose bridge is hard plastic, no cushion Look like an independent individual (is that a con?)  Edit: I ordered the &#34;silver&#34; model which has a band of silver with a black border, not solid silver all the way around.	2015-08-09

I can tighten the laces when I'm wearing stockings and loosen them for heavier socks.  The soft leather lining  is devine.  Somehow the shoes manage to feel soft, flexible and substantial at the same time.  I had looked at them before and felt they were much too expensive (over $200), but when they went on sale (under $100) in my size, I treated myself.  I think Happy Feet is one of the most important things we can do for ourselves to feel good.	2015-08-09

What we like most about them is that they're super easy and fast to get on and off... and they keep his feet cool in the summer. I'll try generic shoes like this every now and again but always come back to Crocs because they last longer -- both the tread and the strap on the heel.<br /><br />Size-wise, these fit exactly as expected... They're exactly the same as what he wears in sneakers, bowling shoes and roller skates.	2015-08-09

The strong, smoothly finished frames, along with the sturdy hinges, provide the ruggedness that holds up to daily use. The New Wayfarer style is great for those with a slightly narrower face, and the new colors are a welcome change. The gradient polarizing lenses of this style are perfect for driving. They allow full protection when looking at the highway, while allowing you to easily see the car's controls and gauges when you look down. The only slight drawback is the interaction of the polarized lenses with the LCD displays in some smartphones and car control screens. The polarizing lenses cause a slight rainbow effect in the display, but the displays are still completely readable.  I certainly wouldn't trade the protection of polarized lenses for this slight annoyance.	2015-08-09

They are extremely comfortable and after wearing a pair you will never want to go back to cheap drug store flip flops again. The footbed material cushions the foot instead of being hard like most flip flops are.<br />The price is higher over the $5 types you will find in most chain or drug stores, but they are so worth it. On Amazon it is possible to find them for a very reasonable price if you search through the different styles/colors.<br />The fit is average. Not as wide as I would like but not so narrow that my food doesn't fit properly.<br />They do last a while. Maybe not if you are going rock climbing, but for the summer season and longer if taken care of.	2015-08-09

These boots are good but not great. The first thing is that there is lots of coverage material with these boots but i have not walked in heavy rain yet. The flaps that connect the toung might experience problems with folding so adjust them when you wear the boots. The boots have damage resistant parts in the front and back of the boot. They are not air circulation friendly. They DO NOT provide good arch support. This needs to be reitterated even if you use custom insoles. They only give a foamy insole and nothing more. There is no boot stabilization either. The boot is walker friendly as the sole curves with your steps. The top hooks might move bot this is not a big issue. These factors make the boot good but not great. I would recommend buying a hard shoe insole such as power step if arch support is needed. Please let me know if this was helpful.	2015-08-09

I was super skeptical ordering these shoes as I've never tried them on in person, but I am so happy I jumped on them! I ordered a half size down based on the other reviews (normally a size 6, ordered 5.5) and they fit great! I know if I would have ordered a 6 they would have been too big. BUT if you plan to wear thicker socks with them you would be fine ordering your normal size I think.  The insoles are awesome!! They have just enough arch support and are very nice to walk on. The soles of the shoes are very grippy which will make nice for running in trails and taking them hiking! Lastly, I love the &#34;no lace&#34; or quick lace system the have! As someone who constantly is tripping on shoe laces and having to re tie them, this is a god send. There is a flap pocket on the tongue of the shoes to tuck the ends into.. Its just awesome.  If I had one complaint it would be purely on looks alone. I don't care for the colors they come in, and the styling is kinda dorky. But I'm going to be wearing these outside they are going to be getting dirty, so who cares? If you're questioning getting these, i say get them!	2015-08-09

Very nice looking and high qualitiy sandals but they won't stay on my feet!!  They would be perfect for someone with really chubby feet. I tried to rectify the situation by sticking some back of heel pads to the underside of strap to take up some space, which helped, but they are still hard to hang onto with my toes. I have regular, normalish 7.5 size feet. Not narrow at all. I got a super deal on them so I will keep them . Good for standing, which  I do a lot of at work.	2015-08-09

I am a former long distance runner and work out in the Gym with my trainer three times per week plus a few days solo. I found that I needed a new shoe with support that could withstand my sometimes aggressive workouts while providing great arch support and comfort. I am most happy with my Salomon and now plan to buy a second pair. The shoe runs a tad larger but it is best to buy at your shoe size because the foot expands while running (runners 101). You will not be disappointed.	2015-08-09

My only small complaint is that they are just a tad bid on the wide side even though I have wide feet. They are so incredibly comfortable and have lasted forever. I bought them a year and a 1/2 ago for a 6 week Asian tour which turned into 7 months because I ended up in the Philippines for 6 months doing humanitarian work after Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) devastated Leyte and parts of Samar. I wore them EVERYDAY for hours on end. I walked in them, hiked in them, ran in them, used them as beach shoes, and swam in them because they were the only shoes I took with me since I wanted to travel lightly. So comfortable and I got lots of compliments on how cute they are. I still wear them many months and miles later and they are still very comfortable but finally the sole part of the bottom have worn out (but not through) and they don't have the traction like they used to.  I'm SUPER bummed that I can't find them any more in my size. They also wash really well in the washing machine.	2015-08-09

I bought a half size smaller than I usually wear, as I do for most flats and canvas shoes especially.  I was trying to replace a pair of Bamboo shoes that looked exactly like these.  I wore them nearly every day with shorts, jeans and just around the house until they literally fell apart.  After looking for most of the summer, I found these.  They are so comfortable, and as several other reviewers noted, I wore them all day the first day without any problems.  As a bonus, unlike the cheaper brand noted above, they have a very soft inner sole with a slight arch support.  I'm so happy that I found these and am planning on purchasing another pair for when I wear these out.	2015-08-09

Luxury with fashion style, upscale with comfortable feel, that is how I like about this handbag. If you want a handbag that can carry most of your daily stuff with real leather material and light weight, then this handbag is perfect for you.  I highly recommend this one because its large space, everything even a small tablet can fit into; files, paper and other stuff are no problem. It also has some layers outside and inside that you can separate different things. Money, card and cellphone are very easy access through outside layer while small things like memory card and flash drive can be stored in order inside. The bag feels upscale with very soft leather, which make people think this is an hundreds dollars handbag. light weight and welcome to long trip runners, great news for your shoulder.  Overall, this is an great handbag combined both practical and style. Paired up with a nice shirt and you are on the roll !	2015-08-09

I love the shoes, the price, the comfort, and the look. But the only problem that I found (at least on my own shoes) is the defect on the right heel, where it is slightly shorter than the left shoe.

I own (or have owned) many pairs of Rocport 10M (and sometimes 10W) shoes.  All styles but mostly walkers dressports etc.  My feet are not oddly shaped.<br />Secondly, the Rockport site censored (oops... sorry... moderated)  my attempt to review this shoe.<br />--<br />I can not comment to the fit and support of the shoe.  I could not get the ball of my foot in past the ankle opening.  We had two full grown adults pulling on the flexible parts of the shoe but could not get them open widely enough to slip into them.<br />I bought these in order to slip on quickly when our new puppy has to go on.  By the time I could get these shoes on, it would be all over but the cleanup.<br />--<br />I hate to give bad reviews because they usually get ignored as being too extremist.  But, what else can you call a slip on shoe that does not slip on.<br />The 'moderated' Rockport reviews talk about 90 year old guys popping these on and heading out.  That swayed my opinion.  Imagine my disappointment.  Even if I could have gotten my foot into the shoe, the tight ankle hole would cut into my ankle (as mentioned by another reviewer on the Rockport site)<br />---<br />Needless to say, these were unusable for me and returned.	2015-08-09

New Balance are very nice shoes and while I can wear them all day I don't. I only walk in them. They are not a bad shoe to do my walking in, I did add a powerstep insert in them to increase the comfort. I am not sure I would pay $130 for another pair since shoes only last about 300-500 miles replacing these every 3 months is a little expensive.	2015-08-09

It is exactly what I was looking for.  All that needs to be said about the quality, workmanship, and materials is, it's a FRYE.  I am not new to FRYE products, and based on my experience with them, I am never fearful nor apprehensive about ordering one of them, and this little bag did not let me down.  It is absolutely gorgeous.  The color is beautiful, the size is perfect, and the style is just lovely.  I loved the color I chose (I chose the burnt red), and the fact the finish is more of a satin finish made it even more perfect.  Upon receipt, I applied a nice coat of the FRYE Leather and Conditioning Cream, and it gave the color that much more wonderful depth.  Apply it according to the directions, and you cannot go wrong.  As an added bonus, the conditioner is marketed as a Weatherproof Dressing, so it is added protection for the leather.  The size could not have been better if the bag had been custom designed for me.  I already had a FRYE handbag for carrying more than I really need a good percentage of the time, and I wanted one for carrying the essentials.  Some would say, and in the reviews have, it is too small, but to the contrary, it is perfect.  Compare it to a person on a diet, where instead of eating what and all they want, they eat smarter, consuming only what they need.  This is a bag on a diet, designed to hold and carry the essentials.  In mine, I have my phone, a sensible size card wallet, extra cards and important ID's in the internal pockets of the bag, keys, lip gloss, and cash, change, and a flat compact in the internal zippered pockets.  What more could I or most others possibly need?  That being said, don't go thinking you are going to put a bulky wallet inside this little bag.  That is not what it was designed for, unless you wan a bag to carry your wallet in.  I have actually replaced my wallet with this little bag, because it's small enough to fit in my larger handbag.  On days where I just want to carry the essentials, it's there and ready to go.  I fell in love with the style the moment I saw it.  The leather is sturdy and soft, the contrast stitching is attractive and tight, and the hardware is tasteful and compliments the design well, altogether, making this little bag a perfect accessory for everyday or with bluejeans.  One reviewer commented about the closure being magnetic and not an actual snap.  Do not let this concern you.  Even though it is magnetic, it will remain securely clasped under normal and moderate use.  I think this will easily become my favorite casual handbag.  Pick your favorite color, take a chance, and enjoy.  I think it is next to impossible to go wrong.	2015-08-09

I wanted something that would hold my glasses, my phone and a small amount of touch-up makeup.  The posted measurents are the size of the box the purse is packed in, not the purse iteself.  The actual purse (not including the ring handle) is 7.5 x 3.75 x 1.75 inches.  The beading is pretty, they are all intact so there will not be a risk of snagging my dress.  However it just is not big enough.  Most likely this will be returned because I will still be looking for an elegant purse to meet my needs.  Amazon, please fix your description.	2015-08-09

I had to order a 7.5, I have Nike 5.0s at 8 and some others in 8.5. The 8s for this shoe were enormous by comparison-not wearable at all, and even the 7.5 has 'room to grow' that any Mom would find satisfactory. I don't think I could fit in a 7, but I wouldn't be surprised if I did either.<br /><br />Also, &#34;off-white&#34; is a pretty misleading. They are tan, even the color code says they're tan/brown (if you ever worked retail you will understand this). They are different enough from the photo that when I opened the box I was pretty surprised/bit unhappy. (-1)<br />If you want to know what this shoe really looks like find the &#34;beige women's&#34; version, and that is what you will get.<br />All that said, they are still comfortable and look great, being tan won't work with as much as I was hoping but I'm still satisfied with the shoe overall.	2015-08-09

But in this case probably not. Man made materials made them stiff. Unable to adjust the straps of course and my foot slipped. After a day of wear the top of my foot had rubbed and been rubbed raw. My heel had the same pain as with other shoes. The shoe itself is attractive but after only a day of wear the embellishments have begun to come loose. I would consider my foot a medium width.	2015-08-09

Mostly because they get lost, sat on, and I prefer the more fun designs like this one. But these are more flimsy than others I've had. The arms are very soft, thin metal and bend out of position almost every time. Only the second time wearing them, the nose bridge pad came off on one side. Thankfully I happened to have an extra in a repair kit. I don't know if it's the brand, or if it's the difference between a $5 and $15 pair, but I wouldn't recommend these for everyday wear.	2015-08-09

Upgraded to these from a pair of Five Ten Freerunner Elements as a general commuting shoe. I haven't been able to get cleats on yet nor am I able to test their hardiness under weather, but I have noticed that they are significantly stiffer than the Freerunners. I can definitely feel this on the bike. Walking is noticeably more rigid; it is nevertheless still very walkable, very grippy, just has a bit of a &#34;clomp clomp&#34; sound to it at first.

I usually wear a size 9, but in this shoe I would highly recommend ordering a half size to a whole size smaller to get the proper fit. Although, my friend ordered her usual size 6 and had no problem. Another funny thing, her shoes were $40 cheaper than my size 9! I know it takes a little bit more leather to make a larger size, but this is a huge discrepancy. The quality of the shoe itself seems very nice and the only other complaint I have is the lack of arch support. At any rate, I'm going to re-order a smaller size and will give my review again on the fit. By the way, the same shoe in a local shoe store is almost twice as expensive. Go Amazon!	2015-08-09

They run slightly narrow but do have adjustable straps at the toe and ankle.  If the manufacturer would add just 1/4&#34; to the width of these for women that would be perfect.  These sandals offer a soft lining on the footbed.  Tevas, Chacos, and other brands have a rubber footbed which drys out the heel of your foot leading to painful cracks, ouch!

I sure love the Ecco brand but...these shoes just looked so different in person than on the pictures. I picked a smaller shoe size but it was still too large.

I'm not a runner, only a walker, and don't even do much of that because of my foot pain. I got a professional fit by an expert. The first thing he asked me to do was to remove my shoes and he watched what my feet did when I walked.  I have high arches and when I walk, my arches tend to fall towards the floor.  After less than an hour of walking my heels tend to hurt and just get worse with more walking. When I've gone to Disneyworld, I have suffered terribly. First day is bad, subsequent days unbearable because of the heel pain. I do not have Planters F. I had physical therapy last year--the issue is my 'gate' so I did a lot of strengthening exercises but despite attempts to find properly fitting shoes, I still had issues.<br /><br />The salesman picked 3 different brands of shoes with excellent arch support. The third pair was this model. I INSTANTLY felt the difference. They were like walking on air.  My feel felt normal for the first time in years.  My feet even moved differently from toe to heel. The salesman said my feel kind of 'slapped' the floor in the other shoes and while walking barefoot.  In these, my feel had a more natural motion. Anyway, believe me, this wasn't just a slick sales job.  The guy knew his stuff. I happily paid the $120 fee for the shoes.  I wore them around power shopping with a friend for the next 3 hours. I was bowled over at the end of the trip when I realized my heels didn't hurt at all.  The next day I went for a 45-minute walk in the new and didn't even notice that I'd been on my feet.  Subsequent walks and shopping trips resulted in the same.<br /><br />The one comment I will make is that I found I needed to wear sox.  Otherwise, my feet tended to slide around a bit.  Ok, most people probably wear sox but I originally grew up in a hot, humid climate and enjoy wearing as little as possible on my feet year 'round.  So in the summer, I now wear very thin ankle sox with these all the time.<br /><br />Ok, to the Amazon purchase:  I loved these shoes so much, that I ordered a second pair (above) in a more muted colors than the original black/lava (fluorescent orange) which was the only option in my size at the running store.  I keep one pair for wearing outside the house and one for inside (to keep my carpets clean).  My physical therapist had recommended I wear well-fitting athletic shoes all the time (except to bed) so that my foot got the support it needed.  My feet are now VERY happy both indoors and out.  I cannot wait for another trip to Disney to see how well the perform there.  Both pairs are the exact same model, just different colors.<br /><br />In closing, you really need to try shoes on to get the perfect fit--that's a no brainer.  Everyone's feet are different.  So if you are considering these, I'd at least try them on at a store first, then order on Amazon if it makes sense. I saved $20 by purchasing the 2nd pair on Amazon.  However, nothing replaces knowing you got a good fit if you have issues with your feet.r, I now wear very thin ankle sox with these all the time.<br /><br />Ok, to the Amazon purchase:  I loved these shoes so much, that I ordered a second pair (above) in a more muted colors than the original black/lava (fluorescent orange) which was the only option in my size at the running store.

I chose the baby pink and I couldn't be happier with the color. This picture shows it to be a bit brighter than they actually are, so baby pink is an accurate description of the color. I'm a 7.5 U.S. And bought size 8, but I wish I'd gone with the 7. They fit, but I'm in the tightest hole for the strap and once my feet naturally push forward in the shoe, there is space behind my heel. I was cautious with this purchase but next time I buy pleasers, (and there will be a next time) I'll size down, and I recommend doing that.	2015-08-09

I purchased them for my nephew who absolutely lost it when I gave them to him!! On top of having a precious, vibrant design on each boot, this set features a pull tie closure on the top that aids in keeping water out. They fit true to size and have handles on each side of the boots that help little hands to pull them up. One thing I also noticed is that the soles of these are much more padded and comfortable feeling than other rain boots that I've bought for my kids. Hooray for comfy puddle stomping!!!

These were my first pair of tow shoes and Filas.  Make sure you go to the Fila website and print off the foot sizing pages.  I purchased a mens pair because of the color option and the Fila sizes do not run the way you would think.  That being said, the size fit true to my measurement and the graph translation of sizes between men and womens shoe size.  I used these shoes for walking and swimming in the ocean.  I found the shoes to be very comfortable.  While in the shoes it kept feeling like the shoes were loose but when I checked the velcro the shows were still secured.  I think it was just the water flowing inside the shoes.  The drain holes in the sole and the mesh between the toes allowed the water to drain well.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I plan to continue to use these shoes while outdoors in creeks and during any water activity.	2015-08-09

They kept my feet cool in the summer and (much to my surprise) warm in the winter (with the right socks). I think my feet stayed warm in very cold temperatures (sub-zero) because they allowed my feet to breath and stay dry. As a result, my socks didn't lose their insulating power.	2015-08-09

I read another buyer's review that mentioned the larger fitting sizes of these shoes.  So I took his advice and went down a half a size from the size I normally wear, and the shoe fits perfectly.  There's no arch support, but there's not supposed to be any support of any kind--they're barefoot shoes.  I feel very much connected to the ground and can even feel small pebbles beneath my feet when I walk over them.  Wearing these shoes is more like wearing no shoes than I imagined, which is why I love them.  I would have purchased the Vibram shoes with the individual toes, but I'm kind of too cheap to want to buy all new socks to go with them.  Anyway, according to the other informed buyer's review, this shoe is the closest thing to those shoes with toes.  In my experience with these shoes, I can say he's probably correct.  The one drawback is that they look kind of dumb with their wide toe area.	2015-08-09

I love the purse and couldn't return it anyway, so I decided to try Meltonian, with the hope that I could actually carry this purse around without it looking ugly and spotted. I sprayed 2 applications on the purse. I first noticed that it did not darken the leather at all (my purse is a lighter brown, cognac color). I decided to test it by putting some water on it, and to my surprise the water beaded up and I was able to wipe it away with no water stain. I have since dripped coffee on it and the same thing happened - I was able to wipe it away with no stain left on the leather. I just bought another can because I don't want to be without it. I plan to continue applying this to my purse periodically to keep the leather protected.	2015-08-09

Great buy for quality and price.  However the wrong color sandal came in the mail for me... I got white instead of the light pink... I sent the sandal back for an exchange and filled out the form explaining what color I had actually wanted and ordered and they sent me the white sandals again :( I just kept the white. Overall a great product!! Would reccomend for others.	2015-08-09

They leave plenty of exposed Velcro hooks to snag on everything and scratch exposed skin, and the straps themselves are heat-cut and scratchy at the edges with melted material. There is simply no way to cross your legs while wearing shorts without scratching yourself with the hooks or strap ends.<br /><br />Typically I wear sandals all summer with shorts, and these sandals are so scratchy they are nothing short of horrid. I can't cross my legs at the knee, cross my ankles, or sit cross legged without immediately becoming uncomfortable.<br /><br />I give them two stars because they are in fact sandals, and they'll probably last for decades because I won't wear them. I feel guilty about donating them, but that's where they're going to end up.<br /><br />Why did I buy them in the first place? I read a review that ranked them #1. I now suspect shenanigans. Teva: never, ever again.	2015-08-09

They were a little tight so I returned them to the brick and mortar store and had them reordered in the next size up.<br />These are extremely comfortable shoes that can transition from casual to business casual and are not only comfortable but very well made as well. While you can buy cheap imitations, I can attest that is probably not the way to go if you have foot issues. I tried an imitation and returned them immediately after sitting in them in the house for an hour. I was in serious pain without even walking in them.<br />I normally buy Birkenstock, Vionic, Clarks and Arcopedico because I need extra support. These Bob's are probably the only moderately priced brand that actually work for me. I spent a couple of days at Greenfield Village doing a lot of walking and I felt fine after each day.<br />I'd be inclined to give this particular shoe 5* if not for the sizing issue that I had. I am glad that I ordered up because I would have missed out on a good shoe that is also cute and comfy.	2015-08-09

I have tried many different shoes over the years trying to find one that would not tear up with my rough use in so little time and one that would also give me the support I need. My feet are relatively flat and they roll inwards as I step. I am considered an over pronator and these shoes help to correct that problem. The arch is fairly high but also sturdy so it keeps my foot in place all day long. I have attempted to find other shoes to help me with this problem in the last year or so because Nike no longer makes these so they are much harder to find in the correct size or for a decent price range. None of the other shoes were able to meet my high needs. I am hoping to find some more of these in the very near future! They are great shoes for cross training and I would even wear them running.	2015-08-09

What more could I ask for?	I have always been a big fan of hobo style tote bags, and this is no exception. I absolutely LOVE this bag, it is ridiculously cute and is perfect for pairing with a nice pair of cutoff jean shorts and a fun flowy top. It's so easy to just sling it over my shoulder, toss on a pair of oversized sunglasses and head on out for the day.<br /><br />The black and white paisley print is really trendy, and I love that it has a bright pop of color right in the center. The metal studs that outline the leather pocket are a nice touch as well. I have been using it as more of a &#34;toss all' kind of bag since the main inner pocket is very large. There is also a smaller pocket for a cellphone and one for money/ID/credit cards, but for the most part the bag is one big pocket.<br /><br />I have found that it is plenty large enough to carry my 15&#34;  laptop along with me as well a few other things at the same time. I can say that it wipes clean easily, as I did spill something on it right after I got it, but I was able to clean it just by wiping with a wet rag and allowing it to air dry. I do not think I would machine wash this bag, just to be on the safe side I would recommend hand washing and air drying if it gets dirty.

These ADIDAS sandals are very comfortable.  They look nice too (white and black).<br />But on the heel there is a logo that peeled up within 2 days of wearing them (roughly 4 hours on my feet).  Be nice if the logo was applied differently so that it didn't come off the sandal.  I'm not wearing them for a fashion statement, as I don't wear sandals in public, so it doesn't bother me as much as it might someone else.

The pumps by RIverberry are perfect to wear with my vintage clothes. The heel height  (2 1/2 inches) is really cute with the 50's circle skirts.  The color I selected, which was mint patent, is the perfect color too.  But they also are really cute with modern clothes too. I wore them today a pair of capri jeans and a loose bohemian type shirt. They are rather comfortable, I wore them this afternoon and walked several blocks. My feet did not hurt at all.  The shoe is made from man made material.  I believe the top is glued on as I can find no stitching.  The part of the shoe where the toes fits in sits a bit further back on my feet then most heels, but I am happy with this as I find it more comfortable. I am very happy with this pair of kitten heels, I will wear them often.<br />I purchased this pair of shoes at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review.  I based my review on my opinion and my experience with wearing the heels today.	2015-08-09

These water shoes were used both at the beach and the pool.  The soles did NOT come out and the shoes dried well when left in the sun.  The only down side was they were a bit tough to get on.  I figured out a wiggle on technique that worked well.  I would wiggle the shoe on and then pull the heel end up over the back of the foot.	2015-08-09

Beautiful shoe, love LR though do think the price is high in this case for what you get.  It runs a little small (short) I bought an 8.5 based on another review I'm usually an 8, and the are just the right length, but I prob could have got away with a 9 also, it's lace up the whole way down so I'd buy for the length then you can just tighten as needed.  The lace up is like a shoe lace and I expected leather thonging, I'm yet to wear them out but they feel super comfy and a practical heel height.  They took about 10 mins to get into, hoping won't be as long next time new they are adjusted but it's a bit fidley and tangely...but they are super cute and match heaps in my wardrobe so I expect I'll be keeping them!	2015-08-09

I actually use it as a work shoe on a local municipality doing blacktop work and I figured they'd be a good summer shoe for that purpose. Vey comfortable and easily worn all day with total comfort. Durability for my use will be determined but as of right now couldn't be happier. One caveat though: As people, have said, they do run a touch snug. I usually am a 12 and they fir ok, but a 13 would have been perfect in lieu of the availability of a 12.5.<br /><br />Great shoe, highly recommended.

I purchased these shoes as water shoes for a recent trip to the Caribbean. We were planning a day trip to hike some waterfalls, and I wanted a shoe that was comfortable, would stay on, grip well and look decent enough for walking around. I was REALLY impressed with these shoes! Not only did the shoes grip the wet rocks on the hike up the waterfalls, but they stayed on during multiple jumps off the rock and into the water! Because I was packing light, I also wore these on the plane ride, and they were super comfortable. Even though I never thought I would own a pair of crocs, I really love these shoes and have worn them every time I need a reliable, comfortable lightweight shoe.	2015-08-09

I'm glad that I purchased these.  I tried the Nike Vapor X and find these fit me better since I prefer a slightly wider shoe.  The touch on the ball is great with these diadoras.  I don't think that the ventillation system on these makes any noticeable difference, but I don't feel that they detract from the shoe either.  The shoe is quite flexible and so I get a good feel for the ball.  I usually get Kangaroo leather shoes and was a bit apprehensive about trying a synthetic material, but I am glad that I did.  I'm going to buy another pair to have as a backup since I like them so much. Finally, I prefer the color scheme of these diadora dd-na version 2 shoes compared to the original diadora dd-na version 1 shoes.  They look much better in real life, most of the online pictures I have seen make them look a bit large and cumbersome, but in reality they are quite sleek.  Definitely tops in my books, especially if you want a light shoe that fits slightly wider feet.	2015-08-09

They work well for the walks up/down hill and the ~16 miles round bike trip, not as cumbersome as my hiking boots especially on the bike. So far so good. I guess we'll see how they hold up through the next growing season (2016). I bought locally the size 16 (which is what I nominally would wear) and that's how they fit. I suppose they could be a little bit wider but they're still new-ish, so maybe they'll stretch out.<br /><br />Haven't tried them for &#34;casual-sneaker&#34; use yet but might kick around the mall in them for a couple hours one of these days, or go downtown or something. Who knows. They are pretty cool with jeans, if that's important to you.//<br /><br />EDIT ADD (2015 September 06):<br />For esses and giggles I recently decided to work a couple 8-hour shifts with these boots. I work full-time as a stocker and assistant grocery manager in an area warehouse store, so I'm on my feet for about 85-90% of the day. I would like to say they saved my bad back, but that'd be a pretty severe exaggeration so I won't, even though I just did. The rubber cleats do seem to give them a bit of extra cushion on the hard concrete floors upon which I toil to earn my just-above-minimum wage, and my lower back seemed to ache considerably less at the end of shifts than if I had been wearing my standard Wolverines. (This is what you get for being 6 1/2 feet tall and racing bikes for enough years without a back brace/kidney belt. Lesson learnt; yes, you are young, invincible and omnipotent NOW but it catches up with you LATER in your 30s.) Your results may vary; my feet are kind of weird and what is comfortable for me may or may not be for the next guy. But you may find they're good for that too. Do be cautious wearing them on wet tile/concrete floors, especially at first, as the soles have very little traction on smooth wet surfaces until the treads have broken in a little bit.<br /><br />At the very least your coworkers will be complementing you on your killer turfs, which counts for something.treads have broken in a little bit.

I purchased these specifically for Zumba and though they hold up well in class (and tread is perfect for the dance moves!) as soon as I stop moving I can't wait to get them untied.

Still looking for the perfect Zumba shoe.	2015-08-09

These were intended to be my &#34;business professional&#34; heels for interviews, meetings, and presentations, but after 2 hours in these heels I just couldn't. The fit is fine - I don't get blisters anywhere - but the sole of the shoe at the balls of my feet is just so thin and hard, I feel like my feet are on the hardwood floor. If you won't need to wear these for more than an hour or two though, go for it! The style is beautiful.<br />Shortly after I bought these though, I found a plain non-patented pair of conservative black EasySpirit kitten heels that were so padded and so comfortable!

My first pair was of the model 10 and I had a lot of success with that shoe. I find the 11 to be very similar to the tens but just a little more comfortable. I like the 8 millimeter heel to toe drop, but most importantly the large toe box and soft coushioning are great for me because I have a neuroma that causes pain and numbness in some of my toes.  I have also owned the Saucony Ride, which is a good shoe,  but it lacks the large toe box and the cushioning is slightly less comfortable. If you're looking for a great shoe with a neutral cushion I highly recommend the Saucony Triumph.	2015-08-09

Amazon redeemed themselves and are shipping me new boots but I still question Timberlands quality.	2015-08-09

They have the desired Rayban look for a fraction of the price, which is what I'm sure many people are after when purchasing these. I was not expecting anything extraordinary when purchasing these, but I expected that they would look like what they do in the picture. The presence of the &#34;Styyle?&#34; icon on the lense makes them undersirable because the picture does not show any kind of icon. Also, I found that the lenses were an awkward shape. Overall, you get what you pay for, so don't expect to be wooed with this purchase.	2015-08-09

I knew this shoe  had animal prints and was water repellent before I bought it because I researched it on the manufacturers website. In fact I bought it from Nike.com.  So my only surprise was that it was a bit warmer than say a fly knit or other non-water repellent shoe. Other than that, I've been wearing the shoe for running a few miles weekly, exercising, day-to-day wear, and to work when I have long days - rotating between this show and others- for the past year or so. I keep all my running shoe soles fresh by applying a thin layer of shoe goo to where it tends to wear out. This extends the life of the sole dramatically. Now, I’m back in the market for a new running shoe and let me tell you I wear this you on one  foot and put the brand-new shoe on the other foot and when it comes to specifically the feel in the foot, that marshmallow feel that walk in the clouds feel, no one beats it. I'm just stating facts.  I have compared the Nike air max 2015, the Nike Pegasus 32, to the asics quantum 360s, to the Nimbus 17, to the Kayano 21’s, and ASIC cumulus, and a nice pair of Brooks, reeboks, and Armours. Closest all around comfy fit was Nimbus 17. Maybe you'd want stiffer shoe for longer more hardcore running but for my use, I really like these shoes. Only complaint is why are the shoe laces so dang short?	2015-08-09

I never expect any shoe to have good arch support, so I always try several of my insoles to see which works best. I always know Merrells will fit me perfectly! These are slightly LESS shoe than I was expecting. The outer soles are not as thick, so not quite the protection from small stones, which I can feel through the soles. I would not expect these outersoles to hold up well on sidewalks or pavement. They seem perfect on the trail. That said, I still like them, a lot! I am switching from my traditional hiking boots to lighter trail &#34;shoes&#34; as part of a switch to &#34;ultralight&#34; backpacking. My lighter loads mean I can get away with lighter shoes. My ankles are, gratefully, still strong, and I am sure-footed, so switching from boots to trail shoes has been easy for me.  I give the Mix Master Move Glide 2 a 5-star rating.	2015-08-09

I can wear these all day they are pretty comfortable.  I will say that if you plan on wearing these with no socks like I do, then do NOT get them wet and try to wear them all day.  I went out and there was water around and they stayed wet for most of the day, it kind of shot the inner shoe liner, so I ripped them out and replaced them with some cheap $4.00 Dr. Scholl's ones and they are just fine.  If you are going to be around water, just beware the glue on the inside isn't the best.  Other than that, I love these shoes, I just ordered another pair but in a different design.	2015-08-09

I liked the design and the leather.  I normally wear a 9 1/2 or a 9 in some brands. These 9 1/2s were too small and narrow even with bare feet.

Way comfortable right out of the box. I was worried about a break in period but that was definitely not the case at all for the whole five hours my feet felt fine. No discomfort, no rubbing, no soreness, good ankle support. I can honestly say I am blown away with how affordable these boots are and how amazing they are. Once these get worn out I WILL buy again!

Love the look of these boots but they aren't that comfortable to walk around in. My pinky and big toe start to hurt after 30 min due to the tightness of the fit and the fact that the front of the boot uses a hard leather. The front of the boot is also sort of narrow, so I had to bring it in to a shoe service to get it stretched out and widened. For the price, the material is a decent quality though. These boots are so cute but I wish they fit better!	2015-08-09

I ordered a 7W.  This shoe fit like it was about a 6.5 narrow or a 6 regular.  When I started shopping for walking shoes, I decided I wanted an updated, fashionable color.  New Balance needs to stick with the plain colored shoes that they make so well.  I felt like these were a cheap, China made pair that are sold solely to satisfy the niche customers who want an updated look.  NB needs to stick with what they do best.	2015-08-09

The box was marked with the right size, but one shoe was my size and the other was a size smaller!  I tried to return them, and Amazon would not take them back for a full refund even though I had never worn them except to try them on, and the wrong product was shipped to me.  Amazon let me return them for a partial refund, barely worth my trouble.  I was very irritated.  Word to the wise -- try on or try out the products you order right away!	2015-08-09

Not quite the fit I expected from Clarks.  I think I am just about a perfect 9C but anticipated that Clarks make a more comfortable fit so ordered a 9M because I could adjust the buckles.

US	13053275	R2DKBR8N0LV2IV	B00KO3RMJK	504794368	Kaylena Water Resistant Canvas Shoulder Bag	Shoes	3	4	4	N	Y	I love this purse, but...	I love the looks of this bag and the size of it. The size is wonderful. Yesterday I went to a rally and I was able to fit in a water bottle, a book, a baggie full of snacks, my wallet and cosmetic case, a scarf in case it got chilly on the evening, and all of the smaller items that tend to end up in purses. There are many compartments to help organize everything, which I love. The reason this bag only got 3 stars instead of the 5 stars it deserves, is because of the straps. I got a backpack purse because I need to use it as a backpack. My shoulders start to ache when I use a regular strap. I get the convenience of having both, as I like to use a strap now and again for a short duration, such as when I am going from my car to the house.  The way it is set up now is that the strap is one long length and can be pulled up through the the two metal rings on each side to create one long strap. You pull it back down when you want the back pack option. This is where the issue is for me. When I put one of the straps on my shoulder, the entire length is pulled to that side. Then I have to struggle to get some of that length to the other side. During this process the strap becomes tangled and I have to struggle to untangle it and then tug and pull so that I have an equal length on both sides. It's aggravating to the point where if I am in a hurry, I won't want to use this purse.There needs to be something to lock each strap in one in place, such as snaps or velcro, or something, or to unlock it when you just want to use a single strap. As it is, I am going to have to jerry-rig something so I can continue to use it.	2015-08-09

I was really surprised how nice they are, especially the frames. It's like those poly-carbonate plastic frames from expensive brands that charge ten times as much.  They appear just like the pictures with the exact color shade and frame shape. The finish was very smooth and didn't have any jagged fragments that I've seen on other cheap sunglasses that I've purchased.  I have to confess, I'm a sucker for green sunglasses with faded lenses, it's my Achilles heel, my Kate Upton, my favorite Avengers movie, any Veronica Mars tv episode, etc.  The gradient lenses are plastic and feature a brownish green fade and the tint view is different compared from my other green sunglasses. Looking through them is a pleasant light brown tint and when daytime driving I was surprised seeing yellowish hues coming from oncoming cars with white LED driving headlights on.<br /><br />Sunglasses did come from China, but didn't come with a carry case or polyester bag and lenses are not polarized.  Price was right and I probably would have paid three times, maybe four times the $5 I got for these sunglasses, they were that nice.	2015-08-09

Though these do not have a dedicated arch support, these are so comfortable. I broke my ankle a few years ago so arch support is very important to me and I can wear these all day and be completely fine. I only wear Reef's-nothing else. My mom loved these flip flops so much [because of the color] I bought her a pair but she fell even more in love with them because they are extremely comfortable. She wears them all day. She used to wear flip flops from Old Navy but after a few hours she would have pain in her feet. Not any more! Since I bought her Reefs, it's the only pair of flip flops she wears. I have to get her more! I have been a huge Reef supporter for over ten years and recommend them to everyone!	2015-08-09

I purchased these slip on sketchers sneakers as I have for years. They are my absolute favorite sneakers to wear and I must have 25 pairs of sketchers because they're so comfortable and lite  and I guess that's why they must call them D'Lites. I really wanted the white slip on sketchers but I didn't find them in my size. And so instead I got these really cool charcoal gray and pink slip ons instead and like I said, I absolutely love them.  It seems like there's no break in time which is such a big plus when you're buying new shoes, sure hope they keep on coming out with different colors and staying with the same comfortable insole.  I would recommend these shoes to anyone who wanted a nice light comfortable barely wearing anything kind of feel on their feet and definitely purchase them through Amazon because they made it so easy to make this purchase.	2015-08-09

After reading some of the reviews on here, I decided to go half a size down on the sizing. I bought a 6 instead of a 6.5. Really, I could have gone a while size down. There is plenty of length in them. I have wide feet, so I was worried that going down a while size should make it too narrow for me, so I stuck with the 6. They don't feel too big, I just have some room at the top of the sandal.<br /><br />These are my first pair of Tevas and they are really comfy. I wanted a casual sandal with some support that I could wear this summer, and these are perfect for that. There is plenty of room up top for my wide feet, they have more support that the flat sandals I was previously wearing, and they seem like they will last for a long time.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I found that the ankle strap could be a little bigger, but it's not uncomfortable for me. It's not rubbing my ankles the wrong way, or cutting into them. It just feels snug. Overall, I'm very pleased with these sandals.<br /><br />Also, I bought these in &#34;chocolate&#34; and they are a dark purple. Almost like a wine stain purple.	2015-08-09

It's rare to find big shoes in Asia where she is right now so I got her the size 42 Dansko Chrissy black suede. I know she's going to love this pair because I myself have fallen in love with how comfortable these shoes feel on my feet. I am going to buy a pair for myself at my size. As you can see on the third attached photo that's my left foot, and I wear a size US 8.5W that's why this shoe looks loose but I'm amazed because the shoe doesn't look big at all. It flatters anyone's feet and make them look smaller.	2015-08-09

I have been wearing these boots for about 9 months now.  I work at a large cabinet company  5 -  6 days a week and about 50 -  60 hours a week.  These boots are as tough as they come.  I went through 2 pairs of wolverines in 6 months switching between the 2 pairs a few times a week.  After 9 months of abuse these timberlands are still going strong but there says are numbered.  Now I don't expect boots to last this Kong in my case but the outside of these are like  new.  I cleaned them last week and you wouldn't think they were older than a month old.<br /><br />  The bad?  Besides the soles which go on every pair of boots fairly quickly,  I would say every 3 months.  The only bad thing I can tell you about these is the last tabs on the top for the laces broke off.  One about a month ago and the other a week later only on one boot.  The other one is still good.  I drilled a hole right where the tab was and if you looked at it you would think they came like that it blends in so well.  The only other con is the back of the inside ( heel)  has totally Fallin apart over the last month.  It's just the leather now but still decently comfortable.<br /><br />With average use ( 40 hours a week)  I'd say these could go up to 2 years.  In my case of walking 6 -  12 miles a day and then working 8 -  12 hours a day 6 days a week.  I would find it extremely hard to believe you could find a better pair of boots than the pro series timberland line.  I have tried other companies and you do get what you pay for.  I'll be buying pro series the rest of my life.	2015-08-09

One thing I have noticed that I don't care for on these shoes is the the tongues shift/slide over and down towards the outsides of the shoes on both sides after you've worn them for an hour or so. -To the point that the little sewn on piece or band of material sewn onto the top-middle of the tongues about half way up the tongues that the shoelaces are supposed to pass through to keep them in place ends up butting to the outside edges of the part of the shoes that the shoelace eyes are in. Hope this makes sense. -Basically the tongues shift kind of far to the outsides of the shoes -way more than any other shoe of this type I've ever owned, and I've bought a lot of them. So far the tongue problem doesn't seem to cause any discomfort, it just looks a little funny if you take the time to look down there. I don't think anyone that wasn't wearing the shoes would even notice. Comfort and solid construction and price are all very good.	2015-08-09

Obviously they are not for all day wear but I am 44 years old and have not wore high heels in years and needed something for my sons wedding. He is tall and I am 5'1+. I also would say I have a slightly wide foot. I do not buy wide shoes but have always had trouble wearing a narrow toes shoe because my feet (at the toe area) are to wide. These almost felt stretchy(the straps) I was totally amazed at how comfortable they were for this style. I would recommend them and as far as looks they are gorgeous. Everyone I spoke to at my sons wedding made a comment about how nice my shoes were.	2015-08-09

These are just so much better than what you would expect for the price.  They don't look or feel like cheap sunglasses.  I adore them!

Love the color and they work great for running which is why I got them too. Only thing is, I wanted them to fit, so to be safe I got 1/2 size larger than I normally wear. They ended up being 1/2 size larger (my fault), but wear them with thicker socks and it's all good. So if you purchase these, they fit true to size.	2015-08-09

Break in took about two weeks of wearing them around the house for a few hours each day.<br />I must use insoles for arch support cause my arches are so high.

These Lowa boots are the first I've owned for my job that make my feet feel hot.  They are consistent in their hot feeling too, no matter the outside temperature, my feet feel the same degree of hot.<br />I really enjoy the comfort of these boots, I feel as though I could walk for days and days without foot fatigue, I just wish they didn't feel so hot.	2015-08-09

The sole begins to detach from the shoe, making them more water absorbent than a towel. Cant say Id recommend these for the price youre paying.   Good shoes, they do as needed. Comfortable and keep your feet dry, but the durability is questionable. After using them for roughly 7 months, the outer sole of the shoe began to disconnect, allowing water to openly flow into the shoe from the bottom, defeating the purpose of this shoe. They work wonders for the time they last, but I cant say Im happy with their lifespan.	2015-08-09

I am 42 with a back injury and I can wear these all day and not get sore feet. I am a solid size 8, but these are a little tighter in the toe, so I got these a half-size bigger. Perfect fit. They have memory foam so they are soooo comfy! My 75-yr old mom thought they were so cute, she bought a pair of each and will wear them this Fall and Winter. What I love about them is you can wear them with skinny jeans and they flatter the calve area. They fit nicely for bigger calves because they are wider at the top. Great quality too.

Perfect for my twins ! they both loved them and they can wear them with almost anything. A nice rubber sole for grip and a nice cushion comfort in the sandal. I order these due to the Velcro closures on the ankle and the toes. I have one girl with a wider foot, but not wide enough to order wide sizes. This fit the bill , can adjust width with the Velcro and around ankles. Cute fashion with the silver color ( can wear with almost anything ) and the flower is cute also.<br />Very happy with all aspects of these sandals ,I would  highly recommend.	2015-08-09

I bought this shoe for an upcoming trip to Europe - I always buy Clarks for any trips where I will be doing a lot of walking, and they've rarely disappointed.  I was excited when I took these out of the box and when I put them on. However, I ordered my normal size due to all of the reviews, and I really should have ordered a half size bigger (my big toe was ever so slightly touching the front of the shoe when I walked). I wore them around inside for about an hour, to decide if I wanted to reorder in a larger size. Alas, I began to get some irritation on my heel at the top of the shoe (the Achilles area). When I took them off to see what was rubbing, I saw the problem immediately - there is a beautiful stitching detail that runs up the center of the heel of the shoe, but it comes up over the edge of the shoe just slightly, and that is what was irritating me. I know if I tried to wear these for a long period while walking, there would be problems. So these are going back, not to be reordered. I'm still in love with the Clarks brand though, and I will try another Clarks shoe instead!	2015-08-09

They are noticeably lighter, and the thinner &#34;New Wayfarer&#34; line is really a great improvement on the old style.  The Amazon price is 60-70 dollars less than Lenscrafters or retail shops.  Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />***Why I like these:  I'm a hobby cyclist, and pretty routinely take 100-130 mile bike rides, and at the end of 10 hours on a bike, it still feels like I'm not even wearing them.  To contrast, my temple tire from the Warby Parker glasses I wear to the office during the week.  I guess it's an odd comparison - but if you can relate, you know the value of an ultra-light pair of glasses.<br /><br />(liked them so much, I bought a new pair this year after losing the same exact pair last year)	2015-08-09

I didn't buy these sexy pumps off amazon (got them directly from 6pm.com), but wanted to review them because pumps like this deserve my praise lol. I wore them for the first time last night with a pair of super skinny designer jeans and a ribbed tank and that's all I needed! The vibrant blue suede and ultra feminine d'orsay style adds so much to a simple outfit and you can't help but feel confident and fabulous.<br />I like my heels to fit snug on my feet and I despise awkward shoe gaps, so I got a 7 1/2. These are true to size since I am between a 7 1/2 and an 8, but if you want a more comfortable fit and are between sizes, I would get the larger.A lso, these are not for wide feet at all, but perfect for slender, average or narrower feet. Steve Madden is pretty consistent with sizes, so if  you're familiar with his shoes and fit,  you know what to do! I love these pumps!	2015-08-09

This shoe does tend to run a bit small; about a size to a size and half too small. If you like a snug fit, buy one size larger. (looser fit buy 1.5 sizes larger) This shoe's ride is excellent. It has a very natural ride, thanks to the zero drop and wide toe box (which I love). I am a collegiate runner in track and cross country and use this shoe as my normal everyday trainer. This light uptempo shoe is also great for races. Will be buying again.	2015-08-09

Other reviewers are right - these boots are very snug.  I've never needed wide-width shoes, but these boots squished the sides of my feet, and I was very concerned that I wouldn't be able to wear them.<br /><br />I would have given 2 stars, but after I tried the boots on I bought a shoe stretcher and stretched the boots - it has helped quite a bit. I was able to wear them all day at work without the shoe squishing my feet. I did discover after a day of wearing that the &#34;tongue&#34; of the show is very stiff and dug into my foot a bit, so I'll be working on breaking that in as well.<br /><br />The boot looks great, and after stretching it is wearable, but it would be great if the boot fit right out of the box. I hope eventually the designer/manufacturer adjusts the design so the boot isn't so incredibly narrow.	2015-08-09

I love Scott Flip Flops and have worn them for decades now. They grip well enough on a slippery surface and there is a some arch support. Yes, the sole might eventually wear through/separate or the toe strap might pull out. Scott might replace the pair if it meets their criteria of wear and use. I get 10 years out of a pair so I never tried to get a replacement. You are more likely to lose the slippers than wear them out.

These shoe are a little expensive for casual shoes (more on that in a few lines), but worth every penny! They are amazingly comfortable and the level of craftsmanship is very high.<br /><br />Two important notes.<br /><br />First; these shoes are very casual! Even more than the picture suggests. There really isn't a way to dress them 'up.' They work perfectly for me (at work we have a very loosely defined 'business casual' dress code), but in a more stringent setting would appear out of place. The venting system, while practical, is a big part of this. It's too conspicuous for business attire.<br /><br />Second, as others have said, the sizes run big. I would order a full size down. I'm a solid 12.5 normally, but ordered an 11.5 in this shoe. It fits like a glove, and felt almost pre-broken in out of the box. For me it was a perfect fit!	2015-08-09

If you have wide feet which Patagonia usually does not cater to, these are the perfect shoes for you.  This is my 3rd pair purchased in less than two months!  I had to stock up after knowing how perfect they are for my wide, flat feet!!  They are extremely comfortable and make my foot look narrow or more normal.  Very happy with these!  Hope Patagonia will start making more shoes for people with wide feet.  Patagonia has always been a favorite of mine for gear!  5 Stars for these for a person with flat and wide feet!  For me, these fit true to size.  I wear an 8 wide or have to wear an 8.5 to get extra width in shoes.	2015-08-09

The opening of the boot is a little larger than I was expecting them to be which cause a little gap between my leg and the boot so I was surprised at that. The leather is so soft. I have not worn them yet so I can't say how they feel all day for me I order an 8 1/2 and they were a little large so I will have to wear them with a sock.

This type of shoe (Florsheim) is true fit. Meaning, if you are a size 10 get a size 10 they are true to size. I cannot say enough good things about this particular shoe. I love, love, love, love, these shoes. They go with everything and they are absolutely the most comfortable pair of shoes I have. What makes them stand out is the Cuban heel.

These are super cute and are definitely the perfect summer and spring shoes. I love wedges because it gives you a little bit more comfort and ease of walking.<br /><br />I love wearing heels, but they are not comfortable and they always make my feet hurt for like a week. I love platforms because the heels are a little bit thicker, so I'm definitely more comfortable wearing those whenever I'm going out. But! I love wedges for everyday wear.<br /><br />I think that having a pair of super cute wedges with this kind of coloring, with its bright and happy yellow is perfect for the springtime. They can match any kind of dress, or even shorts with a cute matching top. Basically I would never have anything bad to say about wages. And these ones are really cute looking.	2015-08-09

I just bought Reebok Fitframes, and they're no match for the Jetfuses. The Fitframes are cheaper, and they don't protect the balls of the feet as the Fuses do.

I can't wait for it to get colder so I can wear these more often. A problem that a lot of shoes have in this style is not staying on your feet very well or moving around a lot on your foot. This pair stays on perfectly! The dark grey looks very cool & different in person.	2015-08-09

My feet are difficult to fit shoes to comfortably.  I have developed hammer toes on one foot  and I also often have swelling due to formerly broken bones and torn ligaments that needed to be surgically repaired as well as life-long flat feet so I need superior arch support with DEEP, WIDE shoes.  I ordered wide which are not as wide (or deep) as in Drew or other orthotic shoes of the same size but they are okay and since they are leather will mold to fit in time.	2015-08-09

I am a big fan of Cacoon's amber--green mirrored polarized lenses. They really do help to enhance detail, and I much prefer them over gray lenses. And while the MX shape is very sleek, modern and sexy, it lets in too much light with my wide Ray Ban eyeglass frames, and allows too much reflection off of the face. I have instead gone with Cacoon's Aviator model, which is much more &#34;sealed in&#34;  and has much less reflection onto  the back of the lenses from my skin. However the Aviator model is much larger and goggle-like and not nearly as sleek as the MX style. I guess I chose function over style....	2015-08-09

This is my fourth pair so I knew what size to purchase.

Unfortunately, I developed planar fasciatis shortly after buying them.  The injury was not due to these shoes but the accumulated wear & tear on my arches through previous shoes.  This is a minimalist shoe so theres a &#34;minimal&#34; amount of support to promote a more natural stride while running/walking.  The reason for me saying &#34;4.5&#34; stars is I have wide feet and these are just a tiny bit too narrow...other than that they are perfect.  Once i'm recovered from my injury i will be wearing these as much as possible.	2015-08-09

However, perhaps with use I can break them in. Great for summer wear.	2015-08-09

Only complaint is that the strap should have a little bit of adjustability to it in case of skinny heels (like my daughter's).

If you don't need arch supports, these may be wonderful for you.  They have a strange jelly type insole that makes your feet very hot and sweaty if you don't wear socks.  The material (supposedly leather) in the &#34;straps&#34; on the side of the toes is very thin and I do not doubt they will tear eventually, however the part that covers the end top of the toe and the top of the foot are reinforced.  I kept the shoe, because I needed a pair that I could slip my foot into at the time I purchased them.  I wear them in the house, with socks and they are ok if I change them out for shoes with an arch support after 4 or 5 hrs.	2015-08-09

I have bought 4 pairs of these sandal over the last two summers and I love them. I have wider feet and I have had feet surgery, so I have has problems in finding sandals that fit well and I can wear for a long time but these sandal do very well for me.  They do not have a lot of ache support, so it may be a problem for someone who needs a lot of support but that is not my problem with my feet.  I would not call these sandals climbing sandals but I have walked all day in them and they have worked fine. Some have come tight and I have had to adjust them with water but after that they fit well. My favorite is the silver, I did not think that I would have a lot to wear them with but I do and I use them a lot. I have the Teal with white, yellow, white flower & Silver and I am looking to add more. There can dress up with shine surface or silver or the gold.  I love some of the great added designs that can be harder to find but are worth looking for early in spring. Priced between $40.00 to $50.00 a pair and last season after season it is worth the money.	2015-08-09

I have several of the old style of this shoes that I still wear to mow the lawn and other dirty outside stuff. I have bought 3 pairs of the new style and no longer have any of them. The sole fell apart within 7 months with every pair. I always said that if I won the lottery I would buy a hundred pairs of these shoes and never wear anything else. Instead I won't even buy one more pair. Disgusted!!! You took the best shoe ever and turned it into a less then average piece of crap.

I was counting on them to replace my existing pair and waited for the mailman to bring them before I left on vacation. I'm writing this review as I am on vacation because I wanted to prevent anyone else from having the same disappointment that I'm having. The sandals are cheaply made and feel flimsy when walking. I wore them out to dinner on my first night and the velcro backing on the left strap became unstiched as a result the left sandal hung off of my foot all night, forget about dancing and having a good time comfortably. Luckily I had a back up pair of sandals, again disappointing.	2015-08-09

I chose a 9.5 in the Frye Agnes ballet flat because my foot is a bit wide across my foot at the ball and my toes are a bit long.  Fyre's leather will give, in fact, can stretch considerably with wear. The sides of the Agnes ballet flat seems more substantial that that of the Carson model. The Frye Carson feels more like a skimmer type shoe while the Agnes feels more like a typical flat. The 9.5 is comfortable. The size 9 would have just fit and I think some stretching would have distorted the shoe. In the winter I wear a sock liner or sockette which works just fine with the 9.5.  Overall, I now prefer the Frye Agnes model to the Carson.	2015-08-09

Hi so I'm writing this review and I really hope someone can get help from it!<br /><br />When I first read the comments I saw a bunch of positive feedback so I assumed the negative was just from people in between sizes. Before I ordered them I went to the store and tried them on and they fit like a glove but didn't have the color I wanted to I ordered them here. However, when they arrived the sizing seemed a little off. So I went to the official Birkenstock store and asked them to check it out and they said to return them right away because there have been lots of very convincing counterfeit Birkenstock and that those fall apart quickly. When I tried on the ones at the official store I found them to be obviously not real.<br /><br />Please get them from the official store and save yourself the shipping feeds and the headache. Im contacting amazing and letting them know. But please do not order these it would be terrible to spend this much money on a scam.	2015-08-09

They are very light, well made, comfortable, and good looking. They come with removeable inserts and the soles have held up very well. I find these shoes run a full size large. I wear size 11 1/2 and bought a pair in a size 45, as per the size chart, and they are too large, although wearable. I have since purchased other Pikolinos shoes in a size 44 and am much happier with their fit. The shoebox includes a small Pikolinos shoe cleaning kit: foam brush and sample polishing cream. My shoes have held up extremely well over the past year and I highly recommend them.<br /><br />UPDATE (November 15, 2015): As with all the other Pikolinos shoes I have owned with laces, the shoelaces have not held up and I have had to replace them early. For such a expensive shoe they should have lasted longer. As a replacement, I purchased [[ASIN:B014JMSDTO Round Dress Very Thin Brown 33 inch Shoelaces 2 Pair Pack]]. Other than the laces, these shoes have been great, have really held up, and continue to look good.	2015-08-09

The manufacturer has included extra heel tips with the shoe. I did not know that heel tips can be purchased separately. Sure enough I searched on amazon and many sellers sell them. I am going to order a few of those for my other shoes.<br /><br />What do I like about this product:<br />• I ordered them in 7.5 and they are true to size.<br />• The shoes are made up of synthetic leather<br />• I ordered gray color snake and the colors and design is the same as that on amazon.<br />• The shoes are very comfortable to wear, the heels are medium height and not comfortable at all.<br />• Perfect for work or night out.<br /><br />Overall Opinion:<br />More than love it, glad I got to use and try this product. I plan to more of this brand and style in future.<br /><br />Product received at discounted rate in exchange of honest and unbiased review	2015-08-09

His feet are on the chunkier side, especially in height. I know that sounds odd but they are. DC'd have always been our go to. We tried wide fit shoes from Stride Tite and other places. They fit sometimes but they weren't ever as cute and they were more expensive and they didn't last as long. That's another reason these get 5 stars.. THEY LAST!!! Like a really long time. Over six months of daily rough 3 year old wear and the only sigh of wear on the shoes is a small piece of the rubber edge has worn down. I will always come back and buy DC's.

They fit ok, kind of uncomfortable around the ankle with the strap- I can see that being an issue if you're wearing them for an extended amount of time and your feet swell, could cause a blister.

I bought these last minute/on impulse because we were headed to the Smokies and my Chacos broke right before we left. I'm SO glad I did. They're extremely comfortable, waterproof, and hearty (not to mention super cute!). Even though I only had a mile or two to break them in before leaving, I was able to hike 10+ miles the first day on the Appalachian trail (which got moderate to intense), and my feet didn't feel it at ALL. We hiked on and off for a week all around the area, and I was never once uncomfortable. I love these boots so much. They do show mud, but because they're waterproof, it washes off easily. Also, the lugs on the bottom give a ton of traction on both trails and stone, but they clean off easily too. I have literally no complaints about these.<br /><br />Note: as per the recommendation of some other reviews, I did not tie the laces all the way to the top, and found that they were extremely comfortable without using the hooks.	2015-08-09

He was just measures and recommended a 6 1/2 toddler which I knew would leave room for growth. I was hesitant to buy these at first because they didn't have half sizes and didn't know if I should get a 6 or 7. I ended up buying the 7, preferring they be big for him to use later if necessary than to be too small. I would say they were exactly what I expect a 7 to be as they are a little big on him but still wearable with inserts. He loves them and must be comfortable because he starts jumping around when I put them on him.	2015-08-09

Beware of the sizing if you're not familiar with Onitsuka size charts. There are 3 categories for adults. Unisex, Mens, Womens. If it's not indicated, it's Unisex. And Unisex is larger than Womens. I'm guessing Unisex is ALSO Mens size. It has a very confusing sizing chart, and it is such a hassle when you order the right number size but they give you the wrong actual size. Confusing ain't it?  Update: 11/11/2015 They are very comfy and they break in almost instantly! I suggest you order a half size smaller.  I wear a women's size 8, and I should have ordered a 7.5.	2015-08-09

I should have stayed with the original size and just order a smaller width. I can still wear the shoes, they are just enough snug to be a bit tight. So now I know what size to order from Grasshoppers!	2015-08-09

Your feet are basically encased in neoprene. I cannot understand how people keep buying this brand. I made the mistake of bringing these as my only pair of shoes on a recent road trip.  I kept having to take the shoes off and stand on TOP of them to cool off. They are tolerable on a day that the temps are in the 70's, but in the 80's and 90's they are torture. I had teva's for years and never thad this problem. The neoprene is also tight- I had to actually cut the sides of the straps once my feet swelled in the heat. They were much more comfortable after this, and i was able to wear them on a five mile hike. I never got a blister and the tract was good, but my arches ached due to lack of support after long days of walking, the first time I ever had this problem. They are not inexpensive. what is the point of buying leather shoes if they cannot stretch or breathe? biggest shoe-buying mistake I ever made. I will not be returning to this brand.	2015-08-09

It was a tough call to choose between color patterns, (Apricot Flower Power or Optic Song Bird; I loved both). It is a great size bag with eight pockets/compartments for all of a girls possessions. The handle/shoulder straps are a good length not to hang too low and/or short. The bag does come with a detachable and adjustable strap, that surprisingly can be used with other Sakroots bags of similar color schemes. The handbag is great any time of year as it can showcase the carriers' style choices and personality. And the coated canvas material that the purse is made of ensures it will last for a long time.	2015-08-09

I had them for 6 months, and the right shoe started to squeak, loudly, it was almost a &#34;click&#34; in the shank box.  I complained to Wolverine and they sent me a replacement pair which is amazing, except the right shoe on that pair squeaked from day one. So I returned them, paying for return shipping again. They sent a new pair and again, one of the shoes squeaks.  So thumbs up for wolverine for standing by their product, thumbs up for the comfort and aesthetics, thumbs down, because they can't make a non-squeaky shoe.  Bummer.  I thought about returning them, but I'd just going to pay for another round of shipping for another pair of shoes that squeak.  I think I'm done with them.	2015-08-09

I do have a some what wide foot ( after my pregnancy ) and these fit perfect without having to order a wide size.

The only thing I will add for the next time I wear them is maybe some gel inserts if I am going to be wearing them the whole day. The heels are a tan color so they didn't fit the black theme but a little black shoe polish and that was fixed. I highly recommend these boots, will be buying from this company again!	2015-08-09

Fit flops are the best sandals I have ever found..I was in a bad car accident  years ago.... the result of that was a shattered ankle and 64 breaks to my tibia and fibula in my right leg.Surgery  was of course necessary and that it would be a long haul. The worst part was I was an ice skater and was planning to try out for the ice capades Anyway the accident changed all that...I am very fortunate to be alive but the accident made impossible to skate again. The ankle was so destroyed ... anyway its been 30 years and I can walk, I limp some what..but not when I wear fit flops! I have 8 pairs of them, they provide me with incredible comfort.	2015-08-09

While it's totally gorgeous and spacious (Perfect fit for all of your lady needs) after about 6 months of regular  use on the area where the buckle meets the strap it started to have peeling thread. This is alarming for me because I am a designer bag girl and all authentic designer bags that I've owned do not have this problem. This is an issue for replica purses. So while I removed the thread and am monitoring it closely, the rest of it still seems to be an authentic MK bag. I know you can find this bag cheaper at Macy's as well- Just a tip!   NOT A GENUINE MK PURSE. The thread peeled as if it was a cheap Walmart or dollar store brand purse. Very disappointing and waste of money!	2015-08-09

Some of the shoes I have purchased in the past have felt a little bit tight the first few times they were worn, but were soon very comfortable.  I purchased these shoes to wear while working in my yard, so I wore them outdoors from the beginning.  The problem is they  are more like a narrow width instead of a medium width and have never become comfortable to wear.  Because they have been worn to do yard work several times they are no longer in &#34;like new&#34; condition and cannot be returned.  Very disappointed in these shoes.	2015-08-09

I wrote a letter to BCBG asking if this was right..no response.  I spent $75 for these at the MaxAzria  store at Domain austin, the shoes crack after only 4 wearings,  If I could upload a picture I would.  I get so many compliments on them but don't ever take them off because beneath your foot will looked like a gross grey mass of cracking peeling silver plastic.  They look so cute with your foot in the sandal but  just not worth the money.  If they were made better, I would have gotten again in another color.  These are worth about $10, if I had paid that much, not a big deal but the cost and the name, I expected more.  And I expected more from a company's ccustomer service dept who completely ignored my complaint. I see you can buy the shoes now for like $29 online so they must realize the worth of this product....

Wore them to the beach today and they were great. Awesome traction no slipping when going down the steep path to beach that has a thin layer of loose sand. We're also great climbing the rocks around the tide pools. Only complaint is that because they were a little large when actually going into the ocean a decent amount of sand got inside. But overall I love them. Also comfortable for going to store and walking around town after the beach.	2015-08-09

I was looking for something with zero drop and a wide toe box. I am a varsity collegiate runner running anywhere from 30-70 miles a week. This shoe is an excellent recovery shoe as it provides much cushioning with a natural ride as well. Would not recommend this shoe for uptempo running or racing as it is QUITE heavy and sloggy feeling. BUT, it is an excellent recovery shoe.	2015-08-09

I really wanted to love them, but sadly the quality made that impossible. The Patagonia brand usually is synonymous with quality products unfortunately not in this case. When I first received this shoe one of the laces was sliced about 1/4 of the way through, no big deal I don't usually complain about that kind of stuff as long as the shoe is still functional. After breaking the show in it fit and felt great, super comfortable all day. However, about 2 months into wearing this shoe I noticed that the top inside of the shoe started to show more than the normal amount of wear. Thinking I may have just scratched it on something I didn't worry about it. About 2 weeks later the fabric ripped open and since then the hole has only gotten bigger on my right shoe. Sadly the left shoe is now showing the same wear pattern. The fabric seems to be low quality and the white foam underneath the black fabric instead of black foam to hide this type of wear is just poor design.<br /><br />I really wanted to love these, but man with the shoes looking this bad after only 4 months (started at 2 months) I just can't recommend this show, especially for the price.	2015-08-09

Though these do not have a dedicated arch support, these are so comfortable. I broke my ankle a few years ago so arch support is very important to me and I can wear these all day and be completely fine. I only wear Reef's-nothing else. My mom loved these flip flops so much [because of the color] I bought her a pair but she fell even more in love with them because they are extremely comfortable. She wears them all day. She used to wear flip flops from Old Navy but after a few hours she would have pain in her feet. Not any more! Since I bought her Reefs, it's the only pair of flip flops she wears. I have to get her more! I have been a huge Reef supporter for over ten years and recommend them to everyone!	2015-08-09

I decided to get my true shoe size, despite all the suggestions to get a half size up. When I first tried them on, they seemed a bit too tight, but only on the narrow side like I couldn't spread my toes, but they weren't crammed together, and the fit for the tips of my toes and the backs of my heels were just fine (and no pinching around the ankles). After wearing them for a little while, I realized they just needed a little break in time (I put on a thicker pair of socks to test this out, and I have normal width for my feet). Super glad I figured this out because I'd hate to have gotten a larger size and been sliding in the shoes getting blisters. The shoes look just like they are pictured, black but a little dulled. However, I applied some Honey Leather conditioner, and that is making the leather color much richer (which you should apply to your leather shoes to help them last anyway). The tread on the soles is great! Provides a lot of traction! Also the metal for the zipper and buckle seem very durable and have nice finish. All my friends think they are super cute :)	2015-08-09

I wanted to get something easier and safer to jump on/off a boat daily to/from work as I live on an island, and in that regard, I guess they work.<br /><br />The reason these get a 3/5 from me, and I've tried 2 pairs now, is that the front and edges of the shoe wear and fray very quickly making these shoes look worn and dirty way before their time and therefor not appropriate to dress presentably for work (assuming like I can you can wear dresses and sandals to work). My boss even told me to buy a new pair of shoes after only having them a few months and I became ßÉl conscience that they quickly looked unprofessional with very little reason. I have Clark wedges that have lasted way longer, on boats, bikes and work.<br /><br />I would not buy these again.	2015-08-09

I was obviously not alone in thinking that the Captain Toad Treasure Tracker levels were the best part of Super Mario 3d World, as Captain Toad now has his own game.<br /><br />In usual Nintendo fashion, this game is fun for all ages and video game skill levels.  The well designed levels are easy enough for anyone to beat, but the difficulty ramps up considerably if you want to get 100% completion on each level.<br /><br />I will say the stage selection is rather barebones, as you select levels from the pages of a book instead of an overview world.  It gets the job done though,  and this is a budget Nintendo title, so I did not see that as problematic enough to be worth losing a star.<br /><br />I have enjoyed playing this game, and highly recommend it to any fan of Nintendo.	2015-08-09

Gameplay 3 out of 5<br />The game is a bit repetitive and the whole no auto save ruins the interesting stripping mechanism on characters. You have to manually save your game. So after a couple of hours and you forget to save and turn off the console. Well, guess what? You lost a few hours of progress, which lead me to very frustrated with this game. Not too mention the whole combat thing can be cumbersome as when you make clothes that can be permanently damaged and destroyed. So guess what? All that beefing up your clothes when to waste as well as the money and items spent on it. Powering up weapons can take a while. The game makes think mortal combat had a baby with a jrpg game. When you finish an opponent you get this really funny animation of forcibly pulling an article clothing off the opponent. Though of course everything is censored and there is no nudity from what I saw in the game, though the game is rated M because of the stripping opponents mechanic. As a plus in this game, there are plenty of waifus for anyone that plays this game.<br /><br />Story 5 out of 5<br />The story is what you expect from most jrpgs, which usually take on some kind of comedic aspect of life. The game leaves you a bit confused at first, but as you get into the meaty parts of the game. The game is quite fun to play, though again the combat gets old. Especially after you get over the initial shock of stripping your opponents in combat.<br /><br />Art 5 out of 5<br />Definitely feel like I am Japan in this game, despite the whole vampire/stripping aspect of the game.<br /><br />Sound 5 out 5<br />Voices match up with the lips. Nothing more annoying in visual novel based games like this when the mouth doesn't sync up with the lips. The audio quality is great as well<br /><br />All in all 4 out of 5<br />Great action packed rpg/stripping combat game with repetitive game play and great story to follow.	2015-08-09

I've always heard how much these can make a difference in your experience and I was always skeptical  until I finally got a pair. The difference is unbelievable. When you put these on you'll hear things you never noticed before. In Battlefield 3 I can now hear tanks firing their canons before the rounds hit, and the sound of people running outside of buildings before they run in gave me a huge advantage while defending flags. When I use these for Need for Speed Rivals the sound of the engines is amazing. No matter what kind of games you play  you'll enjoy them more with these on your ears.

Installation was a bit like strapping on fetish gear, but once seated correctly it was fine. I actually like the added stability of the rubber grips and I'm not having the button issue others seem to have. I have a lot of LEDs and lights in and around my desk and was the sole reason I wanted SOMETHING for this flat black Xbone controller. This was exactly what I wanted/needed. And again, the added security of the rubber grips actually saved some hand fatigue (The Claw!). I've played with it about 6 hours so far and love it.	2015-08-09

Pros: Its works as it's supposed to after a little bit of setup. Once synced to controller, it never disconnects or has any problems! Pretty cheap compared to big name brands, or other devices that claim to provide the same function.<br /><br />Cons: Took a while to set up. I'll repost the steps that I followed to get it working.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: Didn't work when I plugged it into the front USB's on my pc. It works great on the back ones though, most likely because they are powered inputs.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS:<br /><br />1. Plug the USB converter into the computer. It will not be able to find the right driver.<br />2. Right click on Computer<br />3. Go to Properties<br />4. Click on Device Manager<br />5. Right click on the Unidentified Device<br />6.

If you grew up playing Pokemon, don't hesitate to pick up a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue and a GameBoy Color (they can be found pretty cheap used, or just go to your attic and get yours out). Sure you can emulate these games on your phone now, but the experience just isn't the same. The actual Nintendo hardware will provide you with an overwhelming onset of nostalgia, and you'll feel just as if you were a kid again.<br /><br />As far as the game itself, Red/Blue were the flagship GameBoy games, and have become classics in every sense of the term. It is incredible how much fun and adventure could be packed into a cartridge with such little on-board memory.<br /><br />Purchase one, swap out the save battery (get a CR2025, they're cheap and it's easy to replace them, don't worry. Use tape. No need for soldering). You'll be playing for hours and hours to come. You'll find yourself humming all the old town themes and battle soundtracks.<br /><br />This game is wonderful. You won't regret spending 30 or so bucks on it. Best to buy it now, as the values will likely only increase over time :)	2015-08-09

The control is fantastic and the games ...	It's the best Kinect game for Xbox one. But that's not saying much. The first kinect sports games were better. This game feels dumbed down to me, especially the soccer. I loved the soccer on the 360 one, but this one is kind of crappy. You basicly kick the ball around a bunch of stationary mannequins.  I'm incredibly disappointed in Kinect games in general with Xbox one. I thought these games would get a little more intuitive and active, but they seem to be toning it down. I think they toned down kinect games to cater to the people who were too uncoordinated to play the first vision. It's really sad, it was such a great idea, and there was so much potential. Now it's ruined, because most people are too spastic to play these games and rather then take the time to learn, they complain and hate on the technology. I don't blame the developers for letting me down, I blame the market, You Kinect haters ruined something fun.	2015-08-09

I mean, hell, even if you get the waste-box one or the Overpriced-station 4, you still need a Laptop/Desktop to use word, surf the internet, and do, oh, I don't know, A MILLION OTHER THINGS that consoles just cant. How can Microsoft/Sony argue that their systems are better than PC if you have to pay for online, wait months for critical game-fixing updates, and still have to pay $60, 5 MONTHS after the game is released? There's a simple answer: they can't. Guess what: Amazon? Started on PC. Facebook? Started on PC. The Internet itself? Started on PC. There's a really cool site: pcpartpicker.com. All you have to do is go there and start a build. Building a PC is amazingly simpler than people think. Example: CPU goes straight in to the socket, just line up the triangles on the socket and the chip itself. RAM? Believe it or not, it's as simple as plugging it in... and with PCI/PCI-E slots just like RAM slots, it's literally just like dropping things into a box and it works. There are 112,000,000 results for &#34;PC Building Guide&#34; on google. People think that PC, as a gaming platform, is dead.

I just never got the chance to, so when the time came I picked up anniversary for 360. In ways it was very good and at times it wasn't so good at all.<br /><br />Story: 3.8/4<br />It made sense, the story was simple but classic. I think the strongest in the series just because of its originality. I don't really need to go into detail about this.<br /><br />Gameplay: 3.7/4<br />Gameplay is the strongest part in the whole game (besides the story) and it was really fun such as the guns and vehicles. They were cool to use, especially guns like the pistol, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc. covenant weapons. All guns were pretty well balanced even though there weren't as many. And the way you me lee with the pistol is pretty badass when master chief flips the gun afterwards. Even though the pistol is a bit overpowered but whatever I guess. But the gameplay was great, taking down enemies is always fun. Grenades were well balanced also.<br /><br />Graphics: 3.5/4<br />Not too bad, overall good. The areas looked great and a lot of scenery in some missions. Especially indoor areas as well as outdoors, pretty good in the remake.<br /><br />Controls: 3/4<br />So, as chief when not in vehicle will be a 4/4 because it's so easy to use. But controls with vehicles were too hard to use and move around the way you wanted it to go. And especially the inaccuracy from the scorpion and warthog, it just wasn't good and got annoying at times. I'm glad they improved this in future halo games. And what's up with a warthog not being able to blow up after being hit many times? Oh well I guess was just curious about that. Ghosts and banshees weren't so easy to control either.<br /><br />Lasting appeal: 2/4<br />While the game lasted a very good amount of time, I was just annoyed that it took way too long to beat each mission. Even on a not so hard difficulty. Maybe the first 2 missions weren't so bad, but afterwards it can at least take you 40-45 minutes just to beat a mission on normal difficulty. But the second half of the game was just not so fun. (I'll get more into that on my final complaint).<br /><br />So my biggest complaint about the game, is that it drags on for too long. Definitely in the second half, and yes there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. And the flood, I didn't think it was a necessary second enemy type to bring into the game. Just sticking with the covenant would've made things a lot better. But they took it too far with the repetitive layouts and just too much flood to fight, I just started complaining around &#34;The Library.&#34; And so on afterwards just from how tedious and repetitive it was. Let me make this clear, I love this game. It was very fun to play, but like I said there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. And in the second half, I found it more annoying and repetitive with the flood rather than fun like the first half of the game was.<br /><br />So that's my reviews of Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. It's a very good game, besides the flaws that I listed. But I highly suggest you get a copy if you're a Halo fan, I guarantee you'll like it.ny times? Oh well I guess was just curious about that.

But android tv software is a bit clunky still.<br /><br />Giving the device is set up for gaming and includes a shield controller,  I thought ALL of my games from the google play store would be compatible.  Not all are available for the shield.<br /><br />If that is a problem with a bit of tinkering you can SIDE LOAD programs ot the device, but for an expensive product it seems silly to have to resort to that.<br /><br />The other benefit of the device is GRID service, where you can login to GRID servers from nvidia and play games from a PC based server. This is really cool, when it works. I have a REALLY fast ehernet connection at home and it still will stutter, freeze and kick me out.  When I say fast, I can get over 800 mps download...(its a rated 1 gig ethernet) so its fast.  Still needs serious work to function on any connection, and I shudder to think about slower ones!  I still have issues even when setting the frame rate and screen rest to 30 fps and 720p resolution.  A shame.<br /><br />Lastly you can stream some games from an nvidia equpieed laptop or desktop if the graphics chip is not that old.  This also was very buggy and despite having a newer netgear 7000R nighhawk router, it was also not functional.<br /><br />So buy the device for the potential, not the current function.  I guess I will keep for now but there are a lot of issues left to be fixed.  If you want out of the box perfection​, maybe try a cheaper amazon fire tv instead...	2015-08-09

This is primarily a collection of old demos yet it offers considerably more.  Jampak Summer 2002 features several options to choose from in the main menu, including videos that show how to unlock certain features in select games.  There are even special game saves that will instantly give the player most of the unlockables or give them instant access to different game modes in select games.  Some games cannot be played on the disc, as they just have promotional videos.  That said, there are many playable demos to choose from, nine total.<br /><br />The only real issue that I had with this otherwise fantastic demo disc is the fact that some demos randomly stop after a certain amount of time has passed.  This means that if you leave the game demo paused for even a few minutes, you'll likely be taken to a different screen or the main menu.  It would have been much better if the player had the option of finishing the level/section in its entirety and then be taken back to the main menu.  No gamer should have to rush through a demo for the sake of an invisible timer.<br /><br />I give this collection of demos, tips, and unlocks 4 out of 5 stars.	2015-08-09

This case (same one Best Buy was selling under Insignia) fits the Vita Slim perfectly. The Vita is not supposed to snap or pop into the case, it's held in by rubber grip alone, so yes, it's going to be quite snug. If you're reading the reviews and you're so worried about it, don't buy the case, there are others out there. This however will probably be the most protective case you can get. I've been using the case with my Slim for almost a year now and I've had absolutely no issues. When placing the Vita in the case put the top in flush and then push the bottom down, it will be snug, as it should be. Case loses a star because it has so few slots for games and only one slot for a memory card. They could have easily put slots on the top portion of the flap inside the case. Buy the case, or don't. I would recommend this case.	2015-08-09

I was worried about the reviews posted about broken units and the horrible support they got with dealing with manufacturer. I would of preferred to buy it in a store and get an extended warranty on it but apparently no one sells these off of shelves. So I ordered one from Amazon. Shipped fast and had it in days. So far I've had it a month or so and it works great. Not sure if I could claim it works 400 bucks worth of great but the physical build is pretty impressive. The pedals are much sturdier than I thought they would be due to there being the all metal ones they sell. I assumed these would be little different than my old Logitech plastic ones in hopes of getting people to upgrade. The T300 pedals are plastic but very substantial plastic and feel great. The brake has decent resistance and the throttle is fine too. Good enough that I doubt I will need to upgrade unless I decide I need a clutch. I also used it on my PS3 and it had no issues there. Remember to hit the PS button to set the controller to user and you're good to go. I had a brief moment of panic when it refused to work for me but that was all it was.	2015-08-09

The console itself is a sleek, well designed and engineered device.<br />The software interface takes some getting used to as the PS4 is designed to be a modern day entertainment center, serving as a gateway to multiple functions. This leads to complexity in the interface that does take some getting used to for anyone new to this multipurpose electronic entertainment device. However, once one has played around for a bit, it does become intuitive, simple and easy to use.<br />Above applies to the wireless controller also.<br /><br />I have only started playing the game The Last of Us so any comments are those of a complete novice. The graphics, story, user interface, visual and audio landscape is beautiful (I dare say mindbending but some minds are less supple than others). The concept is one that is new to me (my last foray into serious gaming were PC Classics Doom, Descent, from two decades ago) but one that helps me understand the belief that gaming will surpass movies as the leading diversion and entertainment in the near future.<br /><br />I now can't wait to go back to the game so must stop here.	2015-08-09

The kit comes with two sets of side panels for the Xbox ONE controller; one set has adjustable trigger controls and the other set is a regular panel set.  Both sets of panels have the custom embroider Scuff logos that is raised to help give some extra grip – particularly for First Person shooter games (e.g. – Call of Duty; Battlefield, Destiny etc.).  The kit also comes with a cool little key which is used to shorten or lengthen the travel of your triggers which also donned the Scuff logo.  I would have to say that for my purpose of experimenting with this kit it served its purpose.  The side panels look great and they do provide a sense of added grip.  The trigger stops work well and all of the parts fit well – they didn’t feel cheap.  This product will also get you style point as most of your friends will probably ask “hey where did you get your controller?”  At this price point I would have to say that this product was a very good purchase and I will probably buy a full blown Scuff controller with paddles in the near future.	2015-08-09

This was not a satisfying deal, only on paper. Assassins Creed Unity was an awful game for numerous reasons which I won't get too in depth such as the free running and getting stuck on invisible walls, the leveling system among other features(wtf would you introduce a fix cover system for this game?!?!). AC: Black Flag was an awesome game, but I rather talk about the system itself. I'm no &#34;fan boy&#34; of the Xbox, I simply prefer the controller and exclusives over PlayStation, but keep in mind PS4 has better hardware, which I'm fine with and knew before hand buying this system. With that said, I'm thrilled with the voice commands that they initially already had introduced with the 360 version of kinect and they vastly improved it(bought separately as this edition doesn't have it), but even the interface seems clumsy. The controller still feels great, but the in box Mic is cheap, the snap feature is redundant and not useful, at least for my needs, partying up with friends is more clumsy, the fact that you have small hard drive doesn't help matters. Granted, I also own a 360 that has 300 gb, but you didn't have to install a game onto your drive to play it. If you own good games like gta5 and witcher like myself, you literally will have no room for a decent collection and will have to beat and then delete games as needed unless purchasing an external drive, that within and of itself is bull.	2015-08-09

Ive always been a Doom fan so i honestly enjoyed this game back when it came out on in the late 90s i think. I never owned it till now.

You almost need two sticks or a mouse n keyboard to play a Doom comftorably. anyway its a decent game.	2015-08-09

My original MGS 4 &#34;Fat PS3&#34; did bite the dust, but the reason for that happening was due to either the CPU &/or GPU not being soldered in correctly (Reball was attempted by Endless Elec., but failed). I found a replacement PS3 (Launch Model 60 Gb Vers.) from Amazon Warehouse deals (Used in Excellent Condition) & did several Upgrades to it, a 19 Blade style main fan on the inside, an Evercool Defender Fan on the back & a brand new Front external fan (The Pass-Thru USB Port is a Plus!!). Not only did I add those upgrades onto the PS3, I went ahead & took the system apart (Warranty was expired anyways) & cleaned the old thermal compound off the CPU, GPU & the Heat sink & applied New Arctic Silver Thermal Compound on each side (Both the GPU, CPU & Heat Sink plates). The system itself runs like a trooper with no issues. I Have a 750 Gb HDD inside my system, so that in turn creates more heat, so I need that &#34;Extra Oomph&#34; to keep the interior & electronics cool. Also, I have always had my PS3 standing up & have never had any issues with it becoming &#34;Too Hot&#34; & it always has sounded fairly normal. The fan itself is &#34;Ultra Quiet&#34; compared to my original external fan that I had before. Note as well, as some other's have stated that this fan will only work on the Launch Model 60 Gb Ps3's & the 80 Gb PS3 MGS4 Bundle	2015-08-09

Works very well and I had no problems with neither the joystick or the buttons.I've yet to test out the PC or PS2 compatabilities, but seeing as I bought it mainly for the intention of using it with my PS3, I paid more attention to that.<br />  I can indeed confirm that the joystick does in fact make a clicking noise when you use it, but it's not as loud as one would think. When you're immersed in the game, it's hardly noticeable. It doesn't bother me anyway.<br />  The buttons are convex while my personal preference is the more traditional concave buttons, but that's a superfluous aspect; nothing that impacts what it's supposed to do.<br />  This fightstick works like a charm and is the perfect alternative to the much pricier choices out there, especially considering that this fightstick can play on multiple systems straight out of the box!<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE!!!! The only reason I don't give this product five stars is because, while the product arrived a bit sooner than anticipated, it was NOT delivered straight to my door. It was left out on the inner perimeter of my gate, where any passerby could've easily picked it up. They did not even bother to ring my doorbell to at least let me know it had arrived. If it weren't for my folks returning from an outing, I may have never received the package! My advise to everyone ordering this is to FREQUENTLY CHECK YOUR DOOR on the day it is supposed to arrive!	2015-08-09

The button choices on the controller are a bit odd and differ between the Retron menus and the games themselves.  3.  No D-pad.  The stick thing doesn't have the precision of a D-pad and it shows on some games.  I found myself fighting the controller more often than I would like, but you can always plug in a genuine old controller if this is a problem.  Which brings me to my last problem 4. the two Nintendo controller ports are on opposite sides of the unit which make plugging in an NES Advantage, which uses both ports at the same time, a dicey proposition.  You can run it with just one port though and the P1/P2 toggle just won't work.<br /><br />All said though, a worthy addition to my retro gaming room.<br /><br />If another Retron were in the works, some additional features I would like to see.<br />1: multiple USB ports, not just for charging controllers, but also for addons and modding opportunities.<br />2: the controller ports to be positioned on the same side for the same console for ease of use with certain peripherals.<br />3: Atari slot(s).<br />4: Game Gear slot.<br />5: N64 slot.	2015-08-09

US	40390924	R2UA9839R8ESOM	B00LYYN5W6	245316869	Project CARS	Video Games	5	11	12	N	N	Yawesome!	Now, I love racing games. So this was a complicated decision. I love racing games. I love arcade racing. Some titles are good and some are bad. Some games, some people say are good, ...I just don't get how that game is supposed to be good. But this one is good. You can say that it's the Dark Souls of Racing. It's tough but its so rewarding when you get it.<br /><br />Project Cars is a racing sim, its not an arcade racer like Need For Speed Rivals. I have those two games on my PS4, I'm going to draw some comparisons when I can but I'll try not to do it too much. NFS Rivals, I did love. Maybe 4.5 out of 5. Love the open world. Semi like the racing. I effing hate crashing. In NFS, it's so infuriating to take your eyes off the main screen, look at the mini map on the corner, an oncoming car shows up out of nowhere and boom. 7 second crash sequence. Time gone. Project Cars, you can turn the damage off. I put it on noob mode. And it's so nice to jump into a game, get a feel for it, and not get penalized by having your car damaged before it can finish a race. In a month, once I'm a pro, I can adjust the settings then.<br /><br />I hate the controls from the start. I was like oh jeez, did I really plunk down my cold hard cash on a game that sucks. I kept on crashing. The brakes were very different from an arcade racer. Cause you have to brake way way in advance before you hit your turn. You can't just brake on the last second like you could in the other arcade racers. This is the first time I delved deep into a driving sim. I have GT5 but since I got it cheap, I guess I didn't feel like a priority to play that right away, so I haven't yet. I know. I know.<br /><br />I love the dynamic arrows on the track. It tells you what's the best lane to pick on the road. And green means keep on going faster. And yellow and red means slow your azz down. I like those arrows, man. And the colors change too, based on how you're doing. Cause it's dynamic like that. If it's green then it turns red, you brake. And it turns back to green, that means you slowed down too much, go faster again. And I freaking love how the cockpit crew leader guy talks to me in my dualshock speaker, it makes me feel like I'm a badass professional race car driver. He's like &#34;you got a one second lead. Try to open it up a bit&#34; and I talk back to the videogame, &#34;got it boss&#34;. Freaking badass.<br /><br />So I'm not gonna bore you with the deets of the game. You can read the info on how many cars you get, what you get, where you get to drive. For me I'm not complaining. I love the sample selection.<br /><br />I also love the controls. and the viewing controls and adjustments. My favorite view is chase camera and you can control the distance to the car, whether you want to be tight to it or far away.<br /><br />I haven't played multiplayer cause I'm not a multiplayer guy. But yeah, for me I'm a satisfied customer.	2015-08-09

My mind was blown I love this game. The graphics are great, the weapons line is great. Although I  never found the game as difficult as some people say. There are some parts of the game where I got frustrated but not to the point  where I stopped playing. Oh and the humor is hilarious. I recommend this game to 3ps fans or newcomers the series. By the way if you have a PS3 I suggest getting the HD collection but you can also use the original version as well.	2015-08-09

The enemies are always overpowering like ogres being at the beginning, which you get your face smashed in. There is a bit of steep learning curve with the game's mechanics and attacks don't always follow up to being the best set of moves. Especially with the way multiple enemies can stack attacks at once and lead you to death with your main character very quickly.<br /><br />Graphics 5 out of 5<br />The animations and art was great, but the gameplay is what made me not like this game. \	2015-08-09

Shipping was extremely fast! That's about it for the positives unfortunately...<br /><br />First off,I bought this for my wii. I had one before and it was great, but this one seems to be defective or something. First thing I did was charge it, then it wouldn't turn on for some reason. Then I figured out I had to reset it, so I did. Then it worked! Now the Bad; the buttons are unresponsive at times and tend to stick, and the shoulder buttons never worked. I can't get past that. A lot of my favorite games use the shoulder buttons such as Super Castlevania 4 etc. And if you like N64 games, it's pointless. Also, if you want to switch the (X,Y) buttons with the (B,A) etc for retro games, you can't do it, not even in emulators, they simply don't work. Better stick with the classic pro controller or something. Not sure what happened with this one. Good concept for all in one solution, but poor execution.	2015-08-09

In fact either option usually leaves him frustrated with hurting ears after short periods.  He can wear this headset for hours, without it slipping or digging into his head or ears.<br />The sound quality is good, especially for being a single speaker. He usually has it plugged into his iPhone, which this has been very compatible with.  While he's not using this in the team game playing way it was necessarily intended for, when he calls me using the headset I can hear him crystal clear.<br />It's been really sturdy, and the simple twist up action to move the microphone up out of the way is pretty ingenious. Plus, when up it makes the mouthpiece very low profile, it pretty much blends into the headband. It would have been nice if it came with a protective bag, but that's a small quibble.<br />I like that he can still hear us, without us practically yelling, and that he doesn't yell at us responding because he can hear himself and ambient sounds around him. Plus, he can hear his game playing without us having to hear it.<br />He's been beyond thrilled with this head set. That such a simple design, at a bargain price of $25 bucks, was the solution to his game playing struggles is mind boggling to me, (in a good way!).	2015-08-09

I am not going to spend much time on the technical issues. To get the game to run at first I had to run it at a max of 1440x900 on a GeForce 660 GPU with the few graphics enhancements to choose from in the options turned off. I took this game as motivation to update my PC for the next generation of games. With an i7-4790k overclocked to 4.4ghz, 16gb of 2400 ram, an MSI GeForce 970, Asus Maximus Hero VII Motherboard, and the game installed to solid state drive, the game ran very well at 1080p, still capped around 30fps. I had some screen tear still during cut scenes, but this was in the game's unoptimized state when it wasn't available for purchase. For its current state, the graphics are excellent. Even at 1440x900 on the 660, graphics quality was decent. I'm sure with a few patches to fix the performance issues, it will look even better.<br /><br />This game relied WAY too much on the Batmobile. I was excited about this feature when announced, but I never expected it to take over the game. The story caters to the use of the car as much as possible. It is often obviously forced. The Riddler challenges revolve around the car. You can't proceed to certain areas without the car. There are tanks EVERYWHERE that can only be eliminated with the car. Repeated Firefly missions are more reason to use the car. I didn't enjoy the Batmobile aspects and eventually just gave up. I threw in the towel after 17 hours and just watched the rest of the story on YouTube.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story for the most part. It was predictable, as others have commented. You could see the Arkham Knight's identity coming from a million miles away, if you had some knowledge of Batman's history.<br /><br />I didn't feel gadgets played as strong of a roll in this game as previous titles in the series. I didn't bother hunting Riddler trophies in this one either though. I've done enough of that in the other games. The combat is still very fluid, identical to previous games with the exception of team take-downs where both characters deliver nicely choreographed knockout blows. The team knockouts is probably my favorite new addition to the game.<br /><br />The Penguin and Two-Face stories are bland and repetitive and have little to no story worth mentioning.<br /><br />Nightwing's humor and bluntness with Batman were great.<br /><br />Musical score is enjoyable and at times reminiscent to the Dark Knight film trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, the game is a rehash of the mechanics from the previous games in the series, often dropping some of the fun of physical combat in favor of driving the Batmobile down your throat. I loved the combat in the previous games, so I'm not complaining there, but the Batmobile is just too much too often. The story is decent, but loses momentum because it's catering to the Batmobile.<br /><br />Wait for patches. Get it on sale. If you're not into driving games, this one will probably frustrate you often.m take-downs where both characters deliver nicely choreographed knockout blows.

I'm sure this game has been reviewed to death already, lol, but since I just played it recently, I thought I'd add mine to the mix. Anyway, this game was amazing. Technically, there werent necessarily any real upgrades from Far Cry 3 as far as gameplay and such goes, although the graphics were definitely even more amazing. I'd actually say this is possibly the best looking gen 8 game yet.<br /><br />So, speaking of gameplay....it was as engaging and fun as ever. Really, I could run and drive around Kyrat all day every day and never be disappointed. There is a ton of stuff to do, plenty of objects to find, all of which carrying their own piece of a few different stories. The flight suit was also super cool.<br /><br />Troy Baker as Pagan Min was inspired. I dont know that anybody could ever top Vaas as a video game villain, but Pagan Min was right up there, and Baker played the role to perfection. There were quite a few interesting characters in the game, but Min really stole the show.<br /><br />As always, your moral choices tend to be more of the best of the worst type things. You wont really feel great about either story arc at times (there are basically two, much like with FC3). Neither really represents a &#34;good guy&#34; type scenario. Lesser of two evils kind of deal here. That said, there is a little leeway. In my playthrough, where possible, I let people live. Sometimes, that doesnt even work out well, lol.<br /><br />Anyway, the story was pretty engaging IMO. It wont win any prizes necessarily, but it does keep you interested and wanting more.<br /><br />Did I mention the elephants? Holy ##### the elephants! They are complete bad ###es, and you will defintiely want to take full advantage of your ability to ride one into an enemy outpost and wreak havoc. In fact, the first outpost I attacked, they had an elephant penned. I shot the elephant in the behind with an arrow from afar, and it basically went beserk and took care of the entire outpost for me while I watched the whole thing through my binoculars, lol.<br /><br />Did I mention the Rhinos? F### the rhinos. They are also bad ###es, and they dont really discriminate, lol. Everybody in the area is a potential target for their ill temper and rage. They are also incredibly resilient. You will waste a ton of bullets trying to take one down. Also, once they figure out that you are the one shooting at them, they definitely dont hesitate to let you know just how little they appreciated that treatment. At one point, I literally just fired a grenade launcher at an enemy courier when a rhino came out of nowhere and smashed the courier. Just then, a rebel truck and an enemy truck both rolled in and everything started attacking everythign. As I watched in amazement, and eagle swooped in and attacked me. After I fought off the eagle, looked over and gazed upon the smoking ruins that was several vehicles and a bunch of once living people, with a rhino sauntering off looking pleased with itself, I thought &#34;You know, this is what Far Cry is all about right here&#34;.<br /><br />btw....eagles....by far the most annoying and vicious creatures in a game that also features honey badger, rhinos, elephants, and so on. They move fast, they can come from any direction, are huge and can carry off smaller prey (like goats...which you will see happen), and view everything as prey. F### those eagles, lol.<br /><br />I'm sure you can tell from reading all of this that there is a lot of content and a lot of randomness in this game, which really adds to the experience. This is a living and breathing game world, and it doesnt stop just because the prodigal son (you) sees fit to wander through it.<br /><br />I cant recommend this game enough.

Has a dash move which is always 1 of my favorite powers for a skylander to have. So, he's fast. Freeze Blade is an ice skating cat. A speed skating feline is never a bad thing. Odd that such a cool creature has such a dorky voice & laughs like a complete dweeb. It's funny tho.<br /><br />  Difference between Nitro Freeze Blade & Freeze Blade is that Nitro was a Target Exclusive. Unfortunately the seller put a sticker over that part of box which takes away from it's value for collectors. Attempting to take sticker off only ruins pkg'ing. Big no no. Another difference is Nitro has a cool metallic look to him. Clothes r gold & silver on figure & in game. He's very cool looking. All special skylanders  (Exclusives, Legendary, Holiday, Enchanted) have stat boosts. So, as Freeze Blade says in his catch phrase, they're  &#34;A cut above the rest&#34;. Nothing like a little Skylander humor.<br /><br />  His attacks r fun. Anytime u r not sure of which Skylanders to get, there r tons of videos on YouTube that showcase abilities & assist u w/ path upgrade choices. Wdrumz makes great vids. I often use his vids to help me choose best path to make them as powerful as possible.<br /><br />  I got my nitro on Amazon for $10, a price I knew wouldn't last long for a special &#34;exclusive&#34; skylander, altho the sticker on pkg over &#34;Target exclusive&#34; didn't make me too happy.  I'd definitely recommend Nitro Freeze Blade or regular Freeze Blade if price is too jacked up for Nitro. Enjoy, fellow portal masters!	2015-08-09

Jak and Daxter is a fun 3d platform game that harkens to some of the great well known 3d platformers such as Mario 64. The colors are vibrant, and the environments are eye catching. Jak is easy to control, although I can't say the same for his zoomer. Collecting the precursor orbs encourages you to explore the environment. You are not able to save any progress in your game, however, without collecting a power cell. Some power cells are easy to obtain, and some are a pain. You need to collect at least one hundred to have the good ending. You need to collect EVERYTHING to get the secret ending. I enjoyed this game so much, that I bought the Jak and Daxter sequels as well.	2015-08-09

There has been a lot of people saying that this is what nba live needs to be, maybe in graphics but i disagree on anything else because there ripping you off, there is no sliders to tune the cpu down cause they will kick your a$$ even on rookie level, no create mode other then this corny &#34;rising star&#34; nonsense more like rising joke, you can not edit players or the roster without doing dynasty mode or online, i followed the supposed &#34;learn how to play guide&#34; and thats a even bigger joke, but because it was a while since i had played nba live i did what they said to do to score and my result? The cpu was up on me by 15 before i could score once and that was at rookie level, you really think ray Allen, chancy Billups or shannon brown is going to miss a open look at a 3? You think Greg Oden, lamar odom or antwan jamison are going to get knocked on there a$$es when they go for a layup or a dunk? NOT IN YOUR LIFE, seems to me that those names i just said were standouts and still are good players but yet they make these guys play like there idiots or fall on there face like there just learning how to walk or some crap, they need to keep the graphics but bring the old nba live back, cause if 16 is anything like 15?

Basically fine but I had a problem loading it because my Norton security kept telling me a Trojan virus was on the disk.

Thick rubber buttons!? No lights!? Wait a minute!.. Does it work!? Yes!	I would have given this an extra star but I received one where all buttons worked!...... except for the space bar. NOOOO! However, I think it is a good product for the price. The rubber buttons take some getting used to because they protrude high enough for a user to require more physical thumb action coordination/strength. It's kinda like using the thick rubber buttons on a universal remote where they can have a bit of motion play vs hard clicking buttons.<br /><br />ALSO! ::holds index finger up with wide eyes:: If you happen to hate vitamin D and like to submerge yourself within the seclusion of your video gaming quarters of ultimate darkness whilst relying on your TV's light to enhance the degradation of your vitamin A deficient eyeballs, then you may not like this keypad of rubber mountainous magnitude! Why!? BECAUSE THE BUTTONS DON'T LIGHT UP! Ahhhhh! NOOOO! AGAIN! ::calms down:: But if you just so happen to have some carrots lying around with a small source of light, you may just be able to bypass this minor dilemma of miniature light usefulness in your gaming domicile of undisturbed dark matter.<br /><br />Did I mention that it snaps into the controller like it should? No? Well, now I have! Ha!<br /><br />I will side note, the seller was stellar and wasted no time to refund me. I'd say give it a shot if you don't care about the button situation and just need something that is connected to your controller and not having to run back and forth to your keyboard and controller. Not sure why anyone would keep their controller and keyboard within running distance of each other, but that sounds exhausting! Especially when trying to match make in Destiny! ::breathing and sweating heavily::	2015-08-09

I should have known better than to trust a Techland game again after having my entire character completely disappear multiple times back in Dead Island. The game was really fun while it worked though so I thought I would give this one a try anyway and it really is a ridiculously fun game...until it screws you over again. I didn't lose my entire character this time, though from what I'm reading online that is still happening to people in this game too, but instead I lost several days worth of play out of nowhere. My progress and inventory just magically reset to a state they were in almost a week ago. How can this even happen in a game that's autosaving constantly??? How can this entirely new game still have the exact same enormous game destroying bugs as their previous game? Why does Techland continue to ignore this issue in their games? I know it's not just me. You can look online and find hundreds of complaints about this exact same problem in both games, yet they never fixed it in Dead Island and I doubt they'll ever fix it in this either. This is absolutely inexcusable and I will never, ever buy another indescribably frustratingly broken game developed by Techland again.	2015-08-09

I am a decent driver and was not able to get close to passing some courses  even after 20+ retries on hard mode. I've watched youtube plays on the same difficulty that were able to win with slower cars and driving errors. So I think there is something wrong with the difficulty / cars or rubber banding. You can't change cars on every stage. You can't start from the beginning of the stages to get to a gas station. Its a huge game play flaw making the game unbeatable, so I quit playing this. The positives are that I really liked the sound and the backgrounds. The course levels were designed pretty well. This game is about a 6/10.

Very crude, silly, and cheesy. You will get a few immature laughs out of it, but it's not the funniest game ever. The graphics aren't exceptional either; but with so many games released that don't work, it's nice to find something that is bug-free.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's an okay game. It's a first-person shooter/slasher that isn't afraid to be silly, but don't expect it to be the best game you play this year.	2015-08-09

This is a very detailed review. Thus review is primarily for ps4 controller but also has a lot of general important information.<br />As most PS4 players know there is a big problem with the rubber on joysticks of the controller ripping. That is why I bought these and after looking around for grip replacements and covers for a while I found that there are not many products like this to choose from. Despite some disturbing reviews of this product I decided I didn't have much choice.<br />Grip-its do not fit the ps4 controller very well, I can't comment on any other controller. The design on them is not very good. Think of grip-its like a baseball cap. When you put them on they don't snap around the under side of the joystick. It barely fits on the stick and it just wraps around the top and most of the side dome of the stick. So there is nothing much preventing it from popping off and you can see from other reviews and me that they can come off when playing.<br /><br />The grips while playing do not have much grip to them. The rubber itself it pretty slippery and the very rough little design in the center of the stick does very little to help make it grip. I constantly have to readjust my thumbs because they don't stay centered. The pattern on them is not very comfortable either. Because they are hard to grip you have to pick down on the stick harder and I find my thumbs hurting quickly. not like my whole thumb is soar but the area that is touching the grip starts to hurt and become tender. I might add I have never had a problem with my thumbs hurting before. I don't usually have a problem with my thumbs getting sweaty but with these I do. I believe it's because of the problems above and the material they are made of (might be cheap rubber). So with thumbs becoming sweaty it makes it even harder to use them. In addition to all this the surface area of the grip is smaller than the original joystick. If you don't know what I mean it's like the grip-it is a dime and the original stick is a penny.<br /><br />Overall I do not recommend buying this and highly suggest you try and find a different product.	2015-08-09

I'm not normally a Lego person, but the Lego Pirates of the Caribbean game changed that around real quick. I first tried Pirates because I'm a huge fan of those movies, and then after a while, I decided to give The Clone Wars a try. I am a huge Star Wars nerd and the Clone Wars TV show is my favorite Star Wars timeline era. As an avid watcher of the series, I was really impressed with how the story levels were made out. Of course, not all of them are as accurate as the show, for example Anakin doesn't get hurt in the Jedi Crash level, but hey, I can't complain. I also liked how music from the series was put into specific levels to either match it to the episode it was from, or to add on that epic feeling, which it did for me. Anyone who loves the Clone Wars series needs to check this game out, even if you're not a general Lego fan. You'll be glad you tried it	2015-08-09

Great for drowning out annoying family.	Pros: great headset for xbox one well worth the money i spent i bought mine at best buy while they were on sale for much cheaper than the amazon price. But oh well i own a pair. It's nice to switch from the super human hearing to normal sound and i mix pandora, destiny and party chat on these speakers and i can make out all the different stuff going on. the padding makes it comfortable and it's nice to have customizations.   Cons: pseudo wireless. Has a wire going into the xbox controller. Really have non lightweight headset. It starts to hurt ontop of your head because of the weight. The stereo sound can be a bit hard to deal with. But when you switch between superhuman hearing and normal sound one is for serious gaming for sure and the other is just chill.    Other thoughts: i can't tell why people are posting on here about XO fours when this is an XO seven product thing. There is a noticeable difference in the sound quality my friend owning a pair and me using them i do notice a difference. I can't tell which product people are reviewing on here.	2015-08-09

Games are games, regardless of region.<br />I love this sequel, it's one of my favorites despite the Game Boy limitations at the time such as DKC2 Lava and Swamp worlds merged together like taking an idea from Dragon Ball Z. 8-bit DKC2 music is good, but the 8-bit version DKC2 boss theme never made it to final even though it was originally made during beta production.<br />The adventure continues for Diddy Kong, while Dixie Kong joins the DK crew on a Kong Quest to save the Donkey Kong of today.	2015-08-09

The world is five times as big, the graphics are amazing, the story is well told, and best of all, the load times are minimal! I don't know how Rocksteady managed that considering the super high graphics quality. Lots of people don't like the Batmobile but I think it's pretty awesome (the controls are annoying initially, but you can change them so that left trigger is brake -- as should be the case -- and then it's quite smooth). My PS4 in general I'm loving as well -- the upgrade in horsepower is noticeable.	2015-08-09

I spent hours, days even, frantically seeking a new device to use as a handheld/portable emulation device. I looked at everything you can think of, from dedicated emulation portables (Dingoo, etc), Android phones, Nvidia SHIELD, etc. I own an Nvidia SHIELD Portable, a Galaxy Note 4 w/ Moga gamepad, and the list goes on. There is simply nothing as sleek, stylish, portable, and perfect as the PSP Go (especially in pearl white). It handles everything I wanted it to in terms of retro consoles, and it does so beautifully. The display makes it perfect for SNES/Genesis/GBA etc. I have large hands and feared that this seemingly perfect emulation machine would be too small or cramped for my liking, but it is ergonomically flawless in my opinion. It feels very nice in the hands, buttons are extremely responsive, and does not feel the slightest bit cheap/low quality.<br /><br />If you are into emulators/retro gaming, pick one of these up, install custom firmware on it, and you will be all set. The 16GB built-in memory gives you plenty of space for all your favorite games and retro libraries. Not to mention you can also pick up an 8GB M2 memory stick for another ~$15.<br /><br />On top of being great for emulation, you also have access to a great library of PSP games.<br /><br />This will fit in your pocket easily, look great, feel great, and play great. There is simply no better handheld on the market right now, especially at this price point. It will not handle N64 well, but you are not sacrificing much at all here because the SHIELD can hardly handle most games either. I leave my N64 emulation to my Note 4 + Moga gamepad, and it works MUCH better than such a sleek device would.<br /><br />You won't regret this purchase if you enjoy oldschool gaming. It really is a great buy.	2015-08-09

This head set is an excellent quality product. I would recommend this product because the design is well thought out; however, it is not perfect.<br /><br />As a musician I can say it is not a high-quality studio headset and I could purchase a better pair of headphones for less. But as a gaming rig it is the best product out to date.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Actually fits over my ear! Pretty comfortable, too. Sound quality is pretty good, too. Love the notion that I can replace parts instead of throwing yet another headset out.<br />I like the fact that I can use it with my i-phone.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />As indicated in other reviews, not enough power coming from my computer outputs to drive the headset speakers and the manufacturer knows it, which is why they want you to spend another bunch of money on a small power unit. I'm looking at other power source options because the add-on for the set is pricey... thinking about an external audio card from M-Audio, which is better quality at half the price.<br />The only other negative is the mic isn't all that good, as reported in other reviews before I purchased the product. The wire that supports the mic has a tendency to straighten out and I constantly have to readjust. Good mics are expensive and I guess the manufacturer wanted to hit a specific price point.	2015-08-09

I am not a hardcore Zelda fan but I've always admired the series from afar and occasionally read up on some lore and history of the series on the internet. However, growing up, one of my favorite games (and is still a top 5 game of all time) for me, was A Link to the Past. I did play a few hours of The Ocarina of Time on 3DS but it just didnt have the same effect it did on the millions of fans that love the game and series..so as you can see, i dont have a whole lot of experience with this series. Recently, i purchased a Wii U, and looking back now, I'm not sure why it took me 5 games to finally purchase Wind Waker HD. Only hearing a few gripes about how the game was a little easier than previous games in the series, i decided to give it a go and i am BLOWN away by it (get it? blown away and Wind? I'll excuse myself). Anyways the first thing i notice is the graphics. Some people dislike the Cell Shaded style but I personally love it and this game just looks amazing and it just goes to show you that simple graphics like this can be better than a realistic look...i personally think this game will lose most of its charm if the graphics were realistic. Anyways, one of the gripes of this game is that the dungeons in particular, are a lot easier than ones in previous games. I personally did not mind, I still have yet to look at a guide for any of the dungeons (Im sure im near the end of the game). Still, I do have those &#34;AHA!&#34; moments when i am stuck and finally  realize how to solve a puzzle..sometimes when all else fails, common sense prevails. The same goes for the boss battles. Although they beat me up from time to time, it was always easy figuring out the strategy to defeating them. Some of the other core elements of the game were excellent too including great characters and dialogue, the music is good and the combat is great. Also, I LOVE the bottled messages other players can leave. I am always very curious when i see a random bottle in the middle of the sea. Speaking of sea, the sailing in this game is awesome and makes the adventure that much more epic (apparently the sailing is a lot quicker than the original). There are so many great moments when sailing like when i stumbled upon an abandoned island with a bunch of marked treasures in the water. Other times, i'd get attacked by sea monsters and it was a blast fighting them. There is just so much to tallk about but this game is just amazing. The whole experience just oozes positive reviews with little to no gripes for me. If you havent played this game, DO IT NOW!	2015-08-09

I was looking on various sites such as eBay even my local Craigslist for a original Super Nintendo and they were all astronomical. I was hesitant to purchase this but thought hey I should give it a whirl, and I'm so glad I did. I wanted to get the theme song of power rangers out of my head since that's the only game my son has played all summer.

US	30573598	R261Q9Y1KCICB1	B006JKASCK	907924125	PlayStation Vita Memory Card	Video Games	1	2	4	N	Y	Super overpriced, low quality, no warranty	Bought January 18th. Stopped working August 9th.<br /><br />These things are super overpriced and they are poorly made. I did not even play mine very much.<br /><br />When it dies you will likely lose your save games unless you're a PSN+ member (uploading them automatically) as well. So sony wins both ways. You buy their overpriced memory card and you give them a monthly fee to auto backup to the cloud.<br /><br />Do you know how long it took my memory card in my phone to die? I don't know, for a couple phones i was buying a new one every 2 years and one never died.<br /><br />What about how long the memory card in my DS lasted? Don't know, it still works, although i haven't played it very much in a couple years.<br />What about the memory card in my 3ds? Still going since shortly after release.<br />What about the memory card in my 3ds New (or whatever it is called)? Still going since release.<br /><br />Do you sense a pattern here? the only memory card i've had problems with is the one i've had the least amount of time and the one i paid twice as much for.<br /><br />Edit: I recently contacted sony seeing if they would support this card. I had noticed them talking about there being a year warranty on the vita memory card so i thought what the heck. It turns out this warranty is only for the memory card that comes with the vita and not any memory card you buy on its own. So there is no warranty on this card unless you're lucky enough for it to be within the Amazon one month warranty.	2015-08-09

This is a great product.  I was pretty harsh in my review of the Turtle Beach Elite 800x... but this headset is an improvement in many ways.  Mic:  First and foremost this is a gaming headset.  It has to work perfectly in that respect or what's the point.  This mic picks up my voice crystal clear.  The mic monitoring also works great.  And the simple volume & chat controls makes it easy to adjust so that the balance is just right during a party chat.  Wireless:  Connectivity here is amazing.  Can't stress this enough.  No hissing or any noticeable clicks or anything.  Honestly it's probably the quietest headset I've ever used in terms of annoying background static/noise/hiss (that includes wired and wireless headsets).  The range is more than adequate for me to put the controller down in between matches to get a drink, bite to eat, or use the restroom (with mute on of course!) while still hearing good humored party chatter between games.  It's also worth noting that my Xbox is less than a foot away from my wireless router, but I still don't get any wireless interference.  Comfort:  The cushions are a bit stiff IMO, but the headset is so light and it doesn't squeeze into your head so it doesn't really matter.  It's no problem wearing this for an extended period of time.  The padded bar at the top is probably the best feature and keeps everything secure w/out being tight.  Not the most comfortable headset I've ever had, but it's good.  Sound:  Stereo sound is just as good as I've heard in other headsets.  Comes with a few presets to crank up the treble or bass if you want.  I'm no audiophile, but I have no complaints here.  Overall:  This is a great headset.  The best I have found for the XB1 for sure (even compared with more expensive options such as the TB Elite 800x)!  And the fact that it's 100% wireless (not even a chat cable is needed) is what really pushes it over the top.  I can't help but feel like some of TB's offerings back in the Xbox 360 days were superior, but I've been waiting impatiently for a really good XB1 headset that worked well in every area and so far this is the 1st one that checks all the main boxes.  I'm very happy with them at $150, but as the price starts to fall over time these are going to be an extremely good bargain.  5 stars!  Not because it's perfect, but for right now it's the best bang for your buck.   ***EDIT***  I did have one issue with this headset that was resolved... the mic works a little too good and picks up my breathing.  I contacted TB support and they said they would send me a foam cover for the mic head which would filter out my breathing directly on the mic.  Was glad to hear this because I had already figured that out and used a mic cover I had pulled from an older headset (which did fix the problem).  May not be necessary depending on where you keep the mic, but for me it was.	2015-08-09

It felt like I'd solve one little puzzle and then either get thrown to a cut scene with the shrink or into a chase sequence. Since each took up most of the time, it was difficult to really feel like I was enjoying the game behind the halfway point.  The controls worked well and I like the way they used the sound in the Wiimote for certain items.  At the end, however, I didn't feel connected to any of the characters.	2015-08-09

How can Microsoft/Sony argue that their systems are better than PC if you have to pay for online, wait months for critical game-fixing updates, and still have to pay $60, 5 MONTHS after the game is released? There's a simple answer: they can't. Guess what: Amazon? Started on PC. Facebook? Started on PC. The Internet itself? Started on PC. There's a really cool site: pcpartpicker.com. All you have to do is go there and start a build. Building a PC is amazingly simpler than people think. Example: CPU goes straight in to the socket, just line up the triangles on the socket and the chip itself. RAM? Believe it or not, it's as simple as plugging it in... and with PCI/PCI-E slots just like RAM slots, it's literally just like dropping things into a box and it works. There are 112,000,000 results for &#34;PC Building Guide&#34; on google. People think that PC, as a gaming platform, is dead.

I finally broke down and purchased a console so I could game with a friend online and maybe even get a little exercise.<br /><br />I love the touch screen - using just a joystick and buttons to type was something I was dreading but this works more like a tablet.  And the touch sensitivity is wonderful.  It makes navigating menus really easy.  Just watch out, the controller even when fully charged won't last more than about 3 - 4 hours.  You can keep it plugged in if you play for long periods like I sometimes do.<br /><br />The games it comes with are fun though I moved on to other games.  I like the Wii Sports and, to an extend the Wii Fit U (though this last game can be quite insulting and demoralizing if you have image issues about your weight).  Right now I probably play a little too much of the Castle Siege game which is simple but a lot of fun.<br /><br />As for the controller (joysticks and buttons), they work pretty well for this novice of such controllers.  My brother-in-law who is used to the X-Box had a little difficulty because the buttons are in a different order but managed pretty well after a little practice.<br /><br />I was disappointed it did not come with Wii Remote controllers.  I guess they assume most people who purchase the Wii U already have a Wii.  But a quick trip to the local game store solved that.  I recommend 2 of the Wii U Remote Plus controllers with the Nun Chuck.  If you shop around or haggle with your local store you can probably find a good deal on them.  I got the name brand because the off brands often had negative reviews about how reliable they were.<br /><br />In all I got what I was after: a console that is considerably less expensive than a new gaming PC which I can use to play online with a friend while also playing games that get me some exercise.	2015-08-09

I bought two of these wireless 3rd party controllers, but not for PS3, for my PC. They were plug and play compatible. As soon as I plugged the adapter into my pc it installed the drivers and I was ready to go. They showed up under controllers in control panel. Now granted all PC games that are controller friendly are much easier to run with a xbox360 controller out of the box, if you want to use this you will have to remap all the buttons game to game like any other pc controller (or use xpadder if you like keyboard/mouse emulation).	2015-08-09

This is a good game. It just falls a bit short in the graphics and sound department, as do a lot of Game Boy ports  when comparing them to the original NES versions.<br />First, the sound. It just cannot seem to fully replicate the awesome music from the NES version, though it really does try. They bring back all the original stages with their distinct tunes as they were on the original Blaster Master for NES, lacking a few notes here and there, of course.<br /><br />Now, onto graphics. of all the Blaster Master versions I have played (5 of them), this one most faithfully recreates the original enemy sprites. My only gripe is that there are certain frames of enemy animation omitted, like a certain running missile pod-thing's hatch does not open to release its projectiles like it did in the original Blaster Master, and turrets that used to fire machine gun like bursts of small projectiles now lazily jettison large spheres that move slow enough to easily be avoided.<br /><br />All in all, it's a competent remake of Blaster Master for the handheld system, but given it was made for the Game Boy Color, it should at least be animated as well as its NES predecessor, if not better. I'm comparing this title to the GBC Bionic Commando, which had excellent graphics and sound that easily went toe- to- toe with the original NES version if not surpassed it.	2015-08-09

PVE (player versus environment) and PVP (player versus player)  are your game types.  In PVE Destiny has a rich story and fairly high re-playability.  It is however very repetitive.  The DLC was nice, but was more of the same.  The PVP (the most popular part of the game) is nearly unplayable.  They have not put together a stable platform that allows for good game play.  The lag is terrible and the latests updates seem to have created more opportunities for players to use exploits and cheat.  It destroys a good game.  Bungie is pushing out DLC and not addressing the fundamentals of good game play.  They had similar problems with Halo.  Until they dedicate resources to solving this game play issue buying Destiny will likely be very disappointing for players.	2015-08-09

I was one of the first buyers of this product and I think the price in the beginning was actually around $7.50 with Amazon Prime shipping, which was amazing. The mouse lights up blue around the side and it's incredibly stylish. It glides every smoothly and worked very well while it lasted. The small button located in the right and left mouse button is used to change the DPI settings of your mouse. The 2 buttons on the side is used as a back or forward button for me when I browse the internet.<br /><br />The mouse lasted me for about 5 months before malfunctioning. During that time the biggest complaint that I was that the left mouse button wouldn't work sometimes. As an FPS player, you can see how that might be a problem. I didn't care that much though, the price was so cheap that I immediately purchased another one. This second mouse, however, was different from the first one I purchased. The texture felt downgraded and the materials felt cheap. Even the buttons on the side felt cheap and loose compared to the previous version. The mouse broke after 2 months with the left mouse button not working again!	2015-08-09

They just about got it perfect, it's straight forward to install/remove, functional with all the USB ports, and almost perfectly designed. The one flaw it has is an esthetic one, instead of going for the more $$$ white LED they went for the cheaper green LED... Being the somewhat anal graphic designer that I am, the color of the lights on most of my entertainment center is white, even the LED clock is white. The only thing not white on are the light of my Comcast cable box's ON button and a bright green LED on the Hard Drive Enclosure. It's a shame, if they had matched the white of the Xbox One, the Kinect, the controller, and TV remote it would perfectly blend in and look like it's not there... instead the external HD &#34;functioning&#34; LED comes on like Rudolph's nose on Christmas Eve.	2015-08-09

The biggest thing I don't like is that it constantly uses the internet, so if you do not have internet, or do not have a stable, constant connection, DO NOT BUY IT. Otherwise, if you have a bandwidth limit, beware when playing this game for a long period of time. This game also will send you back to the main menu if you lose your internet connection. The story in the game so far is good. I won't give any spoilers. There are plenty of cars in game, but you must earn a lot of in-game cash to be able to buy them. Car customization could be better, but this game isn't a simulation, so I didn't expect engine swaps, turbo/supercharger add-ons, etc. What's really cool is how you can modify cards for street, track, dirt, etc. One thing that bugs me is that the car sounds don't change when you switch said modification classes. For example, the Dodge Charger still sounds like the stock engine in a dirt/rally config. I did noticed when I upgraded the Skyline R34 from street to circuit version (R34 GT3), you do hear the transmission whine as you do in a race car. Kudos for that.<br /><br />If you've never played this game, I should mention it is an open world like some of their other games (Far Cry, Assassin's Creed). You can drive from New York to Miami to LA, etc. Of course, it doesn't take as long as it does in real life (which is good), but it's a very neat touch Ubisoft added in for a racing game, and I hope other game makers use this as a template for street-oriented racing games.	2015-08-09
US	34030399	RUXMPFRUGGJUA	B00YXO5UXG	555176890	Turtle Beach - Ear Force Recon 30X Chat Communicator Gaming Headset - Xbox One (compatible w/ new Xbox One controller), PS4, PC, Mac, and Mobile	Video Games	4	1	2	Y	N	Cheap but comfortable.	This is a headset made for chatting with other players while you play multiplayer video games on your XBox One.  This is made for the new xbox one with the 3.5mm jack for chat headsets, so make sure yours has this.  It's much better than the really poor one made by microsoft.<br /><br />Cheaply made but surprisingly comfortable, perhaps due to the the use of the &#34;athletic-jersey-like&#34; material on the ear cup, which I always liked and much prefer to the vinyl-type ear cups.  The mic positions itself nicely.  The &#34;non-headphone side&#34; is reasonably comfortable and should conform to most heads.<br /><br />Won't win any aesthetic awards, but for the 13 year old target audience, I guess it doesn't have to.  Nobody will ever love this functional piece of made in china consumerist plastic, but it does the job and is reasonably well designed overall.  If you are price conscious, this is a good choice.If your budget is a bit more, the [[ASIN:B005EQE0YM Ear Force X12 Gaming Headset and Amplified Stereo Sound]] is a good choice (though that one includes game audio).	2015-08-09

Efficient, and doesn't take much room up. I gave it 4 stats because I do feel that the fans on it could do better (blow instead of suck, like a vacuum, not sucking literally...oh you get what I mean.). The PS4 already has enough fans to keep it at a safe temperature, but I found it nice to be able to put the PS4 into rest mode after putting it through a rigorous game session to which it's hot, and still be able to have the fan on to cool it off.	2015-08-09

The LED's on the front of the device were not lighting up to indicate that the batteries were being charged. In fact I even inserted the included batteries into my controllers and they both read as 75% charged on the Xbox One home screen.<br /><br />I though that maybe it was just my lighting causing me not to see the LED's though so I inserted the batteries back into the charger. Now 24 hours have gone by upon doing that and the LED's still do not light up at all even if I take the batteries out and re-insert them and close the charger. Additionally, I put the batteries back in my controllers to test the charge and they STILL display as only 75% charged even after 24hours of being inside the charger.<br /><br />I should mention that after unboxing I followed all steps to install the device which are, 1: unplugging all cords from the Xbox One, 2: making sure that the lock switch is in the unlocked position, 3: gently insert the male usb end into the female usb end on the Xbox One, 4: firmly hold the Xbox One and charging unit together as you flip the switch to the LOCKED position, 5: reconnect all cables to the Xbox One, 6: insert batteries, and 7: close the top of the unit gently but firmly.<br /><br />I don't know if I just got a faulty unit or what but I'm hoping for some answers ASAP.	2015-08-09

Wow, what a horrible game...  I love the series and assassin/stealth type games in general and don't mind repetition so long as it is fun (after all, how varied can hide and seek get in silico?) But Unity doesn't suck simply because it's a tired formula or one trick pony or whatever.  It sucks because it's just so poorly made.  I got this &#34;limited edition&#34; two months ago and even with the updates, even at 20 bucks, it's still a glitchy, barely playable waste of time and money.  Buy it only if you're curious as to how shameless Ubisoft is/was for releasing such trash for 60 bucks at one point.  If you're looking to just STROLL through the city, it can be quite beautiful, yes.  But if you want to do anything action/stealth oriented with any semblance of grace, get one of the other AC games.<br /><br />Oh, and remember how you got tricked into buying or considering this game?  Watching the beautiful trailers and ads?  Just keep that in mind for Syndicate.  This kind of trash more than justifies apprehension regarding future products.  For reals.	2015-08-09

While I don't mind, its important to know if you don't want to deal with them. This game is basically a redeemable game token for the origin game. I bought this though because this way I don't need to use my bandwidth (Alaska cap). If you already own the digital version (I did) from a humble bundle etc, you can use the disk for he bandwidth, then give the code to a friend, as you are paying for one origin license not necessarily the disk.	2015-08-09

However, the 3D is subpar and--now this is the biggy--there are occasionally game breaking glitches.  Occasionally, doors simply won't open in levels.  Instead, you'll reach a dead end.  This can be fixed by restarting the level from the beginning and hoping that it doesn't happen again, but when you have an instance like that happen twice on two separate doors in the same level, you really just grow tired of the game quickly and, after multiple levels like that, you put the game away unfinished.	2015-08-09

Still laggy controls, ps2 graphics, and not much fun. Let's face it, NBA 2k has been the go to basketball game for the past decade.<br /><br />That being said, EA just needs to try a different approach. If they would focus on releasing a NBA Street game, made by EA Sports BIG, I am positive their sales will sky rocket past any Live game that has been released since Live '06. Fans have been waiting for an NBA Street release for the past 10 years.<br /><br />Why not give the people what they want? Instead of releasing Live games, create a NBA Street. For us fans, it's like missing your best friend for 10 years. Hoping to hear from them soon.<br /><br />Please bring back NBA STREET.	2015-08-09

The dog is very cute, the game is fun enough, and overall it was a good purchase.<br /><br />A few notes-<br /><br />-The stickers that you can use to decorate your Wappy were an unexpected bonus that she was very pleased with. Unfortunately they were a bit difficult to put on without cutting down, especially the eye spot. Since we weren't expecting them though I think they were still a nice thing to have.<br />-The game doesn't seem as entertaining as some of her other games (she's really in to Pokemon, Animal Crossing, and Mario games), but we weren't expecting it to be so it was fine. For a younger child or a more casual gamer, the game would be perfect.<br />-The dog is very very cute, although she was a little disappointed that it doesn't do as much as she had hoped, When you aren't playing the game, the dog will still bark and sing. Still though, the dog is her favorite part and has joined her other toys as just a cute puppy to play with.<br /><br />Overall this was a good purchase, we are very happy with it and it ended up as one of her favorite gifts of her birthday!	2015-08-09

US	24846840	R2VYO58EWK5XAF	B0007SL1Y4	80985	Madagascar	Video Games	4	0	0	N	N	What a wonderful world	"People often like to dismiss movie-licensed video game adaptations as trash quickly and hastily since the day [[ASIN:B0002VK8YA E.T.]] was partly responsible for destroying the home video game market....[[ASIN:B00004SVYQ temporarily]]. However, if you were to look at certain development teams' histories with making stuff, notably talented people that have created games you may actually know and love, you could actually discover a couple decent titles that are meant to tie-in with the incoming blockbuster. Madagascar on the Game Boy Advance fits along those lines.<br /><br />Created by the same development team that previously handled portable greats starring [[ASIN:B00005V9NJ a certain]] [[ASIN:B00007KUUE orange bandicoot]], Madagascar is a side-scrolling platforming title that follows the storyline of [[ASIN:B000AY74OG the animated film of the same name]], and also plays along the likes of those games thanks to the simple pinpoint responsiveness in its controls as well as its use of pre-rendered 2.5D graphics. The player controls the four zoo animals, Marty (zebra), Alex (lion), Gloria (hippo), and Melman (giraffe) as they find themselves on the island of Madagascar after Marty runs for the wild from New York. The secret agent-like penguins are also playable, but only for one level, so they aren't really that relevant.<br /><br />Having played [[ASIN:B0007RDM4M the Madagascar game on consoles]], I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Game Boy Advance counterpart does a fine job of staying faithful to the film's storyline; the only exception I can think of is that they felt the need to have that warthog-ish NPC character in one level of this game. Not counting the levels where a character learns new abilities, there are 14 levels in the game, and while the game does end up being rather on the short side, that doesn't mean it's a bad game.<br /><br />On the contrary, I found this game to be pretty enjoyable. For the most part, you're able to freely switch between the zoo animals at ease by tapping the L or R button, and they each provide their own unique abilities beyond the usual running and jumping; Gloria can swim, for example, and Marty can run faster and kick. Eventually, you'll earn an ability or two that makes a certain character more appealing to play as, such as Melman being able to sneeze downwards for an even higher double jump, and Alex enabling the use of claws. Some abilities are situational, while others can be beneficial to the player anytime and provide some fun elements.<br /><br />The levels mainly follow the average \\\"Go from Point A to Point B\\\\\"-type design lots of games of the genre go for, but every now and then, the game would switch it up a bit by providing a couple stealth-based levels and a couple other levels where you go find lemurs to rescue. I personally tend to have the most comfortable time playing the regular platforming levels, though. They are far from the greatest levels in the history of mankind, but they are at least multi-layered, and the gameplay and graphics spice up the overall design nicely. That said, I'd say Madagascar is indeed worthy of your time.by tapping the L or R button, and they each provide their own unique abilities beyond the usual running and jumping; Gloria can swim, for example, and Marty can run faster and kick.

Loved me some Super mario bros and Tecmo Bowl as a kid.  Was never into games at all after third or fourth grade.  Then I got into Halo a little bit a couple years after it came out.  Loved the strategies and action of real 3d running around and shooting.  It was a cool experience.  It was still kind of kid's stuff, but cool kid's stuff.  Well far cry 2 is a little more than that.  It's really kind of a strange work of video game art.  Some people (a large enough segment of the &#34;gamers&#34; out there), don't like it all that much.  Most of them basically think Far Cry 2 pushes the realism too far (some relatively, for games, long traveling through the African wilderness, etc).  I just don't think it does.  I think it works.  I think it has everything any high adrenaline video game has, and does a little more, and has more options, that's all.  In fact, you'll hear people say the game is too slow, and you'll hear people say the combat is too difficult--which are kind of opposite complaints.  Really, this game can play in multiple ways.  A large part of any action/ shooting game is just the fighting itself.  Other games have more to offer in terms of level design, ranked enemy difficulty, boss fights and things like that.  But Far Cry 2 has so much more of a varied landscape, and numbers of possible approaches and strategies to the fighting, that the combat stays as interesting as any of the best games out there, and does mainly because of its pretty unique open-world format.  Less levels and bosses, more finding new approaches and new sections of the huge, extremely varied map you've never explored  It's got all the fantasy run and gun action you could ever want in a video game, just about (which in a good shooting game has a complex chess-like element to it--live action speed chess).  Plus it's got some big themes going on.  It's philosophical about political issues, and even war and violence itself.  And it does this subtly.  The game has been criticized sometimes for &#34;not having enough story&#34; or as &#34;just a bunch of repetitive missions instead of a good story.&#34;  I just don't agree.  I like the way the story is more broad strokes in the background than a crisp, ever-present plot.  There's just enough story there to anchor everything, and no more than that.  And these sketches of plot that are there are pretty rich interesting and suggestive.  It has not just the fun side of a war fantasy, but also includes the darker side--without making the game a bummer.  It's not preachy, it just has little thought to go along with your main course of enjoyably violent exploits.  (I think they go together perfectly actually, why the h not?)  It just makes for a richer game.  It's got, the most beautiful, impressive, realistic, huge, explorable world ever created in a video game.  It doesn't feel like virtual-fantasy, but virtual -reality.  An incredibly beautifully lit African landscape with a sun that rises and sets.  There's games out there with bigger worlds that require newer technology...but no video game world is more beautifully real looking and feeling as a total package than Far Cry 2''s.  Not everything looks like a photograph, but it's really the way they illustrated sunlight that puts it over the top--and the realistic plant-life movement and weather (The new Grand Theft Auto games are real feeling--but I'd rather go to Africa myself.  And it feels more real when you move around in the &#34;first person&#34; rather than move a character around &#34;3rd person&#34;.  It's got it all--story, some good characters, and great, surprising in-play character interactions, challenging, fun action play with really endless possibilities--and it's f***ing beautiful.  You'll hear a lot about how this is a &#34;flawed&#34; game.  No, this is as good, fun and &#34;adult&#34;, as video games can get, on multiple levels.  It's a dream world where you can contemplate the nature of war and the beauty ofnature in the middle of your combats to the death.  It's great.  Maybe even a worthwhile experience..	2015-08-09

So deals the deal, I really love the remote and its slim and simple to use and you can easily navigate through Shield.<br />The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because mine just quit working after 6 weeks.  One day it just wouldn't do anything and when I tried to charge it then the remote would flash a couple times like it was trying to charge and then nothing.  I may have just got a bad unit or one with a bad battery.  I contacted Nvidia Support and they will be shipping a replacement.  I really don't like internal USB charging devices, I've had a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard do exactly the same thing.  It would not accept or hold a charge, must be cheap batteries they put in these devices.	2015-08-09

Bought this on Amazon Prime Day, so this was a great bargain. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy series, and have loved the original FFX this is a must have. I also own the PS3 remaster of this, and I was blown away by the graphics of it on the PS4. They do still use PS2 animations and models, but they were able to improve the textures of the scenery and models by 10 fold. Well done. I don't remember if this happened on the PS2, but things like their hair will blow in the wind, their accessories will bounce when they move. i.e. Rikku's googles bounce around her neck.	2015-08-09

I currently have a Turtle Beach Black Ops 2 Earforce Tango headset and it's great albeit a little pricey. I picked these up as a backup pair or ones to take with me when traveling. The fit of these are great. After about an hour or so my Tangos tend to hurt my ears but with these, I can play 2-3 hours easily without any discomfort. Overall fit is nice and not too tight or loose. The fact these fold up is a nice little touch too. The sound on these is pretty impressive. Almost on par with my Tango's if not better. Battery life is pretty solid too. I can get about 6-7 hours out of it. Charge time is fast though. After an hour or so it'll get to full charge.<br /><br />The fact this headset only cost $80 is a pretty sweet deal. The VSS (Virtual Surround Sound) is very nice. You can plug it into your MP3 player or phone and listen to music. Doesn't clutter up your setup that much since all you need to do is plug in the USB receiver and that's it.<br /><br />Only major drawback with this headset is the charge cable. Not sure why it's 6 inches long but it should be considerably longer than that for charge a use functionality. My major issue with this headset is the Sound/Chat volume switch. While it's supposed to allow you to control how loud the chat/sound from the game is, it's not all that effective. You basically are forced to choose between really loud game sound or really loud chat. There is no good in between here which is kind of irritating. I use this headset for playing Destiny and there is preset available for it with the companion app from the Playstation Store. This helps make up for the sound issue.<br /><br />Overall, really dig this headset and hoping they holdup for awhile.	2015-08-09

But I must say it is another great Nintendo platform. Nintendo games in 1080p look amazing and the improved online just works. Unlike other platforms where games are buggy, un-optimized, unpolished, cash grab $60 DLCs, Nintendo does it right. Even if games are $60 longer than other platforms, the games are quality. They always deliver polished, quality games that are fun. While the game pad is something different, Nintendo games play great on it and it is much better than the WiiMote in my opinion. I would give this platform a 9/10. For $300, it's a great deal with 2 games and loads of fun.	2015-08-09

Granted 'Revenge of the Fallen' came out in 2009, the graphics are still dated based on what else came out that year. The lighting is horrible, and there's not much you can do to fix it with the very little display options Activision offers. The gameplay is somewhat fun in Single Player but could have been developed more. The multiplayer is long dead, no one is on to play with at all so for $4.99 you get a mediocre game ported from the consoles.<br /><br />I received this for free for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-09

Being forced to do the Bat Mobile challenge in order to advance the storyline, caused me to quit the game.<br />I enjoyed the other challenges. The others were fun and taught one the mechanics of the game. Driving the Bat Mobile is like driving a NASCAR on ice with the pedal at full throttle.<br />After about 45 min, I decided that driving it was SO unfun, AND having learned that it was a big part of the game, that it was not worth doing. Also, I had upgraded it with all my points (missiles, machine gun, armor) so i could see that it was going to be a huge exp sink and take away from the fun parts/upgrades.<br /><br />It was not my cup of tea.	2015-08-09

The single player is probably the best I've played in any first person shooter but the multiplayer is less enjoyable for me (only because everyone else online is a lot better than me).

Definitely Forza (Verified purchase on both)	Okay so first best racing game out there I'm not into the simulations games like others are I'm into fun things. i don't want some way to hard to play controls its a game if i wanted hard i would go out and drive my own car. most simulations exaggerate all the controls either way nevertheless i wanted a game that was just genuine racing through and through and this provided it for me i was able to customize lots of things and peel out as long i wanted to. crash into objects and other vehicles without having some kind of restriction like other racing games i played. also you play as racer and not some under cover cop or some lame character whom is not in the racing as a sport/hobby but is in the racing scene to bring someone down or accomplish anything other than being the fastest on the road. if you are looking for a fun racing game this is it!	2015-08-09

Im no batman fan, but I can tell you that i really enjoyed the story and the gameplay. The only issue I really had from this game was the loading sessions. Dear god the loading sessions take forever. Also when you die, the Villain that kill you, mocks you and you go back into loading a loading screen. I can't tell you how frustrating it made me cause I suck and died. So over all the game is really fun to play and very appealing. Only issue is the dam loading.	2015-08-09

It is very tight race between Twisted Metal 2, Twisted Metal 4, and Twisted Metal Black. Twisted Metal 4 has a great gameplay, exquisite graphics (for Playstation), and unique characters each with their own story and unique capabilities. In my opinion, Twisted Metal 4 is a one of a kind game that did the best of its saga (before Twisted Metal Black) to give background to its characters and really allow you to immerse yourself in the game. Great game to play with a friend. Would highly recommend.	2015-08-09

I bought it when it first released but lent it out and never laid eyes on it again.  Picked it up again and I still love playing this game.<br /><br />I love being able to sneak around, using my powers to either knock the enemy out, or stick them right in the neck, or just sneak right on by.  This game allows you to really play it anyway you want -- which makes a smaller area seem like a huge map, because of the many different avenues of approach the design hands you.<br /><br />Great game.  Good story.  And replay value, for me, is very high.  Love this game.	2015-08-09
