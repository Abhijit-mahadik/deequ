The heel height is fine, nothing wrong with arches and the toe of them are extremely narrow but were quite easy to stretch out, which was great. It's the material of these shoes that completely shredded my feet.  I have huge gashes in my ankles and pinky toes from only wearing them three hours, and I wore heel socks but the sharp material tore right through them. I also put on large bandages halfway through the night and they didn't last either. The material is just too jaggedy and sharp when the shoes rub they cut.

The metallic color literally matches almost every color in your wardrobe and they dress up an outfit with ease. The only complaint I have about these is they are snug around my feet (I have a wider foot), the size was true to fit though. - I was hoping they would stretch a little bit, but they haven't too much. Because I love them so much, I just deal with it- would not recommend these for a heavy walking day.	2015-08-15

These are absolutely beautiful to look at and the quality is excellent like all Miz Mooz shoes.<br />Sadly, they arent as expected based on pics…<br />The top/toe area doesnt come up over foot as much as it looks like in pics--its doesnt show toe cleavage but it is just barely enough not to…<br />that, coupled with the sides being much more shallow and loose fitting than the pics make it look, make for very poor structure and support.<br />If you have wide feet, likely the sides will be welcome as wide as they are but the footbed is still narrow like most Miz Mooz shoes are so the fit really isnt great for narrow or wide feet, sadly.  I own nearly a dozen Miz Mooz shoes and these are the only ones I've had to return…and it is sad because they are really beautiful -- just not functionally comfy or supportive.<br />You can tie the tops tight but that didnt help the issue for me with the sides being so loose, low riding and too wide.	2015-08-15

I am absolutely amazed at the beautiful quality of these boots from top to bottom and from the inside out. The exterior is so soft and the color is so rich and elegant. The bottom support is excellent and the inside is soft and cushiony. The boots are very easy to slip on and off. I decided to buy one size larger and it was a good call. They fit perfect with a little room for thicker socks in winter. The quality and style will let you dress them up or down with just about any outfit. The way they are made, you could wear them for long periods of time. WELL DONE Rocket Dog. Thank you for a great pair of boots...	2015-08-15

I read tons of reviews before buying these and I'm so glad I did. My 3yo wears 8.5W so I needed the 9.5D. After first reading other reviews I learned that Amazon has the wrong sizes listed. Once you add the shoe to your cart you'll see the size displayed, so if you- like me- accidently added the xwide to the cart initially, you can change it. The shoe my daughter needed was 9.5 wide so that ends up being 9.5D. (Every website I looked at recommended buying 1 size larger than their current shoe size.) The shoes fit with a little room to grow but the bunny ties in the front make them fit without any gaps or bunching so they end up fitting great. You can tell this is a nicer quality ballet slipper. I'd definitely buy more from this brand as she gets older and needs bigger sizes.	2015-08-15

I got them when they were $70 and am fine with that, but I'd hate to have paid full price.<br /><br />I went half a size up and they're still slightly uncomfortably tight across the top of the foot; I really wish I'd ordered a full size up so I could've fit thicker socks in there.

I wear 9M in almost all shoes, but have a very high instep that causes me sometimes to go 1/2 size larger. Ordered these Reebok Royal trainers originally in 9M and had to return...too small, too tight. In the meantime, picked up a pair of Nike Monarch IV in 9.5M. Way too small and tight even after I loosened the laces. Tried a 10M and too big!<br /><br />Also, a lot of these shoe companies are brain damaged. Used to be sizes ran M, then E, EE, EEE, etc. Now they only offer this style in M & EEEE! Give me a break!<br /><br />Finally ordered the Reebok Royal Trainer in 9.5M. Yes they were a bit narrow and tight. Loosened up the laces and that fixed most of the tightness. Wore them every day this week and the gel insole is finally taking<br />a set which is causing the shoe to fit much better. The fit is not perfect, but is definitely tolerable. No aches, no pain, no pinching.<br /><br />Reebok is still the best shoe of this style one can find!	2015-08-15

True to Reefs these are extremely comfortable and well made. My only complaint would be that the material starts out very tight to your foot and then quickly stretches out quite a lot! The downside of this is that a) they're now a bit too loose and b) you don't know that they're too loose until it's too late to return them. Upon first wear I found the snug fit to be excellent though I didn't mind if it would loosen s small amount. However within one or two wearing a they were basically an entire size wider. I love the color and the footbed is extremely comfy so they still get 4 stars. Minus one for the tricky expanding thong.	2015-08-15

On arrival shoes felt somewhat small, but stretched out as many leather boat shoes do.  However, within a couple of months the stitching began to come out on the toe of one shoe.  In addition to any loss in functionality, the shoes always look sloppy with frayed edges of new stitch deterioration. Very disappointing for a reputable brand name.  Certainly not the Sebago hand sewns of the past.  12/07/15 update-- shoes are now ready for the garbage.  Much of the stitching on on the toe of one show is either out, frayed, or hanging loosely around the toe, and the toe has opened.  For some reason the other shoe is not as bad, but the stitching around the toe is just now starting to deteriorate. Only got a few months of relatively light wear out of a supposedly quality brand shoe.	2015-08-15

First impression is GREAT, although the bag is darker than it appears in the online photos.  Maybe it's just my monitor, but my bag is actually close to navy in color.

EASILY holds all of my &quot;stuff&quot;  My only concern is that I had a bit of fraying at the bottom seams of the two main pockets, which are made of a silky type of fabric.  I reeeally hope the seams don't fray any more and end up giving out.<br /><br />03-15-2016  UPDATE:  I love this purse even more than I did when it first arrived!

Attractiveness?  (Well, you know, it's a hush puppy).  I had my pair for about 2 years and wore them about 2-3 days per week.  Finally one shoe split at the top side and inside foam pushed out.  The shoes were just not comfortable enough to take to shoe shop for $20.00 repair.  Luckily, I bought these shoes sale for about 30 bucks at a department store.  Would I buy them again, even at 30 dollars?  Nope.  Not comfortable enough.	2015-08-15

I took one star off because they seemed to run a bit large. Additionally, the area of sandal at the toe box is fused, making what in my eyes could have been an adjustable option for wider feet not possible. I have bunions and while it wasn't tight per se, it wasn't completely forgiving either. The sole of the shoe is extremely comfortable and even with the negatives listed above, I forgot I had the shoes on. I did go ahead and exchange for a smaller size (8 for a 7.5), so I'm hoping the slight decrease in size will correct the 1/4-1/2 inch in length that seemed too big on my foot.	2015-08-15

It is a very nice bag, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Note that it's 7&#34;x10&#34;, not 8&#34;x10&#34; as currently listed on Amazon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Perfect deep teal color.<br />2. Heavy, high-quality leather<br />3. Loads of pockets to help keep things organized: back outside, front inside (just under the flap), slender inside pocket behind that, and then the main compartment has a zipper pocket on one side and an open stash pocket on the other side.<br />4. Adjustable-length shoulder strap.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I am tall, and to wear this messenger style, the strap is a little short... but it still works.<br /><br />Other:<br />1. I couldn't tell online, but the buckle on the front is for show and conceals a magnetic clasp underneath. Similarly, the back pocket is not entirely open and has a small magnetic clasp<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to get this bag at a considerable discount from its current price on Amazon and other sites, so I'm feeling pretty lucky about that. (Oh, I get it. I actually bought it from Amazon, but now it's only third-party sellers.)<br /><br />Among the things I most love about this bag is that I can expect to have it for years because it's such nice leather and so well made.	2015-08-15

I'd recommend this one over a snap wallet because the zipper ensures that nothing will fall out.<br /><br />to make this clear, this wallet isn't mine, but everytime I have to go find it or fish something out of it, I always admire the zipper. The zipper is extremely satisfying to zip back and forth. It's so solid and smooth. Most zippers have a lot of play in them, or have a cheap/small feel to them. This wallet certainly got the zipper right. I wish all zippers were like this. Anyways, it's a great wallet. The leather is supple and smooth as advertised.	2015-08-15

They had a very mild leather smell. They are pretty stylish as well a kids/ toddler shoes go. They are slip ons so it is very easy for even younger kids to put them on and take off by themselves.

Very flattering proportions and minimizes the size of your feet. I had to order a half size down because my normal size (9.5) was too big. Even with the smaller size I have some issues with my heel slipping out. So if you're prone to that problem (which I am) you might want to look for a different shoe.<br /><br />Note that the &#34;red&#34; is actually carnation pink. Still nice, but not appropriate for winter, and definitely not something anyone would call red.	2015-08-15

I bought this cross body bag because I was going on a weekend getaway to Orlando. It was pretty cheap and came right on time. The first time I used it, was the day we left on the way to the airport....Friday morning. Prior to that, it had been sitting in my suitcase, right on top for easy access. The weekend went by and as I was coming back home on Monday, the zipper jammed and the strap broke. Needless to say I was pissed but at least I was back in NY and no longer needed it. During the trip, it wasn't filled to capacity even though there were 3 compartments. It was tiny but roomy hence why I didn't understand what caused the damage. I'm not much of body bag person but I wanted this because of all the activities we had planned and it was convenient. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it pretty much survived the trip and at least waited until I got to NY to fall apart. I wouldn't recommend this at all.	2015-08-15

I've found there is just barely enough space in this bag to add either a 4&#34;x6&#34; notebook or my Kindle Paperwhite (no case) on top of all the things I planned to carry. The attached picture shows the entire contents of my purse as of today, except for my iPhone 5s, which I used to take the picture. I definitely notice when it is getting too full of receipts and junk, which motivates me to clean it out.<br /><br />I am buying a second Baggallini Plaza Mini after buying this one about 18 months ago. It is still sturdy and usable, but it is getting grungy. I use it every day and the dirt and ballpoint pen marks are starting to get to me. Dirt shows a lot on the light fabric.<br /><br />Although Baggallini says not to wash in the washing machine, I've washed it a couple of times on the gentle cycle (air dry). Machine washing hasn't done any damage that I can see. This gets out most of the dirt, but not all.	2015-08-15

This is my fourth pair of Tatiana shoes. I like the way they look and fit in with different types of outfits - casual to dressier.

These Coleman Women's Polarized Glasses are my new favorite sunglasses.  From the minuette I put them on I could tell I loved them, and I am very picky about my glasses.  I hate when they are to tight or small around my eyes, I also can't stand when the are so dark I can hardly see.  These are perfect and these have enhanced vision effect that makes everything more alive looking.  The grass is greener and the light is not to bright for your eyes.  It tones down the light but gives you a kind of HD vision.  They fit great and cover my eyes with a nice range.  I have light sensitivity and these are providing me the coverage I need.  I have even had my friends driving with me one day and they tried them and now they want a pair for themselves.<br /><br />The sunglasses are brown with brown lenses, hinged arms and some lovely etching on the inside of the arms and gold details.  they look great and go with just about anything.  I will be getting these is the future when this pair gets scratched or ruined or just old, I will re-order since these are so perfect.  Great buy.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I did receive these at a discount for my honest unbiased review.	2015-08-15

I never wore this kind of Skechers, before, and like the style and color.  Upon arrival, the shoes fit a little tight, and the form of the back heel area, caused my heel to slip out of the shoe.  If I would exchange it for a smaller size, I believe the shoes would be too tight.  So, I bought a pair of heel grips, which took care of the problem.  I am now enjoying another perfect pair of Skechers that I needed for the occasion.  Thank you.	2015-08-15

Shipping was very fast!  I read many of the reviews before I purchased this product so I was a little wary about the fit.  A few reviewers stated the shoes were too small and had to order a size up from what they usually ordered.  I took a chance and ordered mine in the same size as other Dansko products that I have, size 38.  I was so excited to get my flip flops today so as soon as they arrived, I tried them on.  At first the shoe seemed to be a bit loose in the width but once my foot sand into the foot bed it wasn't an issue.  I wore these sandals right away to an event where I would be walking and on my feet for a few hours.  I had no issues.  They are so comfortable!  I think these will be my favorite go-to flip flops.	2015-08-15

But here I am to say that these are the most comfortable shoes that have ever been placed on my feet! Right out of the box I couldn't resist just wearing them around the house, and I normally can't even stand to wear slippers at home for more than a few minutes. Wore them to work on a 90 degree day inclduing some errands outdoors and they felt warm but not uncomfortably so (inside in the air conditioning they were a dream). That's saying a lot for a bootie if they can be wearable in high heat and not make you want to through them off, though not recommending for entire days in the sun of course.<br /><br />Originally bought these for an upcoming Euro trip  and I can't wait to wear these across airports and around the city because I know my feet will be enveloped by a cloud. I think these will very good use even after the trip and I'm already anticipating a repeat buy should they ever get damaged!<br /><br />Style wise they are simple yet cute, not the most fashionable booties you can buy but the comfort far far outweighs that. They will go with anything, jeans, leggings, dress, skirt.<br /><br />The insoles are removable and washable, a big plus. In fact I think the entire shoe is supposed to be washable.<br /><br />As far as support, there is some but if you need a firmer sole you can always remove the one it comes with and place your own.<br /><br />Havn't tried in rain but I splashed water on them and the beads rolled off, didn't soak through.<br /><br />Extra points for being a vegan shoe.	2015-08-15

Too bad the stitching that attached the lining to the outer shell came almost completely apart in a month of not even daily or heavy use. This probably resulted from the lining being too much smaller than the bag itself so the stitching ends up carrying too much of the weight. I never carried anything too heavy--at most a couple of regular sized books and light necessities. I can't recommend it.	2015-08-15

US	21159753	R2JI7GYB2S5ZGT	B00R78RPM4	871653863	New Balance Men's Vazee Pace Running Shoe	Shoes	4	8	8	N	N	New Balance Men's Vazee Pace Running Shoes (Grey/Yellow) (10-D US)	New Balance has released a new line of running shoes it calls the Vazee Pace Running Shoe. This lightweight shoe is only 8½&quot; ounces and is manufactured with a mostly synthetic textile material upper and a blown rubber outer sole. By comparison, my everyday Adidas walking shoes weight in at over 15 ounces each. This Vazee Pace running shoe has a removable insole and would fall under the category of a &quot;neutral running shoe&quot;; I'll comment on that later in this review.<br /><br />This running shoe has a nice, not too jazzed up, stylish look suitable for an older gentleman like me. That is just one of the features that I liked about these shoes. The upper shoe has a variety of grays from light grey to dark charcoal. The New Balance logo is silver and even the shoelaces are medium grey. The side sole is white with a slash of bright yellow along the side and around the heel. The under sole is also a combination of black, grey, white and bright yellow. As I said earlier, this shoe was designed to include a mature man. I also appreciated that the synthetic body of the shoe is breathable and allows adequate ventilation to the foot.<br /><br />The soft inside is amazingly comfortable. According to New Balance: &quot;The midfoot bootie wraps your arch like a second skin for a sleek, fast feel.&quot; I'm not sure what a &quot;fast feel&quot; is supposed to feel like, but this is the most snug, comfortable athletic shoe I have ever worn. Some reviews were critical of this shoe's snugness. Any athlete who wears a shoe that allows movement of the foot inside the shoes is courting disaster; blistered feet will stop the wearer right in their tracks. This shoe has a smooth seamless midfoot and forefoot that, along with its snug fit, will eliminate this kind of foot damage. This is the third feature that I really like. New Balance also comments concerning the blown rubber sole: &quot;The REVlite foam midsole helps energize every step every stride.&quot;<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this New Balance running shoe would be categorized as a &quot;neutral running shoe.&quot; By definition that means this kind of running shoe emphasizes cushioning over stability. It usually means that they will be softer and more flexible than the more supportive running shoes. This concerned me because I have two obstacles: (1) flat feet and (2) a heart condition. With help, I have moved my exercise regime forward over the past few years from walking, to speed walking, to jogging on a treadmill at home. My doctor has recently given me the green light to jog outdoors over to a local school and do some moderate running of their track. To do this well, I needed a better pair of running shoes.<br /><br />Here is why choosing a &quot;neutral running shoe&quot; could be a mistake for me. Since I have flat feet I need arch support, something &quot;neutral running shoes&quot; are not known for having much of. This new New Balance running shoe does have a modest built-in arch support; not a lot, but some. Most runners know what the word &quot;pronation&quot; means as it relates to running. Pronation describes how the foot rotates sideways through each step; the foot should rotate about 15 degrees toward the arch. Because I have flat feet, my feet overpronate toward the arch, putting my weight almost entirely on the big toe and the adjacent toe instead of being distributed evenly over all of my toes. Thus, walking, jogging or running for some length of time may result in two very tender and painful toes and toenails.<br /><br />Like most running shoes these days, this pair has a &quot;heel to toe&quot; or a &quot;midsole to toe&quot; variance (I'm not sure what method New Balance uses to calculate this variance), which is how much higher the toe is from the heel or the midsole; this difference is also referred to as the &quot;toe drop&quot;. Some running shoes have a 10mm to 12mm toe drop, so the modest 6mm differential in these New Balance running shoes actually makes it easier to land on the midsole or forefoot while running.<br /><br />This running shoes not only has a modest arch, which not all &quot;neutral running shoes&quot; have, but it also has a relatively wide sole at the midsole of 4½&quot;, which does provide some stability for walkers/runners like me. Having these two pluses built into these New Balance running shoes, I decided to put them to the test. I've been walking on our treadmill and jogging/running on the school track for about a month and so far I am generally pleased with this pair of New Balance Vazee Pace running shoes. Only time with tell whether they will be suitable for the long haul.ctually makes it easier to land on the midsole or forefoot while running.<br /><br />This running shoes not only has a modest arch, which not all &quot;neutral running shoes&quot; have, but it also has a relatively wide sole at the midsole of 4½&quot;, which does provide some stability for walkers/runners like me.

The only place these sometimes rub a little bit is at the very back at the Achilles tendon, but only if I try to walk fast for a long stretch. You can leave them slightly unzipped if this happens. I've worn these all day and into the evening with no issues at all. Dresses up a more casual outfit, and also goes nicely with a cute little dress or romper for evening.

Don't know what kind of chemical were used in the making of it.  After a few washings in my sink with a gentle soap, it no longer smelled.  It didn't fade once during the 3-4 washings either. It does hang low, almost to my knee and I'm 5'5&#34;.  I tried tying up the strap, but that didn't work, it was hard to get around my head.  So my husband had the idea to use a rubberband from the inside.  That worked great.  It does had a huge &#34;purse&#34; part, which is why it hung so low, especially once you put a few things in it. I really do like it though. I also used a small zip up pouch for small items that I didn't want to have to fish for inside of it. It worked great for our vacation, I could carry the things that I needed while on vacation and walking around, but then I could fold it up to fit into my backpack once I got onto the plane. The price was affordable at under $10. I didn't want to spend much on something I really won't use that often. No regrets on this purchase, I would recommend the bag to anyone.	2015-08-15

Merrell boots tend to run slightly tighter/smaller than most other brands, so keep that in mind. Don't confuse these with the regular moab mid-cut boots, which provide little ankle support at all. These boots don't provide as much ankle support as full heavy hiking boots, but a pair is about 1 lb lighter than most hiking boots, and they ventilate well, so the Moab Peak strikes a great balance between, support and weight. The sole/tread pattern of the Moab Peak Boot seems identical to the moab low-cut shoes. It doesn't perform that great on mud or wet rocks, and in these conditions I really miss the deep lugs of full hiking boots, but again, this boot balances performance with weight. For me the boot had very little break-in period. I haven't found a brand of boot that comes with great lasting stock insoles, so I replace them immediately with superfeet insoles. As for waterproofness, I can't say how well they hold up under heavy wet conditions, but if you're expecting to be hiking all day in the rain or wetness then you should probably be bringing another bootr. This boot in my opinion is optimized for warm arid conditions with the occasional stream crossing. I used these boots on a summer backpacking trip to the summit of Mt. Whitney in California and they did very well. In summary, I these boots strike an excellent balance of cost, weight, support, and waterproofness if you hike in warm arid environments and you're looking for something that provides more support than a low cut, but isn't as heavy, hot or expensive as a full hiking boot.	2015-08-15

The finish on the gold ones is more of a crackle finish which is lovely and the gold is not a real deep yellow gold, it's more of a lighter gold, very much as it appears on the picture. The black pair has gold accents. Both are lovely but after wearing them around the house for about 10 minutes each the straps really bothered me so I'll have to see if I can adjust to them and hopefully they will stretch, if not I will be sending them back.	2015-08-15

I took the advise of those who suggested buying a larger shoe.  I am a size 10.5  (sizing chart says US 10.5=EUR 45).  So I bought a size 11 (EUR 45.5).  My new Exums arrive, which I really like.  Here's the thing.  Right on the inside tongue is a nice little chart.  It says &#34;US 11 / EUR 44.5.&#34;  There you have it.  A size 11 should be 45.5.  They are sending you a 44.5 which is between a US size 10 and 10.5.  They are made in Korea and someone is using a different sizing chart.  Buyer beware.	2015-08-15

Bought them to use riding on a motorcycle. They work great for that. The left one has a white toe, the right one has a black toe. Not sure if that was a mistake or how they are, but it looks cool.

Another lesson, not to buy something just because it's cheap.  I bought them because of the brand and I really liked two other Aerosoles shoes I bought.  I step out of the shoe constantly.  I put in insoles which helped a little.  I will buy heel grips to see if that we help me stepping out of my shoe.  I may have to limit wearing these shoes to when I wear socks.  Nice look if I don't move but unhappy with the way they fit.  UPDATE: 8/26/15.  After wearing the shoes twice, using insoles, heel grips and socks, nothing prevents me from slipping out of this shoe.  Even wearing socks resulted in the socks bunching up around my feet.  I'm returning them.	2015-08-15

These are very comfortable sandals once you get them broken in.  At first, they will very tight and uncomfortable, but don't worry.  After you wear them for about a week they will fit great.  The sandals mold to your feet and will become very comfortable.  A few tips for breaking them in:  First, submerge them in water while on your feet, and then wear them around while they are still wet.  This will stretch the fabric and help speed up the break in process.  Do this a few times.  Second, wear them around the house as much as you can, and try it with socks (not a great fashion statement, but it certainly makes them more bearable to wear).  Lastly, store them with tennis balls wedged under the straps to keep them from shrinking back.	2015-08-15

They are polarized. Bought them to address headlight glare.  In my case they had NO effect.  At night glare was still an issue.  They DID &#34;brighten&#34; the view at dusk.  The nose piece is not quite as comfortable as I would have liked but I wore them all day and they fit fine.  When you look at what's out there they stand out when it comes to price and probably perform as well as any other yellow tint / blue blocker polarized lens.  So they get high marks for being what they are:  polarized yellow lens blue blockers at a good price.  But if you have a night driving &#34;glare&#34; problem they might not provide a major benefit.	2015-08-15

But the main reason I bought them is, on really hot days, my plastic horn-rim sunglasses block air flow to my face so that my forehead drips sweat down into my eyes, which is not only uncomfortable but, while driving, is dangerous.  These are better on those really hot days.  Also, the thin temple pieces above my eye line don't block my lateral vision.  When folded, the tips of the temple pieces touch the interior of the lenses & are bound to scratch them.  At &#60;$10, I'll be satisfied if they last one season	2015-08-15

Definitely run narrow. Because shoe sizes can vary, I usually wear between a 6 and a 7. They were a lightning deal, so I tried ordering a 6.5 M and a 7 M. Both were way too narrow to be comfortable, and the 7 left too much room in the toe. If the 6.5 had been wider it would have been perfect. I would recommend ordering the wide version (C/D) of your size if you usually order medium (M) width shoes. If these go on sale again I'm definitely going to try a 6.5 C/D.	2015-08-15

These Dingo slouch boots are amazing. Really.<br /><br />I have the worst foot conditions for western boot wearing: small foot size, very high arches and wide feet. Just getting my feet into my Ariat Ramblers (9.5 EE- my usual tennis-shoe size) involved swearing, painful fingers from the pull-straps on the boot tops, and plastic bags on my feet. Then, the pressure across the arches of my feet was amazing. I ended up having to remove the insoles to make them fit properly, and now they’re fine. The Rawhide (10 EE) boots were more difficult, because the leather was stiffer. In both cases, getting the boots on initially was never easy, and invariably had me standing up and pulling, muttering under my breath. This is because the &#34;throat&#34; of the Ariat boots is very tight and can only be loosened by repeated usage or stretching. i just wear them until they fit.<br /><br />I ordered these Dingo boots last Friday and they arrived today (Monday). I took off the shoes I was wearing, and unboxed these. Pulled the boots out of the plastic bags, removed the paper from the foot and put my left boot on.<br /><br />While sitting, the boot popped right on. No pressure. No pain. No aggravation.<br /><br />Then the right boot. Same story- popped right on.<br /><br />I’ve been wearing them for a couple of hours now, and love them.<br /><br />Their “golden condor” coloring is exactly what I was going for. The fit seems perfect and the heels aren’t too high. The small brass detailing on the toe looks nice. The sole of the boots is leather, and the heel is rubber.<br /><br />I won't be wearing them in the mud or snow, but they are somewhat lined, and again, incredibly comfortable.<br /><br />If you have high arches and wide feet, as I do, I can’t recommend these enough.<br /><br />I’ll post an update if the boots do anything negative. Until then, enjoy!	2015-08-15

Looks narrow on the outside but I have wide feet and its actually quite comfortable and wide inside.  Flat soles throughout so wouldn't recommend for someone needing arch support.	2015-08-15

When I initially measured my prescription glasses, I thought an extra small size would be a right fit. However, the extra small was too small to completely cover my glasses. Thus I returned it and ordered a small size again. It is now a perfect fit. My glasses are perfectly covered by these sunglasses and these sunglasses look great. I use these when I drive a car. It is not expensive and I can now drive with a clear vision. It doesn't block glares reflected from windows or metal parts of other cars. But, my wife told me that is normal unless the lenses are very dark in color. I ordered one more set for driving my second car. Very satisfied.	2015-08-15

At first I was skeptical to try ones without the &#34;thong&#34; (strap between the toe) because I was afraid that my toes would look funny the whole toes sticking out, instead of just half of it, and to my surprise, it showed only half, the way I would have preferred it.  The color (Taupe) is as picture shows, which blends in nicely to my skin tone.  The tanner you are, the prettier the color.  The fit is true to size.  They are very comfy, and slim looking (nothing bulky).  These are very, VERY pretty gladiators!!!	2015-08-15

These glasses were packed well and shipped very fast. After opening them I found the frame to be very thin (kinda flimsy) and the lenses were very hard to see out of because of the overwhelming color. However, these would be great as costume additions or used when you aren't in need of real sunglasses. I feel with everyday wear and tear they would break pretty quickly.	2015-08-15

I normally buy my reading glasses at CostCo. But CostCo rotates the style of glasses so you don't always get the same thing from time to time. This time I didn't pay enough attention, too fixated on the strength and shape of the glasses, and didn't notice that the CostCo selection were all this light weight soft plastic material. The CostCo glasses don't have the bendable nose pieces, rather the nose part is molded into the plastic and they slip down my nose.<br /><br />Thes Gamma Ray brand glasses don't have spring loaded ear pieces, but they fit snug and don't slide around. From now on I'll be careful to select metal frame glasses that can be bent to better shape them to my face. The weight is certainly much more than the light weight CostCo glasses but to tell you the truth the weight just doesn't make a difference to me.<br /><br />I recommend these glasses and will buy them again.	2015-08-15

This is the new version of the Jacardia and it's not quite as great. They are really cute and comfortable as I expected, but they are just a touch too long around my toes.

The first time I wore the Terran Lattice Sandal I scuffed the toes up just walking fast around my neighborhood. I have worn my Jacardia doing the exact same activity for over 2 years and no scuffs. I hate saying anything negative about a merrell shoe because they are my favorite, but when the price for Jacardia is double the Terran Lattice I have to at least try them. :)	2015-08-15

The shoes I recieved were manufactured in 2006 so I'm not sure if these are made anymore and quantities seem to be limited so I wouldn't hesitate to buy a pair if you are interested.

These sunglasses are fantastic.  Their detail around the rims are woodgrain and just a great tone and shade of woodgrain to flatter almost any skin tone or hair color.

These, however, just make a girls' skin pop and her complexion on her face shine!<br /><br />The lenses are a deep bronze brown and keep the horrible sun glare at bay.  I wear these at work for 8 hours while I'm outside and think they are fantastic.  I've gotten a lot of compliments since I've acquired them and everyone wants to know where I found them.

Three of them (2 black...of which one broke, and navy) have been size XXS and one pair (white) is XXXS.  I wish the sizes were more consistent.  I will hesitate to order online again as I am better off being able to try them on. My problem with this is the only store I ever saw them is in South Carolina and I live in CT.  I just buy a new color every year on vacation! That being said, these continue to be the only &#34;flip flop&#34; I can tolerate between my toes.  I have a very high arch and these sandals give so much support and are so comfortable!!!	2015-08-15

We just went to a huge farmers market and were there for around four hours and she danced to the live music and walked the entire time happily.  When we left I asked her if the shoes were still &#34;comfy&#34; and she said &#34;yep&#34;.  I definitely recommend these shoes.

I can dance in them. No pinches or binding anywhere. The velcro stays put. The yellow ones go with anything. I wear an 8.5-9, mostly 9 in the summertime (when feet are bigger), and the 40s fit perfectly. Super cute. Lots of compliments.

There are also multiple mars in the &#34;leather&#34; outer, when they came out of the box.

As other posters have noted, the shoes arrived with gel support pads, extra heel covers and charms, and a cute little hand mirror. The only thing I'm a tad wary of is the clasp on the back - it doesn't look terribly secure and I'm a little worried about whether they'll stay on all night at a wedding - will report back at the end of September.

I usually wear between size 6 & 61/2 in heels/ sneakers so I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews about the size not being consistent. I however went with my gut & ordered a size 6 1/2 as I thought the 7 would have been too big even with socks on. I'm glad I decided to choose the 6 1/2!!! It fits perfectly. I can wear medium thickness socks with them & they will still be comfy. I thought the legs would be a bit snug, but they have some room in them that I can wear my skinny jeans inside, or my boot cut jeans outside. I love that about them! I think once you know your size you will choose well. I have a slightly wide width foot, but these are wide enough in front that my toes aren't squeezing. I can't wait to wear them on my Christmas vacation!!!<br />I gave this four stars only because although there are adjustable straps around the ankle & calf, they don't really make that much of a difference to me. They are super comfy though.<br />Made with high quality materials.	2015-08-15

He has been wearing a smaller version of these (with the Puma animal logo) and these are even better.  We like the fact that the light effect isn't generic but lightning bolts up the shoe in the red side portion of the logo.  It's really cool.<br />They hold up well to school, the playground, hiking, and all-around town.  He wears them daily and they look great.	2015-08-15

I really liked the shoes, the color is great (I had tried the yellow) but the middle straps are just too narrow with the large decorative section.

My grandson put them on to wear them to the state fair and half way through the day a piece of the material of the top toe seam of the shoe came off literally.  So, now you can put your finger into the inside of the shoe from the top.  This is ridiculous as they were very expensive.  I would like a replacement but do not know how to return them for reimbursement or replacement.  If someone could help me out, I would appreciate it.  They were the size 3 shoes.  I hope this gets into the hands of the right person.  Thank you.	2015-08-15

The brand suggested to go a half size up from your street shoes, and since I am between a 9.5 and 10, I decided to take chance and go for the 10. When I buy my second my in a different color, I'll be going 10.5. They were mostly cramped in the toe, but after two hours dancing in them my toes didn't hurt much worse than when I first put them on. I expect after a few lessons and a chance to break them in, they'll start to feel better. As for their purpose, I had no problems dancing in them: they were smooth enough to let me spin without issue and gave me traction so I wasn't spinning out of control. First impressions, I am pleased with them, but time will tell how they hold up.	2015-08-15

A+	I thought this purse was super cute when i noticed it online and it reminded me of designer purses that i see at the mall. This arrived quickly by mail and was well wrapped to prevent any sort of damage. The bag arrived and i immediately had to open it up and I'm really pleased with this bag.  I purchased it because I have a 2 year old and this was a great price for a purse and I don't like to spend a ton as my daughter always manages to destroy my belongings. The metal piece on the front was a little thinner than i expected it to be but honestly, I don't expect perfection as the price is low.  The black color and design is stylish and the inside is a perfect size for me. I like medium bags and there is even a pocket inside the bag. The zippers seem durable and so does the decorative metal that surrounds the shoulder strap. I chose black because it hides stains and this is some sort of leather that if my child manages to get food on it then I can just wipe the bag with a wipe and it's clean once again. I usually keep a small wallet, 2 diapers and a container of wipes and it all fits.  I did receive a discount when I purchased the bag and this is my honest opinion that is not at all swayed by the fact I received a discount.  Overall, the bag is super cute and stylish.  It's not as well made as one of my coach bags but it is still durable and at this price,  I didn't expect perfection but it is pretty darn close and I'm really happy I ordered this bag and would recommend it to other moms who want a medium sized bag that if it gets destroyed by a kid, then you aren't out a ton of money.  I'm really pleased and would recommend this to mom's or single women looking for a stylish bag that goes with everything.	2015-08-15

Girlie and strong at the same time, so got my cake and eating it too - haha.  I ordered half-size up after contacting the supplier directly, good thing or would've been too small.

I was hoping for a more blush, or pink tone leather.	2015-08-15

If you carefully read the description this wallet is &#34;faux leather&#34;, while other Sydney Bi Folds are 100% leather.  I bought this one because it was a color combo I liked, after having read the description of a different color that was 100% leather.  As soon as I pulled it out I knew by the smell and the feel. The zipper is metal and pull tab is leather.  The other Sydney is 100% leather, a plastic zipper and a FOSSIL stamped metal pull tab.  It also got me thinking about a different wallet I had recently purchased.  One Emory color combo was described &#34;lamb skin&#34; and it was a natural material.  The other Emory was &#34;100% Man Made Material&#34; and it did look, feel and smell different  Same price, different materials.  My advice, be VERY careful when reading the descriptions.  I know I will do so from this point forward.	2015-08-15

These shoes have Quality issues.   1st pair = one speedhook broke off the very first time I tried to loop a lace around it 2nd pair = left side has a crease, as if I stood on my tippy-toes for days with it on  I'm in a wheelchair, so standing on my tippy-toes I did not. Even if I had, I'd noticed the crease the second day, so I wore - mis-wore for argument's sake - for less than 10 hours... yet there's a permanent visible crease? No, sounds like cheap material/bad quality. Do not buy.  I'd exchange them if these were not my second pair and I was afraid of how bad the defect was with the third. Really saddening, being in a wheelchair I need little more than something to merely cover my feet, and chose these because they were the only highish-top shoes I liked the look of. Thought Columbia was a high grade brand, but personally I'm going to abstain from buying any of their products from now on.   **EDIT**: The 2 reviews before mine also mention quality issues - lol. Case closed.  **UPDATE**: After 7-10 uses, a different speedhook broke. RETURNING. DO NOT BUY.	2015-08-15

They ended up being just a tad big for my growing daughter, and since they were on sale, we decided to keep them for her. I just bought another pair a size bigger, so they should fit reasonably well when they arrive. The sale was even better the second time around! The sizing has been my only issue thus far. Hope they turn out to be as durable as I've heard.	2015-08-15

I wasn't blown away by the comfort initially but find that they wear very comfortably all day long and conform to your feet as you use them. They were a tad too large but snugging up the 3-way customizable straps make the fit work just right. Time and wear may earn them five stars, as the final proof of value will be in long days of traveling and exploring on foot.	2015-08-15

This product will make getting the new baseball glove ready to no in seemingly no time at all.  Yes, it can be used on all sorts of leather products.  I first came to know about this product as a kid, so many years ago, and have been using it ever since...I talking talking over 55 years.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR LIGHT COLORED LEATHERS.  This is an oil based leather product that will soften tough leather, but will leave light colored leather product looking noticeably darker.  After treatment your leather product will have the smell of the oil for a few days, but it will fade completely with time.  There's nothing like working the Neatfoot Oil into that new baseball glove and transforming into a well broken in glove seeming overnight.  I highly recommend Neatsfoot Oil for dark colored leather products.	2015-08-15

I have these in brown and got the black while I still could because they're the most comfortable shoes I own.

Now, however, they feel as though they were custom molded to my feet and offer great support for my bad back. They look better the more they're worn in. The leather inside does smell terrible, but it's only an issue when you take them off after a sweaty day (not noticeable while wearing them).	2015-08-15

She also likes how she can easily slip them on and off without asking for help.  The cotton interior lets the foot breath and decreases sweat.  Another great feature is the water resistant split-leather.  I believe my niece will enjoy them and will soon make them her favorite pair of shoes.

Between the thick leather and steel toes, they're quite heavy and sturdy. The full grain leather is about 3mm thick (thickness of a dime and a nickel on top of each other). I'm female, but wanted the steel toes, and Adtec only makes the steel toe version in men's. My feet are 26cm long (anywhere between US women's 8.5-10 depending on brands), so I got the smallest men's size they offer (men's 7.5). The boots are a little big - I probably needed men's size 7 if they offered it. However, they fit fine with extra thick sports socks.<br /><br />I thought the boots would be hard to take on/off since they don't have a side zipper. However, I just skip putting the shoelace through the top eyelets, and they're relatively easy to lace/unlace.<br /><br />The price is also good for the full grain leather, steel toe, Goodyear welt construction combo. A lot of the other boots I looked at with the same specs were in the $200-400 range.<br /><br />One minor thing to note: These boots are not exactly dainty. I think the manufacturer picture makes them look a little more sleek than they are. They aren't as heavy as construction/EMS boots, but they're a little chunkier than office boots. (I specifically got these steel toe boots for yard work - not office work, but was curious to see if they could do double duty. I feel they're a bit heavy for the office.)	2015-08-15

I have run in the Saucony Ride model for a couple of years now as a semi-serious competitive runner. It's a great shoe for those with a neutral gait who want an everyday trainer for all types of training runs. This shoe provides good support and cushioning without being overly bulky. I have found it to be a good shoe for all types of surfaces. In the past I bought this shoe at running stores, but I ordered it online this time so that I could try the narrow width, which is not often available in stores. I have a very narrow foot, and I find that my feet sometimes feel like they are swimming in standard-width shoes. The standard width of the Ride 6 is not especially wide compared to other models, but I just wanted to see if the narrow would work better for me, and it does! It hugs my foot better than the standard width, without being too tight or restrictive. I love the narrow version of this shoe, and this will be me go-to trainer from now on!	2015-08-15

The positive is that it's probably lighter than it would be if it was thicker fabric. The colors are bright and pretty, and the hardware isn't obnoxious. The TH branding blends in with the pattern. The front pocket is large enough - about 9&#34; wide, 1.5&#34; deep, and 6.5&#34; tall - to put a personal sized calendar, the cord for my tablet, and a pencil case in it. The main compartment has a flattened bottom and three, sewn-in, open-topped pockets. The three pocket aren't very big. The main, zipper closure leaves small - 1&#34; - gaps that might let small things fall out if the bag tips over. The shoulder straps are long enough that they allow my arm to bend and  fit through at the elbow. This means I don't have to lift it up and scoot it up my arm to my elbow. This will work well for bringing my planner and some grading materials to and from school. It's not a gigantic bag, so I won't be able to bring home as many things as a larger &#34;teacher bag&#34; or a backpack. This will work well for and it looks very pretty. It's cotton, so it might get dirty. I am worried about how durable this will be to get through the school year, but I purchased it more for looks than for functionality as a teacher bag.	2015-08-15

I like these new Vionic Tide II Orthotic Sandals better than their predecessor, which I loved.  These have even more arch support, which is critical if you've struggled with plantar fasciitis. Amazon's price is as low as I can find anywhere, so I order here.  My only problem - a good one - is not wearing the white ones absolutely everywhere. I'm a 10.5, and the 11 fits just fine. If you think you can't have arch support in an attractive sandal, you've got to give these a try.	2015-08-15

As other folks have mentioned, you really need to order a size smaller. I did this-and I find them to be too &#34;loose&#34;-they aren't a snug fit and I frequently roll my ankle since my foot can slide around in the footbed. I also find the material to be really hot which also makes them uncomfortable to wear. I will say that the footbed is extremely cushy and comfortable but overall I'm not satisfied with these shoes, especially for the money I spent on them. I rarely wear them because I'm worried I'll roll my ankle and I have you have kids I'm always carrying around. I really wanted to like them but I would be returning them if I hadn't waited too long.	2015-08-15

Beware - the one you get will probably be the later style which has a pocket that goes all the way to the edges in front and DOES NOT have the back zippered pocket.  I had my first one in navy with the shorter pocket and back zippered pocket features and really wanted that exact style again.  So I chose the photo of that one which had very limited colors.  Imagine my disappointment when after compromising on color to get the one with those features, I got the less desired style and in a color that's just okay.  Sigh.  Still preferable in size and features to the dozens I've looked at in stores and on line. Would still give it 5 stars for value especially since I know from experience that they are durable, but really annoyed that I got a different &#34;model&#34; than the one shown in the photo.	2015-08-15

I had a hard time finding a case that would fully close due to my frame size.  This case is very lightweight but extremely sturdy.  The magnetic closure works really well and I don't have to worry that my frames will fall out.  I don't like the big, bulky cases that take up a lot of room and weigh a ton in my purse or backpack.<br /><br />My first case lasted about 4+ years.  I'm sure it would still be working just fine except I accidentally stepped on it trying to get out of the way of an over enthusiastic dog. (My purse was on the ground beside me.)  Thankfully, my prescription glasses were undamaged but the case was bent and no longer closed all the way.  I was relieved this style of case is still being manufactured and offered for sale at Amazon.<br /><br />This is my 2nd case (in this exact style) and I will purchase another one when this wears out.  Great color options too.  My first case was turquoise.	2015-08-15

Vasques notoriously run small, so if you cannot get to a store to try them on before ordering them, try going up a size. I've had my first pair of Vasque boots, same everything just the old model of this boot, for 10 years, and even then they only got hurt because  someone pushed them too close to the fire to dry out one day after a cross river trip and they got a little burnt and heat warped. I have not found a boot that better fits my foot and is made from such quality. These things will last forever! Word to the wise though: there is no fit-all boot, and though it may be a great boot for some, it won't fit other's feet well. That doesn't make it a bad boot, it just means it's not for you.	2015-08-15

I like the black ones, but the leather is stiffer than the brown leather, which was incredibly soft from the beginning.  The fit is also slightly different, possibly because of the stiffer leather.  The soles are very comfortable for walking.  I wear the sandals with shorts and dressy casual slacks.	2015-08-15

It's great to have a pair of shoes you can just wear when you go to the beach or whatever.

I was a bit surprised at how stiff the arch is on this insole.  I tried it right away in my shoes and was surprised again, but this time my surprise was that the arch felt pretty good.  I do wish the cushioning on top was thicker and softer over the entire length of the insole since that was my reason for purchasing these in the first place.  I have found it really difficult to find an insole that provides both arch and general support plus a good amount of cushioning.  As I've aged, I find that my feet get bonier and bonier with virtually no cushioning under my heel and metatarsal area.  This now causes my feet to get sore like never before.  It's irritating and as of now I've not found a solution in an insole that eliminates the pain and soreness I get after being on my feet for several hours.  I decided that I'll just wear these insoles and 'customize'  them that way rather than heating them up in the oven. Maybe once they've molded to my feet they will feel a little better.  But still, guess I'll just keep looking.	2015-08-15

Ive had this brand before, they hold up fairly well.  Why they put a cloth on the sole is beyond me, it wears off exposing the rubber like material.  They wear fine except for the cloth covering on the sole, which doesn't seem to affect anything.  Would recommend if you are looking for a comfortable easy to wear house slipper.	2015-08-15

Now after a few months I am happy I went a half size down and the boots are broken in nicely. The boots are very tough and will definitely last a long time. Danner will recraft these by putting on a a new sole if I ever choose to do so.	2015-08-15

My first through fourth pair were so wonderful that I couldn't express it enough to every woman I knew....women of all ages at that. But someone somewhere also wrote a review stating how they've done something different, and they're right. These shoes unfortunately are not what they used to be. I don't know why Easy Spirit started skimping on the materials. The wonderful cushy insert is no longer there and what's really strange is the left shoe doesn't fit the way they did before. It's as if their pattern or machines have changed. So disappointing! I bought two pair now and have to (hopefully) return them for a refund. They're stiff now too which is something another person described them as. Now I don't know what to buy or where to start. I have a bad back and the previous Punters never caused me pain. Now I can't wear them at all.	2015-08-15

A friend bought a pair of these and let me try them and I was blown away and immediately had to buy a pair for myself. I've never had polarized lenses before, but now that I have, I don't think I'll ever buy non-polarized sunglasses again. The polarized lenses block reflected light and reduce glare and just give you a crisp clear view. They fit snuggly and I don't have to keep pushing them up like I have had to do with other sunglasses in the past. Also, the wrap around style is great and keeps light from coming in the sides. Very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend!	2015-08-15

This isn't going to be best review because I wore these things for a total of 4 hours.  That is not long enough to really tell if they're comfortable, what kind of terrain they can take, how long they last, etc.  (In general, Amazon reviews suffer from this problem because Amazon asks for reviews soon after your product arrives, but some products take 2–3 months to really get to know.)  This pair of shoes get a review after those four hours, though, because one of the suede (I had to go back to the product description to see just what they were made of) eyelets holding the laces broke during only the second time I tried to tie them.  I guess it was too much pressure or something.  It snapped right in the middle of the piece of suede, not on a seam or some place you'd expect something like that to happen.  Anyway, while it doesn't render the shoe totally useless, it's close.  Hiking shoes are ones I like to have fit snugly and firmly, especially up by my ankle.  It might just be this pair, and others will have better luck, but I'm not going to test my luck.  I'll be buying something else for shoes.	2015-08-15

The cross-body strap works well. It's a little mushy for my tastes but usable pockets everywhere. The beads on the purse are not held together by anything but the pressure of the leather pushing against the plastic. One fell off within a couple hours of use. I got a tiny refund for the missing bead and no ability to replace it. I just question the quality or why they didn't use an adhesive of any kind for this. Everything else is holding up fine, but I would never buy another person from Scarleton if it has any sort of bead or metal feature like this.	2015-08-15

I purchased the black and purple color sandals and I love the comfort because of my plantar fasciitis.  I have been wearing them for a couple of months and mostly outside, but did get some sarcastic comments from friends because of the loud squeak coming from them.  Now I am back at work preparing for school and will probably be throwing them away because the squeak is definitely too loud for indoors.  I hope that is not the case for all people who purchased them.  I am bummed that I won't have the comfort of them for now or next summer.	2015-08-15

I should preface this review by explaining that I work 8-10 hour shifts 5 days a week in a busy seafood restaurant.  I juggle orders between a flat-top, three deep fryers, and your run of the mill refrigerated line.  That being said, I'm not entirely sure that these shoes were made for my type of work, I think they are more for stylish city bistros where the work is light and you're not afraid to wear stylish clothes being a cook.<br /><br />On to my review.  I bought these with my first paycheck, 90 bucks was a bit steep, but I figured if I put up a bit of scratch I'd get a quality shoe that would last me a while.  The first week wearing them was great, I received lots of compliments/jealous comments about how stylish the shoes were.  I felt like I was walking on marshmallows, I thought I'd found some sort of holy grail of the restaurant industry: the perfect shoe.  Second week?  Not so much.  My feet started getting that familiar burning tired feeling.. I blamed everything but my shoes.  It just kept going downhill from there.  The &#34;slip-resistant&#34; sole stopped working nine days after buying them.  By the third week, I was tempted to just switch back to my old shoes.. but I'd spent 90 bucks on these bad boys, I couldn't justify spending 90 bucks on something that only lasted me three weeks.  So I went out and got some Dr. Scholl inserts.. it made it a bit better, manageable.<br /><br />I'm in my 2nd month of owning these shoes and I'm sick of them, they're utter trash.  The slip-resistant soles stopped working long ago.  I have to clean them on my days off because they literally soak up ANYTHING that hits them.  The canvas acts as a sponge that reeks at the end of the day.<br /><br />I've included pictures of these shoes that I took after a month and a half of owning them.  The mess on the top of the shoe is after four days of work.  The worn through patch on the heel is proof that the arch support on these shoes are non-existent.<br /><br />I have owned these shoes 2 months and I'm already replacing them.  90 dollars for two months of use.  What a waste.	2015-08-15

As an elementary school teacher with fallen arches, when I find a shoe that is both comfortable and stylish, I feel like I've hit the jackpot. These shoes were both, except for the heel. Even though I ordered them in a narrow, they were too long and the heel kept going up and down. I tried purchasing heel pads from a shoe store, but it didn't help. Finally, I returned them and ordered one size down (again in narrow) and those fit better. They feel a little snug, particularly across the front of the foot, but I'm hoping wearing them around the house will let the leather stretch so they're more comfortable. If these start to hurt, then I'll be returning the smaller pair too. I really like these, so I hope they work.	2015-08-15

By the end of the day the balls of my feet were a little sore. The toe box area is tapered to an odd point and very narrow, and the rest of the shoe/strap area is a little wider than I expected, but I have very narrow feet. My big toe sometimes is slightly over the edge of the shoe SIDE (not end) because of the tapering, but it's not uncomfortable at all. The little fabric &#34;tongue&#34; on the top of the shoe sticks down into my toes and rubbed a bit when I first had the smaller size, but I exchanged it for a larger size and now it doesn't rub uncomfortably. I usually wear size 9, but got a 9.5 in these. Glad I did.	2015-08-15

I must be getting old as I have graduated from cute minimal sandals to needing shoes with arch support if I want to walk around all day without dying. These provide nice support without looking as aggressively athletic as the other options I found. Also, the strap between my toes doesn't start to chafe like cheap flip-flops do. My last pair (identical except for the strap decoration) lasted for two and a half summers of constant wear before the fabric on the foot bed started to fray - they were still structurally sound but it really tickled the bottom of my feet so I replaced them. I know that doesn't sound terribly long-lasting but I'm happy to pay less than $25 for happy feet all summer - I wear them literally every day.	2015-08-15

I have several purses and bags made by Frye in different styles, and I am very pleased with the quality of the leather as well as the construction (I was a bit concerned when I learned that many items are now made in China, but everything I have purchased has been top-notch). I ordered this bag last fall when it went on sale, and have been using it quite a bit--I find the size to be just right. Lots of compartments, but it is a bit smaller than I pictured (even though the dimensions were included in the description; I guess it just has to be seen in person). I was originally thinking of getting the smaller version because I don't really carry a lot of stuff around with me and I was worried this one would be huge...luckily the reviews were helpful in this regard and I am very glad that I ordered this one--I imagine it is a bit too big for a minimalist (keys, comb, small wallet; I used to be one, not anymore) but too small for someone who is used to carrying a full tote-sized bag. I can fit my keys, glasses, a small cosmetics bag, wallet and phone and there is room for a few small odds and ends, but that is about it...I'm sure the smaller one would have been much too small. It is lovely as well as practical, and I have had no problems with it at all (it has been almost a year). I touch up the leather every couple of months with a light application of Leather Honey to protect it and it still looks brand new.  I bought the Cognac and the color is just gorgeous. I will definitely purchase other items from Frye--I think they are terrific, although I find the regular retail prices a bit high for my budget, but I am willing to wait for a discount (and then I feel I just can't go wrong!)	2015-08-15

These shoes look great, are made well and fit the foot lengthwise perfectly. Unfortunately they are extremely uncomfortable because the high quality leather is so stiff that the construction at the heel causes painful blisters in no time due to slippage.

It works wonders and if i apply some to both my heel and the inside of the sandal, voila no slippage and therefore no pain! I will wear thwm, but i doubt Id get them again...	2015-08-15

I was hoping for something like the vapor glove, but a bit more to it so I could go for longer runs without foot pain. I still wanted the natural feel with a few millimeters of padding. Unfortunately, it didn't like up to my hopes. I wouldn't call these shoes minimalist, to start with. The rubber sole under the arch is way too stiff to allow for a natural feel. What was very unexpected, especially for such a respected name in footwear, was the poor build quality. The shoes looked great on the outside, but inside the fabric was coming loose after one run. They have since been returned.	2015-08-15

As a college student with major bunion and arch problems (mine are VERY severe for my age), it's almost impossible for me to find shoes that are comfortable, supportive, and stylish for my age. I also have size 10W feet, which adds to the problem.<br /><br />And then I found these shoes! What a difference! I don't even feel like I'm wearing shoes - I could wear them all day. I actually hate taking them off at the end of the day. They are perfect to wear with many different outfits, and the color I got (Bronze) looks nice with almost anything. The heel is also a perfect size, giving just a little lift. The shoes make my feet look nice and normal for once. I feel so confident when I'm wearing them. It's amazing what difference good shoes can make to your attitude. I really recommend them for anyone. I will probably buy more colors in the future. I'm so glad I found these!	2015-08-15

I did a lot of research and like anything else, I found plenty of people who said they ran small, big, narrow, and everything in between. Most people did say say they ran true to size so I ordered my normal size (10 1/2) and they fit great! They did feel a little narrow at first but after a couple hours the first day they broke in a bit and felt fine after that. That's just my 2 cents for anyone concerned about sizing. As for the shoe itsself, I love it. Black and white with gum bottoms, can't go wrong. Pretty much goes with anything. If they weren't so expensive I'd order another pair just to leave in the closet until these burn out. With as many styles of air max nike pushes out, who knows how long these will be around so get them while you can.	2015-08-15

Better than average arch support for a water shoe but not like the overpriced ones. I have worn mine all summer at the water park and they are holding up great. I can even wear them around the outside of the water comfortably. They are really comfortable, I don't feel every rock under foot, my feet aren't weighted down when filled with water. they do not stretch as the day goes on. They fit to your actual shoe size, so getting a half size small would be a mistake. So far they have never slid off. They kind of hug your stay on your feet really weel even when wet so there is no need for the drawstrings, zippers, or anthing else to hold them onto your foot. Lots of comments on them, they are really cute. I will probably get another pair in another color next year as long as they are under $35. Even if I don't buy another pair, these will hold of just fine for another season or two.	2015-08-15

If not, this one is great, especially like the zippered top.  My friend loved the multi-colored heart design, which will match the multitude of shoulder bags she will use this with.	2015-08-15

At the same time, they're great when you get in the water because they're extremely lightweight and there are small holes for drainage all over (including the bottom). They took a bit of getting used to in the water, as the soles are slightly buoyant. It's not hard to keep your feet at the bottom, but they do have a slight tendency to want to float upwards.<br /><br />In terms of sizing, I would say I wear a size 9 roughly 70% of the time, and an 8.5 the other 30% of the time. In these shoes, an 8.5 was perfect. I was worried because 8.5 is all they had in stock when I ordered, and some people said they run small. I even ordered a backup pair of water shoes from another brand. Luckily, though, the 8.5 fit and I'm very happy with the purchase. They have a style similar to much more expensive water shoes, yet they're very reasonably priced.	2015-08-15

These Rocky MensBlizzard Stalker Pro Hunting boots are excellent for me.  They are aesthetically appealing for a winter boot.  I have a difficult time finding the right shoes/boots that are comfortable so I was relieved when I put them on and found them to be comfortable for me.  After a few months of wear and tear in chilly environments on different types of terrain they have held up and maintained their comfort.  I have found the Stalker Pro to keep my feet warm in some pretty cool temperatures i.e up to -10F.  Keep in mind, in milder temperatures, lets say +30F and above, these boots WILL be very warm and may cause your feet to sweat.  With Proper &#34;wicking&#34; socks and you should be alright.  The waterproofing is still holding up as are the shoe laces.  As a new purchase, these are a stiff and &#34;clunky&#34; (large) boot but over time, they will soften up.  The clunky-ness....well....that pretty much doesn't change but you get used to it.  To date, these have been great boots for cold temperatures while working outside and of course, walking in the woods.  A final note.....when standing/sitting still for a while quite commonly expedites the chilling, freezing, coldness to one's feet.  These boots have kept mine warm.	2015-08-15

I played a Warrior with the Brawler spell set and it rocked. I love playing heavy warriors with massive armor and huge weapons, and this game delivered.<br /><br />The graphics are great. The monsters and opponents are nicely detailed and terrific. I liked the atmosphere of the whole game world. The world is not the biggest, but there are many locked doors and passageways to be discovered.<br /><br />The music is awesome! I especially LOVE the track for the credits - listening to it play now! The whole game has great sound. Metal on metal, soft boots are different from metal boots when you move. wow. Again, the music track is one of the best EVER in a game.<br /><br />Play - wow. Just stunning. I've played Demon's Souls and both Dark Souls games. This game is fantastic! Fighting is so much fun. Armored opponents dueling it out. Almost all of the enemies can be fought toe to toe. For those that can't, magic worked really well for a warrior in this game. There are several healing methods and all are useful.<br /><br />The battle moves are - just wow - fantastic as each weapon has its own move set. Big weapons, small weapons, your every dream for medieval fighting come true. I used several weapons and shields, my favorites, of course, are the BIG weapons. I tried many of them and was total fun. Enemies are varied and monsters are great to fight. The armors are terrific. I can't say enough good things about this game! One of the best games ever.<br /><br />Magic is very useful as well. There are three different schools of magic with four spells and 3 levels of spell each. Very nice!<br /><br />My first play through took 39 hours 33 minutes. I did grind a little, and it was fun - every second! I was not able to get all treasure chests on my first play through the game, but I did manage quite a bit of the trophies. Nice! Oh, and the DLC was very good as well!<br /><br />I read where they are making Lords of The Fallen 2 for 2017. Can't wait!<br /><br />Lords of the Fallen is what Bloodborne is not - a toe to toe, knock down drag out brawler of a game. Yeah, I died many times, but I won many battles! The whole world is very cool to explore. Castles, evil areas, neat. The story was just enough to keep things going. I do not need a strong story, just a reason to be there and fight the good - or bad! - fight. This is an exceptional game and a half!Lords of the Fallen is what Bloodborne is not - a toe to toe, knock down drag out brawler of a game. Yeah, I died many times, but I won many battles!

The game designers tried to create something over the top but failed to even bother with a decent AI or a multiplayer mode. Hard to believe this game has a sequel in the making considering how the poor game mechanics are. The vehicle driving is wretched and  that's using a nice word to describe it. Probably the biggest mistake here is getting Square Enix involved ........... one of the worst in the gaming industry. I have yet to find a game that they are connected to that I like. Just Cause 2 is no exception. Just a lazy effort with too many repetitive things to do. There are over 300 locations but it looks like they came up with maybe 10 different layouts and copied it until they got tired at 300.  I would also advise anyone playing to just set it at the highest difficulty. No matter what difficulty you play at it will ultimately increase in difficulty. Play it and you will notice this. Not an overly difficult game but you can spend days playing it ........... but it suffers from a poor AI, weak (and short campaign), and its WAY too repetitive.	2015-08-15

A bit repetitive in terms of attacks and close-quarter combinations, but nonetheless a very worthy storyline. In fact, there are alot of hints - that you can connect our current society too the storyline - in the storyline it's not even funny.<br /><br />- Corrupt Corporations engaging in corporatocracy & socioeconomic warfare.<br /><br />- Private Contractors and Mercenaries representing special interests for certain corporations<br /><br />- Corrupt Law Enforcement abusing the various scopes of Martial Law<br /><br />- Corporate bureaucracy and the &#34;red tape&#34; that follows<br /><br />Again, this game to me is worth playing and investing. Maybe not so much for graphics like: The Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, or games like Far Cry 4, the game is worth trying out. And if you're a conspiracy nut --aka- someone whose NOT a sheep in society. You'll put two and two together and wonder &#34;if the game creators were trying to warn us&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;You never change things by fighting the existing reality.

This is basically a tower-defense game with iconic cartoon characters.  You set up various kinds of defenses around the board (and there are a number of different boards), then try to keep waves of enemies from destroying your toy box.  You can take control of any of your emplacements at any time, and you can use heroes to do serious damage to enemies.  The overall concept is fresh, as it is not simply a tower-defense game, but something more.<br /><br />The one thing that keeps this from being a five-star game for me is the pay-to-upgrade option.  You can buy tokens to upgrade your soldiers, emplacements, etc.  I know that this makes extra money for developers, but I am not a fan of pay-to-win gaming.  Your mileage may vary and you might well find that this is a point that you like about the game, so this is simply my opinion.<br /><br />This edition comes with all the characters available, unlike the downloadable version where you have to buy a separate pack of characters.  The character pack is included as a code inside the box.	2015-08-15

Can't imagine why.) so this was a good fit for getting back into the game so to speak. It's decent, probably good for newcomers, but for hardcore gamers, might want to give it a pass. I haven't really gotten into the guts of the game (that toddler thing, tends to suck up most of my time), look forward to exploring though. On the plus side, I'm 1-1 vs. the Patriots with my Cardinals. Hint: don't try to run up the gut against Wilfork. Also, throw to anyone but Fitz, he's usually double covered. Floyd can't make the catches, but if it's third and long, he's usually clutch.	2015-08-15

As an old school RPGer, and an off-line player only, there did not seem to be many PS4 titles that were of interest to me. Witcher 3 was thee exception, as I enjoyed Witcher 2 immensely. I was blown away by the detail of this game, as well as the immense world to explore. The side-quests were actually more fun than the main quest, which I found rather disappointing. Each side quest had it's own little story to tell, and the quests were quite varied and well constructed. On the down side, there are still a couple of game breaking glitches that have not been corrected. An infinite loading screen, and a glitch that does not let you use your signs. After looking online, my only way to correct these glitches, was to backtrack to earlier saves. But, for a game this vast and fun to play, I suppose a glitch or two one can put up with. I highly recommend this game. I put in 147 hours on it, and came to the  end at level 36. This is one game where you get your moneys worth!	2015-08-15

It's ok for the money.  On fighting games the responsiveness sucks.  Anyone who plays Street Fighter games from 90s can tell you that responsiveness is critical.

First of all, i don't really write any review if i don't like the product. But this charging station is well worth for that. I have received it today after a standard shipping which took only 1.5 day.<br /><br />The stand just perfectly designed for both PS4 system and DS4 controllers. Only thing, u have to take a sneak peak from the bottom of the controller for its front led to see whether it is charging which is not that big deal. The fans get the job well done with providing extra air circulation for PS4. It has 4 USB 3.0 outputs in the front of the device which you can connect up to 4 extra devices to charge besides the DS4 charging docks on the stand.<br /><br />Overall; this is an excellent stand for the price, considering Sony's original vertical stand being about 30 bucks with no other features what so ever.<br />Strongly recommended and definitely will buy more from the same brand	2015-08-15

Mad Catz TE line has never been perfect in the past but I kept hopes high that in 2015 they might want to take things more seriously to stay ahead of the competition! I'm talking about the finishing! The sticks body is made of several plastic components which just don't fit together perfectly! Sharp corners and gaps especially in front of the stick and near the side panels! I own older TE sticks with similar problems but not as bad as on this newer release! It just looks cheap and unprofessional! Almost like a knock off product!<br />Too many people buy their arcade sticks blindly and Mad Catz knows that so they give a shit!(?)<br />It's a beautiful design and it works otherwise great as expected as on any other arcade stick equipped with Sanwa parts!<br />If you can forgive a poor quality finish (casing) and just needed another chance to have a TE-S for a reasonable price, go for it! It otherwise plays as good as any other tournament stick!	2015-08-15

Cons:<br />*Music doesn't really stand out as memorable, but it also shouldn't send you running for the mute button.<br />*You can only own one house at a time instead of collecting them. I guess since they're all owned by the same landlord, it would be silly to buy all of her properties & own multiple houses in the same town, but that doesn't prevent you from wanting to.<br />*You can only have 2 traveling companions, so if you bought 3 pets, you'd have to leave one at home.<br />*You can't have any traveling companions during story adventures, nor can you buy the mansion until you've completed the story.<br />*Some JRPG fans will be disappointed by the lack of marriage system.<br />*There is DLC. The kind that unlocks whole areas & covers both companion friendship points & companion leveling.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Lots of replay value, since you can switch between a wide variety of jobs. You can't do all the the quests with just one job.<br />*It's like a nice cross between a fantasy RPG & Harvest Moon, so Rune Factory fans will love it.<br />*Great character customization, plus you can collect & mix-match outfits instead of being stuck with a job uniform day in & day out.<br />*You can own 3 pets, you can make them travel with you, you can even make the sword slinging tomboy princess or her equally kickass mom your companions much latter in the game.<br />*You could play it casually, but you're far more likely to sink hours away into it. I even lost sleep over it.<br />*Gorgeous world, especially the tropical area.<br />*The mobs that come out at night are often different from the ones you see during the day. Also not a lot of reskinned character models, so the monsters are more unique per area.<br />*The characters are quite amusing, making for a more interesting story. Your sidekick is a sassy talking butterfly.<br /><br />Note: There is an Android/iPhone game called Fantasy Life 2. It's little more than an upgraded port of this game with the same characters &story, so you really shouldn't accidently buy both. If you happen to own an iPad or Android based tablet & want to play on a larger screen, then you may want 2 instead.	2015-08-15

The Golf Club caught my eye the moment I saw visuals for it prior to release, and I wanted it immediately. So when I got my PS4 in June I decided this would be the first game I bought myself as I am both a fan of the sport as well as a fan of the classic Tiger Woods games. I got this hoping it would be a new gen title that could stand up among the greats of golf gaming...<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />For the sake of brevity, I'll simply break this into pros and con's and avoid the extra stuff I could ramble about.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The atmosphere of this game is so amazingly calm. It perfectly captures the essence of real golf and will immediately relax you. This makes it the perfect game to unwind with after a stressful day. Beautiful scenery, the peaceful sounds, the pacing of the game, and even the pleasant announcer who feels more like a friend than someone calling a game for you.<br /><br />-The gameplay. If you're familiar with the Tiger Woods games (I'm referring specifically to '04-'08 as those are the only ones I've played), then these controls will come naturally. You pick your club, you set your aim, and you pull the stick back then push it forward to swing. Keep it straight or it'll slice. Simple mechanics, and a very natural feeling swing setup that somehow feels even better than the Tiger Woods setup despite their blatant simillarities. One thing I like that's different here is that you cannot put spin on your shot AFTER the swing as in Tiger Woods. Here it's all about simulation, and the realism approach requires spin and loft be adjusted PRIOR to the actual swing. Finally the putting mechanism is much more authentic than the Tiger Woods games, and while it is more difficult, it is also much more enjoyable.<br /><br />-The authentic feel. As I mentioned earlier, this game just feels more like the real deal than Tiger Woods games ever did, because despite being the great games they were, EA always leaned quite obviously toward the arcade side of things with Tiger Woods titles in order to appeal to a wider crowd: The Golf Club does not do this. This game knows what it is, and it not only accepts that, it embraces it. The Golf Club is simply golf, and it tries only to please straight up golf enthusiasts, and I must say it does so very well. This game hits all of the right notes for a true golf fan.<br /><br />-Golf Course creator. A feature that adds literally infinite amounts of depth is the golf course creator. This alone could keep you busy for years to come, but add to it the ability to share your courses with friends and you have a truly great mechanic.<br /><br />-Course rating. Honestly only a minor plus, the course rating system is still a nice touch that shows us that HB Studios was trying to give us everything they could think of that we might want. We need more companies doing this. The game shows itself a labor of love and not a mere attempt to make money (though obviously all games are made in hopes of financial gain).<br /><br />CONS:<br />-There is less customization than I'd like to see outside of the Golf Course creator. Still the course creator is more than enough to make up for this.<br /><br />Yeah...that's all of the cons I can think of. This game is a gem: it's that simple. I love it, and I am certain all those looking for an authentic golf experience in a game will love it as well. This is just a solid game overall, more than deserving of a five star rating. I will certainly be on the lookout for another game made by these guys.<br /><br />Long story short: I highly recommend this game.arcade side of things with Tiger Woods titles in order to appeal to a wider crowd: The Golf Club does not do this.

Overall if you are looking for that old school arcade feel this is a really good arcade stick. It's also good if you happen to be a competitor for games like old school SF or Tatsunoko vs Capcom tournaments etc. Well here's a few details.<br /><br />- Buttons feel a little stiff but are good quality close to Sanwa buttons but more like Hori in my opinion<br />- Compartment can hold a Wii Remote as well as the cable for completely wireless setup.<br />- Joystick has very nice feel and definitive control. Octagonal gate type.<br />- Plenty of comfortable vertical space for arms. Lessens Fatigue<br />- No turbo function. Can be a negative depending on preference.<br />- Somewhat customizable. Changeable artwork (not sure what else)<br />- Easy to set up and use<br />- Joystick is automatically read as the DPad so control stick dependent games are unplayable with this.<br />- Perfect for any and all old school games and virtual console titles.<br /><br />Overall I give the stick a 4 out of 5. Considering it's third party and the overall quality of the product it certainly beats out some of the other options out there. It's not going to exceed a Hori or a MadCatz arcade stick however, it serves its purpose and is well worth the price. If you are on a budget for your Wii/Wii U Fighting and Arcade game needs look no further!<br />-	2015-08-15

It plays like a shooter and has group runs comparable to an MMO's dungeons and a few &#34;raids&#34; that I never experienced.<br /><br />Could be superb if you have friends with the same game but the raids are oddly enough the 1 part of the game that lacks matchmaking.  I'm a Playstation/PC gamer while most of my console friends are Xbox fan boys and I don't feel this game has the social atmosphere to find/make friends in.	2015-08-15

Lore: This is technically Golden Sun 3, with the first 2 games being on the Gameboy Advance. Knowing a lot of people would be going into this game having not played the first 2, they decided to make the children of the previous games' heroes the focus, & include books, an encyclopedia of terms, & a very long opening cutscene that explains the events of the first two games. Unfortunately, &#34;show&#34; works better than &#34;tell&#34; & you might as well just play ROMs of the first two games if you really want to know what the heck is going on. The collectible books do a much better job of filling you in than all of the NPC exposition combined.<br /><br />Getting lost: The game explains nothing to you after the parents leave, so you'll find yourself going to Walkthrough frequently. The Walkthroughs skip a lot of important things like &#34;ignore this for now, you'll be coming back to it latter&#34; so you may find yourself needing youtube walkthroughs for certain parts. You will also find that you can get cut off from returning to areas entirely, meaning any Djinns & boxed you failed to figure out how to get to will be permanently lost to you.<br /><br />The puzzles: The puzzles will keep your brain intrigued when the Random Encounter battles start to wear on your patience. They're quite fun, but when it comes to areas you are unaware that you are supposed to skip for now & come back to latter (like the Harapa Ruins), you will be stumped & frustrated, because you're not supposed to solve it yet & therefore can't.<br /><br />The graphics: Reminds me greatly of Final Fantasy 9. If you've never played that, think FF7 without the hideous Popeye arms. Looks good even on a tiny 2DS screen.<br /><br />The dialogue: You cannot really make it faster & it scrolls quite slowly. It also makes a very irritating noise that you can thankfully turn off. Words highlighted in red will bring up the dictionary, which is useful for short attention spans or long breaks between the game.<br /><br />The cast: Despite being called the Leader, Matthew is really more of a mute observer & battle support who communicates with a limited range of emotions. The true leader is Karis; the smart one, the one who makes the first move in battle, & Team Mom of the group. Tyrell is comical lackey. He's less strong than Matthew, bullheaded, clumsy, & irresponsible. He & Karis don't get along, so Matthew is the glue that bonds them together. Latter in the early part of the game, the group is completed when Rief joins the team. He's the team's Glass Canon & Loremaster, giving the party two smart mature magic users & 2 bumbling manchild warriors.	2015-08-15

Far Cry 4 proves to be nothing more than taking what Far Cry 3 did, changing the story, and enhancing the multiplayer features. But is this a bad thing? The answer there is no. Far Cry 3 proved to be one of my favorite games of all time. The massive open world, the large arsenal of guns (including super powerful signature weapons), the optional side quests, the depth of the characters, and the wonderful story are what made Far Cry 3 the 10/10 game that it was. Far Cry 4 takes all of that and adds to it.<br /><br />Story 9/10:<br />The game opens with the main protagonist, Ajay Ghale, headed to Kyrat, a fictional country in the Himalayas, to fulfill his dead mother's final wish, spreading her ashes. Things take a turn for the worst when he is kidnapped by our villain, Pagan Min. Ajay finds himself in the middle of a civil war between the Golden Path and the Pagan's Royal Army. Throughout the game you capture bell towers and outposts to unlock side quests, extra loot, weapons, and fast travel locations. Capturing these towers and outposts are optional but provide you with free weapons and the ability to purchase signature weapons. These signature weapons are my favorite parts of the game. Weapons such as the Buzzsaw, the AMR, and the Shredder allow you to tear through the opposition with ease. My only complaint with the story is that we did not get to choose the side of Pagan Min. I love fighting for the Golden Path but with how Pagan Min treats you I would've loved to be able to fight with him.<br /><br />Multiplayer/Co-op 8/10:<br />There are two options for Multiplayer in Far Cry 4: Campaign Co-op and Chronicles. Chronicles gives us three modes: Battles of Kyrat, Map Browser, and Map Editor. Battles of Kyrat is your standard FPS multiplayer. You can select from 4 game modes (5 if you have dlc). It's your standard 5v5 multiplayer with nothing too special. The real fun in Chronicles comes from the Map Editor. You get to create your own map choosing from 5 terrain types. It's your standard map editor allowing you to place in several objects, AIs, weapons, and vehicles. It's a lot of fun to create and play your own maps. My one complaint with Far Cry 3 was the way they handled co-op. Only giving us a few missions that really weren't fun at all. Far Cry 4 makes up for this big time. You can join another player's game or have them join your game. The second player of the game plays as Hurk and you can do anything in the campaign excluding main story missions. All side missions, bell towers, outposts, loot chests, and extra items can be collected on co-op. This provides for hours of fun. My only complaints with the co-op are that you can't do story missions together, both players are forced to fast travel together, and if two players stray from each other one is teleported to the other.<br /><br />Far Cry 4 is a must buy for any gamer who enjoys any aspect of First Person Shooters or Role-Playing Games. If you played Far Cry 3 and enjoyed it, you will certainly enjoy this game as well.es. It's your standard map editor allowing you to place in several objects, AIs, weapons, and vehicles.

I'm a fighting games player and as a travel headset or just one for when I'm practicing combos this does quite nicely. Sound quality is beautiful and blocks out outside noise. It is stereo though so take that at face value. The mic quality is pretty good and clear. The tags on the ear cups are removable and customizable as well.<br /><br />Only problem i really see is in the actual ear cups themselves. They are kind of small so for people with more average or large ears these will become uncomfortable during extended play sessions. So use them within reasonable limits. You can adjust the headset to make it more manageable but if you can afford it get a different pair of Tritons with larger ear cups like the Pro's for example.Other than that I can't complain. Easy to use for music, gaming or anything you may have intended for them Worth the price	2015-08-15

I have owned and played Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2.  This has some of the same feel as those but is sufficiently different to be its own stand alone game.  The key critical carry over is death.  This game makes you think before acting because if you don't, there can be consequences.  Thus, it's not one of those mindless run 'n gun games (which can be fun in  a more limited way).<br /><br />For those of you not very familiar with the Souls games, this is essentially a one player game with outside help.  Basically, other players leave messages that help guide us through this vast world.  For tough parts, you can summon random players to come to your aid and you can battle tough enemies with one or two helpers.  It's open world and there is no map - so you can go where you want when you want.  If you find that an area is overly challenging, that's usually a sign to try a different area.<br /><br />This games maintains its playability, as do the other Souls games.  There are weapons/items that you can't even obtain until your second run-through.  Sometimes your interaction with an NPC (computer player) doesn't go well and you start thinking, &#34;Ok, I won't do that the next time through&#34;.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you have never played the Souls games you can start with this one and really enjoy it.  And if you do, you ought to then go back and play the others.  If you have played the Souls games then this is obviously in your wheelhouse and you should very much enjoy it.	2015-08-15

There are no ladders to climb and he can't even get on top of a house. This isn't realistic, if there was a zombie apocalypse, of course people would be firing from far away.<br /><br />On the plus side, there are lots of swastikas and even Hitler himself. So this does feel like you're fighting actual Nazis.	2015-08-15

Most of the bad reviews date back to the pay to play period. Online play is now free with a Live Gold account. As for glitches, I have played for more than 100 hours and the only glitches that I encounter on an ongoing basis are difficulty accessing the guild bank and being dropped from the game once in a while.  Annoying but not enough to put me off playing.  The game is beautiful and has quests all over Tamriel.  At first, you are restricted to your alliance's part of the map but once your character becomes a vet, you can go anywhere.  If you create multiple characters on the same account, items can be shared between them through the banking system.  Everything from mount speed to blacksmithing skills is upgradable.  The leveling system is great because it levels the skills you use.  So much fun, I was hooked immediately.  My one complaint is that there is no inter-alliance play.  You can only group with players who have characters in your alliance.  Once a character becomes a vet, I wish they would add an area where we can quest with friends who have characters in different alliances.  This is my first MMO so I can't say it's a must have for MMO fans but it is definitely a must have for ES fans. Amazing addition to the series.	2015-08-15

One of the wire wasn't even in a plastic bag. The game that came with seemed like it was rewrapped. The system also gets hot very very fast.

It is a very fun adventure game that is perfect to play with friends. However, if your trying to get 100% completion, than its best to do so by yourself. Your friends may obstruct your view or make it more difficult. Especially since the camera is a bit wobbly on open landscapes than a simple side scrolling view. Its a perfect game with high replay value though once you played everything it has to offer once than there's not much to look forward or go back too. However, its still a great game regardless.<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Its a Mario game. There is no plot. Instead of Princess Peach getting taken away, its the Pixie Princesses of the Sprixie Kingdom.<br /><br />Characters:<br /><br />Play as the Mushroom trio as Mario, Peach, Luigi and Toad. Each one has their own special ability. Mario is not too fast or slow, Peach is slow but can float for a short while (which is a life saver on some courses), Luigi has slippery traction but the highest jump, and Toad is the fastest despite having poor jumping abilities. You also have Rosalina but<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />Plays like any other Mario game but with new power ups. The Cat Suit allows you to climb walls and swipe at enemies. Tanooki makes a return along with Golden Tanooki which makes you invincible. There is also the Double Cherry that makes clones of yourself! The bosses are taken up a notch and the worlds feature something of a new gimmick. Favorite being the shadow areas where everything is a silhouette. There's the mystery houses where you have a certain number of time to clear the area and get the green star, the Toad Adventures where you guide Toad to gain all 10 green stars around a puzzle area, and the three bonus worlds which are unlocked after the main game is completed. They are difficult and challenging if your up for it.<br /><br />The music is amazing and different than the typical Mario music and the HD is legendary! The game is a must buy!	2015-08-15

Well, I guess the only bad thing I can say about the game is that the soundtrack is unremarkable & forgettable.<br /><br />There's no &#34;right way&#34; to play this game. Every time you reset an area, you can solve a puzzle differently. The only limitations are confined to the game's thesaurus, which will never be as imaginative as you are. There are however a few wrong ways to play, for instance destroying or killing a quest-giving object or NPC, or getting eaten by zombies will force you to reset an area.<br /><br />Let's take the very first quest, for example: Getting a cat out of a tree. You can give Maxwell a jetpack, angel wings, fairy wings, demon wings, a flying carpet, & flying suit, a flying surfboard, you can turn him into a ghost, make him float, make him ride a cloud, create stairs or a ladder, shrink the tree, cross a giant rainbow bridge, & I haven't tried it yet, but possibly you can conjure up a fireman who will rescue the cat for you.<br /><br />Tip: Don't let Maxwell simply &#34;walk&#34; through areas. There's a lot of stuff hidden high above. You can also make him ride & drive things to make him move faster.<br /><br />Tip: Sometimes completing one task will lock out another, so you HAVE to reset the level & get the NPC you chose over last time, like when it comes to the Tree Hugger & the Lumber Jack. Possibly there are ways to satisfy both of their needs at once, but I could think of none.<br /><br />Who is this game best for? No age restriction, but this game will definitely impress children with wild imaginations. It could even be good for sharpening problem solving skills for unimaginative people, & helping with writer's block. & naturally, anyone who loves Mad Libs will its inspiration on this game.	2015-08-15

Is anyone else sick of the trends in the video game industry?  Remember when the point of video games was to simply have fun?  I know I sound like the Pepperidge Farm guy, but seriously, video games are about fun.  Most new games now are about drama, violence, and pwning people.  Mariokart 8 is a big F U to those trends.  Let me give you an example.  Project C.A.R.S. is touted as the most realistic racing game of all time.  You would have to spend hours of your time just to get good enough to race a single lap without crashing.  That doesn't sound like fun.  That sounds like trying to live inside a video game because your life sucks.  I want my video games to be eye-candy that make me smile.  Mariokart 8 is a beautiful, challenging, and fun game that makes me smile.  It's not easy per se, but it's not trying to be real.  It's trying to make you laugh and smile.  The 200 cc mode is really tough, but only if you feel like playing that mode.  You can definitely compete with your friends if you want to as well.  This game has it all.  Nintendo FTW.	2015-08-15

It's kinda interesting how there are Sonic games that tend to be exclusive to handheld gaming systems while spin-off games featuring Sonic tend to mirror the versions released on consoles. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing continues this trend, as it shares (mostly?) the same content with that of the versions on Wii, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC, except made to fit onto the smaller screen of course. It's actually a very impressive conversion! As for the game itself, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing may feature Sonic and co. but it really seems like Sonic only gets top billing in the title just to garner sales; the focus is more on Sega franchises in general. Yeah! Sega actually has more than one video game series! Who knew?<br /><br />Bit of sarcasm aside, this game is basically what you would get if you combined Mario Kart with the concept of Super Smash Bros, except with Sega instead of Nintendo. You get characters and tracks based on series like Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, Jet Set Radio, Samba de Amigo, Alex Kidd, and the list goes on. You race in the Grand Prix, take on the many tracks individually, or partake in various different kinds of Challenges the courses have to offer. The works, really, and I'm not just saying that because that's what I expect out of the usual kart race; I literally mean it works fine as is.<br /><br />If you've played Mario Kart before, you know exactly how this will work. Drive around an elaborate and colorful track (based on a game in this case), use items collected from item capsules scattered around the track to provide benefits and hinder opponents' progress. Dash panels are also around for extra boosts, but there will also be obstacles on the track that can act as items against you. Drifting is also useful for speed and sharp turns, and ramps allow you to perform mid-air stunts for more boosts, almost like in Mario Kart Wii.<br /><br />With the gameplay sum-up said, this game does a great job at emulating what works in Mario Kart! The tracks are memorable and truly elaborate; there is even quite some eye candy to be found along the track surroundings! The graphics are lush and vibrant (the game even mostly runs at a silky-smooth 60fps) and the music is full of remixes from the games that the tracks represent. It almost makes me wish there was a 3D Sonic game on the DS, or a Samba game that could somehow work on the DS. A new Alex Kidd probably wouldn't hurt, either.<br /><br />But yeah, this game is a lot of fun............ON EASY MODE. There's a good reason why I don't FULLY recommend this game; honestly, if you tried playing this game on the Medium or Hard settings, you'll find yourself with AI that is unthinkably unfair. Every time I tried playing the game on these difficulties, I usually end up having an item hit me around every five seconds, and since you lose all momentum when struck, the problem becomes that much more glaring. If you can manage to do well on Medium or Hard, then more power to you! It doesn't change the fact that I'll take Mario Kart's 150cc or Mirror cc over this! It's also kind of a bummer that Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is extinct, so to play this game online, I highly suggest going to the iOS/Android or PC ports, unless if you LOVE giving Microsoft and/or Sony precious money for something as little as online multiplayer.<br /><br />However, the issues at least don't punish you by restricting the features you could potentially access; you purchase unlockable content with the in-game &#34;Sega Miles&#34; currency, which can be earned by playing races regardless of difficulty. So that said, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing is a worthy addition to your DS library if you can accept another kart-racer on the DS that's not called Mario Kart.elaborate; there is even quite some eye candy to be found along the track surroundings! The graphics are lush and vibrant (the game even mostly runs at a silky-smooth 60fps) and the music is full of remixes from the games that the tracks represent. It almost makes me wish there was a 3D Sonic game on the DS, or a Samba game that could somehow work on the DS. A new Alex Kidd probably wouldn't hurt, either.  But yeah, this game is a lot of fun............ON EASY MODE. There's a good reason why I don't FULLY recommend this game; honestly, if you tried playing this game on the Medium or Hard settings, you'll find yourself with AI that is unthinkably unfair. Every time I tried playing the game on these difficulties, I usually end up having an item hit me around every five seconds, and since you lose all momentum when struck, the problem becomes that much more glaring. If you can manage to do well on Medium or Hard, then more power to you! It doesn't change the fact that I'll take Mario Kart's 150cc or Mirror cc over this! It's also kind of a bummer that Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is extinct, so to play this game online, I highly suggest going to the iOS/Android or PC ports, unless if you LOVE giving Microsoft and/or Sony precious money for something as little as online multiplayer.  However, the issues at least don't punish you by restricting the features you could potentially access; you purchase unlockable content with the in-game &#34;Sega Miles&#34; currency, which can be earned by playing races regardless of difficulty. So that said, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing is a worthy addition to your DS library if you can accept another kart-racer on the DS that's not called Mario Kart.	2015-08-15

I learned that Nintendo franchises have a habit where their sequels are little more than upgraded remakes of the previous games with precious few differences, I chose this particular Harvest Moon game because it had significantly better ratings than both The &#34;Tale of Two Towns&#34; & &#34;The Lost Valley.&#34; I latter became aware that &#34;Rune Factory&#34; & &#34;Story of Seasons&#34; are part of the game's franchise.<br /><br />Having played &#34;My Sims Kingdom&#34; & &#34;Animal Crossing: New Leaf,&#34; the gameplay is very similar, but less boring. Yes, I only managed to maintain interest in those games for about 2 weeks before I learned how little they had to offer, but like &#34;Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,&#34; the game unlocks more & more gameplay as you progress through the story. The saccharine-sweet neighbors in ACNL got on my nerves, so I found the snippier HMANB neighbors easier to chew.<br /><br />I skipped earlier Harvest Moon games after being told they put too much emphasis on repetitive farming. In this game, you can choose not to bother with crops at all if you wish, & make all your money off foraging in the woods, honey bees, planting fruit trees, & fishing.<br /><br />I found the clock system rather infuriating, but the game would just be too easy without it. Your forced to conform to other's weekly schedules rather than getting everything you want right away. If you really want something, you have to work for it; making it feel better when you achieve it.<br /><br />I found the sexual orientation of the player characters to be utterly pointless beyond locking who you can flirt with. Firstly it's not fair to the gay or transgendered community (or Fujoshis, Fudanshis, & Yurizukis), & secondly, the characters are androgynous, nether clothing nor hair styles are gender-locked after the tailor & salon are unlocked, & no gender pronouns are ever used to refer to your character. So what was the point?	2015-08-15

The sad thing is there was a ton of potential and it was all squandered with terrible controls and a lazy story. The game is also the buggiest Lego game to date. Certain quests are buggy and the item you need doesn't appear ( black canary aquaman quest), worst yet since some are in the batcave you would have to restart with a new save to fix it.<br /><br />At other times the game locks up or puzzles don't work as they should. The camera, especially in co op is terrible. My son still loves it but the previous batman games were better and lego marvel was way better.	2015-08-15

The RS-1 is seriously underrated. I've had it for just over a month now. It's VERY good for what it is. If you like classic NES games, you will like this. For the money($20+or-), it has exceeded my expectations. I got one in orange. It's a very solid emulator with mostly NES games and a few Famicom built in. The screen looks great. The controls/buttons feel and work very well. Battery life seems like 5-8hrs, like I've seen spec'd elsewhere. I got this for Super Mario and Donkey Kong. I was surprised I liked so many other games. My favorite NES games on it: Goonies, Super Mario Bros, Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers 2, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Junior, Ninja Gaiden 3, Double Dragon 3, Dig Dug, 1990 Tank, 3 Eyes Story. Other NES games: Contra, 1942, Heavy Barrel, Galaga, Desert Tank(Battle Tank), Load Runner 1, 2, Bomber Man, Ninja Gaiden 2, Nuts and Milk, Donkey Kong 3, Mappy, Excite Bike, Popeye, Pacman, Exerion, Joust, Island Adventure, Tetris, Circus Charlie, Spider Man-Sinister 6, Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Tournament Fighters, Yie Ar Kung-Fu, Ice Climber, pinball, Devil World, Galaxian, CrossFire.<br /><br />For whatever reason, youtube reviews of the RS-1 ALWAYS show the weak port/clones of Angry Brids and Plants vs Zombies, and they are not great. They aren't the RS-1's strong points. The NES games I listed above the strong selling points. All games are limited to single player. There are actually maybe 80-90 games. On top of the existing NES games there are also a few extra hacked tweaked versions of games, like Mario in fast mode, Mario &#34;Giant&#34; never gets small or dies from enemy hits, or Donkey Kong 3 &#34;Bandits&#34; redrawn as a Mexican wrestler w cape. The last 50 some game slots are later level selections of longer games because the RS-1 does not have a save function - NES didn't have them either; Mario 2,3,4, etc are levels of original Super Mario1. This is handy if you died and ran out of continues on Super Mario or Chip n Dale at later levels. Buttons A&B are reversed in Mario and Double Dragon 2...not an issue in Super Mario, DD 2 -it's a learning curve. Double Dragon 3 isn't affected. Supplied AV cable is a bit short, about 3ft. Get an RCA coupler and dual RCA cable to extend it for playing on TV.<br /><br />Side notes; Goonies can continue if you use the cheat that worked for NES, UP+A and press START at Game Over screen. You'll know the batteries are low when the picture starts dimming with the sounds/higher volume, but battery life is very good. Screen looks & works very well, reminds me of older car navigation screens matte texture, maybe not the most durable, so I keep the RS-1 in a sunglasses case when not in use -no problems.

There is also a limit to how many saves you can have, which is ridiculous. It feels like it is trying way too hard to be Skyrim (the unnecessary mounts, new crafting, and open world exploration, for a start.) But the worst feature of the game by far is its forgettable, flimsy, and gimmicky characters that feel like the same old Bioware characters instead of unique and interesting people. I often found the side characters more interesting than the companions you spend most of the game with. It felt dull, and you know that spark of interest you get when love a game? That addictive quality that makes you want to play for hours on end? I didn't feel that in Inquisition. Not even a little bit.	2015-08-15

Both were localized in English and debuted to mixed reviews.  Reviewers who couldn't see past the underwhelming graphics and slow paced play disliked it. But the players who &#34;got it&#34; loved the games.<br /><br />Now that we finally have a new title in this series, is it worth dealing with the challenge of playing a Japanese version when you don't read Kanji ?  And also paying to import a copy when the two older games are still plentiful and cheap ?  For veteran fans of the series, it's a conditional &#34;yes&#34;.  If you haven't played before, you'll be better served trying one or the other version of DS VII first.<br /><br />What has changed ?  First, the menus and commands have not, being virtually identical to DS VII.  And this greatly facilitates readily picking up the game if you've played either of the others.<br /><br />So far as the countries go, Exceed 2 introduces 7 new ones.  Thus in addition to the Base 8 of the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, Israel, China and Russia; Exceed 2 adds Italy, Spain, Turkey, India, Sweden, South and North Korea.  Most of the units carry forward from DS VII but there are some new ones.  All told, there are at least 500.  And more countries get air intercept capability this time out.<br /><br />The previous basic game modes are back:  Mission, Campaign, Free Play, Map Editor and with a more extensive Campaign selection this time out.  There's also a Tutorial and a new feature, the Medal Shop where you can use the points accumulated for winning medals to purchase special versions of certain units.  And through the Playstation Network (Japanese), DLC in the form of new units and Campaigns is now in the mix as well as game updates.  Exceed 2 is already patched to v1.01, thus I think it's reasonable to expect continued support of this title from SystemSoft.  Unfortunately, still no Multiplayer.  And aside from the new ones you can unlock in other game modes, porting the same old maps in Free Play to this version was a disappointment to me.<br /><br />The Exceed 2 graphics have received a superficial makeover.  Still, by no stretch of the imagination can Exceed 2 be considered an attractive game.  The maps now have a more 3D look, but zoomed out to any degree, you may as well be playing DS VII.  I actually preferred the more abstract units in DS VII, the color palette of the factions is somewhat more muted (not necessarily a good thing), and the less said about the new battle animations the better.  The best we can say is &#34;beauty is more than skin deep&#34;.<br /><br />The developer ventured little here. It could even be said that SystemSoft dusted off the decade-old DS VII, ported it to the PS3 and barely changed enough to call it a new game.  Be that as it may, for my money it's still hands down the best turn-based tactical modern warfare series available to video gamers. Fans of the series can still enjoy the same replay value, cerebral play and tactical nuance.  As to whether there's enough new here to justify a purchase, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />EDIT:  Twice my saved data glitched and most of my progress was lost.  I was willing to chalk up the first instance to playing the pre-patch version.  Now, it looks like this continues with v1.01, a random and serious bug.  Auto-uploading saves to the Cloud with a PS+ membership eliminated the problem.  Or performing backup utility might also suffice.  But shame on SystemSoft that players would even need to be concerned with it.ones you can unlock in other game modes, porting the same old maps in Free Play to this version was a disappointment to me.

I am a massive fan of both this game and its predecessor. After putting in around 400 hours in this game and 300 in the first, I can say that both are fantastic value. While objectively I believe I have to say the first game outshines the second, subjectively I will say I have enjoyed playing this game more. Forza Horizon's multiplayer was revolutionary in the racing game world. Its &#34;Playground&#34; games were new, exciting and endlessly fun. If Forza Horizon 2 lacks anything from the first game, it is the multiplayer. Playground games are hard to access, and the map itself is not exactly perfect for free roam with many other players as it is simply too big. Regardless, the multiplayer is still solid enough, featuring a voting system where players choose a championship that is 4 random events, which could be Playground games (King of the Hill or Infected) or races, or a combination. The game's graphics are simply stunning. Every tiny detail in mind boggling. Interiors of obscure cars are perfect down to every nook and cranny. (My favorite small detail of Horizon 2 is that your windshield wipers turn off when driving through a tunnel!) The car selection is fantastic and has something for lovers of all kinds of cars, from your hypercars of the 2015s to your classics of the mid 20th century.The player progression system is fair enough, but very simple, if you could consider that a downside, so be it. A player &#34;ranks&#34; up through experience, which is gained from races, events and skill combos. As is with the Forza Horizon franchise, the vinyl creator is weak compared to the Forza Motorsport series. The garage you detail cars in has strange lighting effects, making the shapes you are applying hard to see at times. Forza Horizon 2's difficulty settings are just as fantastic and diverse as the first game's, allowing the newest player or the most elite Forza veteran to enjoy the game their way. The age-old argument against this series is that it is too arcade-racer-esque. That is about as subjective as an opinion gets, I cannot convince you to play it if you enjoy racing simulators more.<br /><br />Overall, out of a 10 scale, I give both this game and its predecessor a 9.	2015-08-15

I absolutely loved the campaign. It was too good to be true. The only other campaign that can even come close to this is World at War. I run out of words when I try to describe the campaign of this game. The story was the best I have ever experienced. The first one was really bad. But this game was ridiculously good. This game is truly amazing. I recommend this game to all looking for a fun game.	2015-08-15

I travel a lot between home and school every year, and haven't had a problem with it at all. The controls take some getting used to because with it being Japanese, they're going to be different. Sometimes it sounds angry when playing discs, but I just bop it on the top and it usually stops. The buttons on it are touch sensitive, so you don't have to place a lot of pressure on the icon.<br /><br />Other people have complained that it isn't really silver. I don't know who they got theirs from, but mine is really silver. It's darker than the picture shown, for sure. The hard drive installed in mine was either 40 GB or 80GB, but I was able to change the hard drive out and put in a 500 GB for a lot cheaper than trying to find a new console with one already installed. I've had this for about a little over a year now, and I have yet to be disappointed. Considering how I keep my consoles in good condition, I expect it to last many years.	2015-08-15

Exactly what my kids were looking for!

This product does not come with a Wii U. It's only the game ($50), a GC controller ($30), and an adapter ($20). That's $100 worth of products for THREE TIMES THAT MUCH. Maybe a Wii U comes with this purchase, which would make it worth it, but since the description says &#34;bundle does not contain Wii console&#34; OH MY GOD DON'T BUY THIS. Unless you're into spending money for no reason. Go outside, find a homeless guy, and give him the $200 dollars you would save by not buying this if you really want to get rid of that cash. For real, how does this product have a good rating? Buy the contents separately. Smash is fun, but it's not $300 fun. Well, since you'll need to still buy the Wii U after getting this product, Smash is not $600 fun. Do yourself and/or that homeless guy a favor and don't buy this awful, incredibly, disgustingly overpriced bundle. Who ever set the price as $300, YOU are an evil, greedy person, unless that incomprehensible profit is going to hungry, homeless people.	2015-08-15

Worth the 10$ new price I spent on it at Gamestop. But don't let this review fool you.

It basically makes all fights you spamming the same move over and over again. But at least all the puzzles are somewhat fun.	2015-08-15

Xbox took a big step backwards	The 360 had almost all the same features as xbox one and the graphics arent that much of a step up. The new features are mostly just hd space takers which makes the entire system laggy and slow. The dashboard is overcrowded and confusing pushing a bunch of nonsence that you will never watch. The system gets extremely hot in very short periods of time but is suppose to be your living room media headquarters. I expect it to be fried in less than a year at this temperature. Sleek box is a dust and scratch magnet. Dont even set controllers on it or its all scratched up.Everything on here is just a link to a download. So my 500gig hd comes with 360 actual usable gigs and a bunch of garbage apps that require even more space when I actually go to use them. Upload studio is a joke but is suppose to be this great editing app. I cant record my music and play games to my own home collection. Cant log into my profile and play offline if xbox live is down. The headset is so cheaply made and the way it attaches to the controller makes it uncomfortable to play with. Controllers feel cheaply made. Controller rechargable battery has low life. Halo requires 80 gigs of space. All games require a download and massive space even if you have the disc. This hd will be full in less than 6 months. Online play always feels laggy even with fast internet speed. Joining a party rarely works correctly. Most of the time it doesnt. Wtf? Seriously this system is 2 years old already and still has all these issues. Dont waste your money. Im not saying buy sony but dont buy this trash. Microsoft screwed everyone on this one.	2015-08-15

They had this game when they were growing up for many years until it finally stopped playing one day. The copy I ordered was a Used-Like New from a seller AmazingDealz.

But the installation of the game from the two disc that it came with is very problematic. When you try to install from the disc it automatically start to download the game which makes no sense what so ever. I went on all the forums searching for a solutions to this problem and realized that it was a problem to a number of other people who bought the game on DVD's.You are bombarded with all sort of solutions you then have to try them all to see which one works for you , and the game makers don't make it any easier for you. It seems like Origin just don't want you to have a pleasurable experience when installing their games.	2015-08-15

There are references to British, American and Japanese television shows and popular movies also old and new video games, manga and anime.  If you have any knowledge of the history of the aftermath of World War II and how Japan and Russia came about to be how they that will be reinforced and if you didn't know for example how the Treaty of San Francisco cost Japan the Kuril Islands in order to gain Okinawa that is included in this game.  Putin and Obama....the H scenes are incidental and can be ignored at no expense to the game which at a great story.

It is definitely not my intention to bash the game and I still encourage everyone to play. Rather, I wanted to foster some (hopefully meaningful) discussion and/or reflection into the potential causes of subscriber losses.<br /><br />Progression: With every expansion pack, the gear we worked so hard for quickly becomes useless, both in pve and pvp. The experience to get back to where we started is fairly predictable - grind 5-10 levels, grind dungeons (or pvp) to get gear good enough to raid (or arena), grind raids (or arena) to get good gear again. What's missing with WoD is that once you've repeated that old cycle, there's no content that really needs that gear. And Tanaan hasn't helped; stand there long enough and ample apexis and baleful will drop to ensure full raid (or arena) quality with little or no effort. But making it so easy to get good gear doesn't matter so long as there is no content for which it is necessary. (I would actually love to see an expansion that expanded the world/experience without requiring do-overs, but that's for another topic).<br /><br />Professions: With WoD, the need for professions was all but made unnecessary. Don't want to spend the gold and time to level leathercrafting? No problem! Just pop up a garrison building. Yet professions were the one form of progression that remained viable from expansion to expansion. They were one of the few unique character abilities that actually carried over and meant something. Not only was theneed to level professions completely removed, the benefit from those professions was also seriously nerfed. Jewelcrafting, anyone? To me, it feels like Blizzard is trying to create an equal and level playing field for all, a sort of socialist experiment that works about as well in-game as it does in real life (my way of saying, not too well). Yeah, it sucks for new players to have to level a profession, but we all had to do it at one time. Now, no one does and hence we all lose.<br /><br />Garrisons (and shipyards): This would have been a great concept for a PE app that was an adjunct to normal gameplay. As is, leveling followers and ships is just a grind within a grind. Worse, it's led to an increasingly solo-play MMO. Add in LFG, LFR, and Custom Group Finder - while otherwise decent enough ideas - in combination with the Garrison model just reinforce the solo model. As a result, there's no sense of horde or alliance &#34;patriotism&#34;. As another reviewer mentioned, in the old days if someone was being ganked, others from that faction would join in. Now it's just insults such as &#34;if you don't want to get ganked, don't play on a pvp server&#34;. Personally, I like pvp servers and don't care if I get ganked, but I surely miss the days when it became a full fledged faction riot. The lack of MMO experience in the WoD expansion has - again, just my opinion - substantially adversely impacted player and faction bonding.<br /><br />No core city: The focus on garrisons is a big part of it, but it's been a developing problem (at least for horde) since Cataclysm. There used to be such a strong sense of community, rogues dancing on top of the bank to open lockboxes, people preening in their fanciest battlegear, guild names were familiar as were a lot of player names. That is all gone. I don't think this is as much due to players leaving the game as it has been to due to central gathering spots being rendered somewhat obsolete, garrisons, and the like. The MMO is fast becoming a distant memory in WoW. It's more like a quick Tinder hookup to run a dungeon or do a daily, then back to secluded play.<br /><br />I also think there is a lot of merit to those who are saying the game is ten years old, declines happen, etc. From that standpoint, I don't think WoD is solely to blame. I do, however, see it as a significant accelerator to decline. It just seems to me that Blizzard is increasingly diminishing customization and individual achievement lest anyone get their feelings hurt. Twinks used to be the sole example of that mindest. But with WoD... Professions? Gone. Gems? Gone. Decent enchants? Gone. Gear? It can still look different thanks to transmog but it can't BE different any longer.<br /><br />TL;DR - No one should get a trophy without effort. Working to get ahead leads to a greater sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Acknowledging and rewarding those efforts keeps players coming back. Fostering community helps set the tone and experience that increases player satisfaction and retention.	2015-08-15

Pros: This is a game that unlocks more & more features as you progress through the storyline. You can play it casually for a few minutes at a time or you can spend your whole weekend on it, it even lets you save mid-dungeon. You get to build your own town & upgrade the facilities with items you get as rewards from missions. This is the only series of games I know where Pokemon are depicted as sentient beings with no master who fight for themselves & Pokemon request to join your team as opposed to being captured...even PETA couldn't pick the morals of this game apart. The game seems to take short attention spans into consideration to not make the gameplay get old fast. You can wander around with your 3DS camera looking for shapes that will convert into random dungeons. If you actually like the story, the game is quite story-heavy. Lastly, I enjoyed how the NPCs in Post Town had something different to say every day, & how your own town's growth ends up giving these Pokemon employment latter on.<br /><br />Cons:The shop NPCs are unbelievably chatty; every transaction will involve lots of dialog that makes it take longer than it should. You can also only sell items either one at a time (takes forever) or in bulk, meaning frequent trips to your storage box to stash things you want to keep. Your character is but a silent observer while your sidekicks do all the talking, & you get all the credit for their work. The story is unbelievably preachy & cheesy in a Comics Code Authority/Motion Picture Production Code sort of way, but with an Eastern twist; it wants to hammer into your head that looking out for one's own self interests & assertiveness are undesirable villainous traits, & that everyone should be extremely humble to the point of having low self esteem, that your only worth is as a supporting member of a team, & that you should always try harder because your best is never good enough. There's also a lot of crying, apologizing, & pessimism, with your sidekick being the sole beacon of optimism in the world. Personally, I found it saccharine & nauseating, but still wanted to see where it was all going.<br /><br />Other: After you gain the ability to have 4 teammates in a dungeon, I find the items you pick up in the dungeon to be pointless 98% of the time, because you heal as you move, your moves evolve to be more powerful with more uses, & you overpower any enemy that isn't a boss, so just sell them all. The soundtrack isn't something I would listen to on it's own, but I never found myself turning it off.	2015-08-15

The GC version has four different modes including 'Arcade', 'Parking', 'Score Attack', and 'Versus'. For each mode you will get to pick between four trucks(Asphalt Cowboy/Highway Cat/Long Horn/Streamline) each with its own strengths and disadvantages.<br /><br />For the arcade mode you need to drive from New York to San Francisco and the game is divided into four stages(NEW YORK-KEY WEST/ST. PETERSBURG-DALLAS/DALLAS-LAS VEGAS/LAS VEGAS-SAN FRANCISCO). With parking mode there are four stages to pick from and in each stage you need to park your truck in five different areas. In score attack you need to make three laps in the allotted time(you earn extra $$$ by hitting certain vehicles) and can pick from four tracks.<br /><br />And finally there is a two-player versus mode where you race against another player to see who can finish three laps in the faster time. I've played this game in the arcades and the GC version is nearly identical(graphics aren't as sharp). The game-play is fast and fun but very short. Recommended if you can find a copy for five bucks or so(or if you enjoyed the arcade version).	2015-08-15

First played it on Android actually (its only 6.99 there) but the concept had me hooked so it came down between PS4 and PC, I decided to go this route only because I can sit on my couch vs sitting in a chair. I'm constantly improving, if you think you've mastered it think again....go online look up other people's creations and you'll be amazed at what some have done. I've been playing for months, I've just learned how piston's work. If you need guides there are tons on Youtube by some pretty awesome minecrafters who know there s***. Even the simplest of task they will show you don't feel discourged most things are pretty straight forward but it is very daunting when you first start. Heck creating your first set of tools is hard building your first house and surviving the night is hard enough. But like watching a work in progress as you go through and build and build and mine and build you'll see yourself grow creatively, there are no instructions on how to create or build. The PS4 is slowly catching up to the PC version still missing a few things here and there but the game is constantly be updated and evolving. Besides at this point in time there are literally like 3 games worth purchasing on the PS4 anyway all the others are coming.	2015-08-15

The charger does NOT fit unless you force it, which entails bending the edges of the case and putting strain on the zipper as well as an unacceptable amount of stress on your 3DS and potentially its LCD (depending on which way you flip the console); which to me, is counter-intuitive to having the case in the first place.

Then, go into an area, shoot. Try to build guardian, go into an area (building), shoot.  I would rather play through Far Cry 4 (a truly 5 star fun game) again than face another hour of Destiny.  Advice:  before you buy it, log onto your PS4 and watch others play.  Watch them go into an area (building) and shoot and then go into another area (building) and shoot. Oh, you can get your friends to help you go into a building (area) and shoot.........and then....well you know.	2015-08-15

Ergonomic, brilliant select/start button placement, great build quality--feels light but not cheap. No problems with long play sessions for small or large hands.<br />Responsiveness is tight and crisp. Microswitch &#34;d-pad stick&#34; feels great, and microswitch face buttons all feel amazing. Closest thing you'll get to an arcade stick feel on a controller.<br />PC compatible is a plus for emulator gamers.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Microswitches are loud in quiet spaces.<br />Only six face buttons and two shoulders limit flexibility for PC gamers.<br />Pad has some problems as it ages. Some diagonal inputs can be hard to trigger accurately.<br />This is the big one. Switches in the pad have a tendency to die after hard use. Mine survived 9 months of 4-day weeks with light to medium use. Controller mashers should look elsewhere.<br /><br />Without the d-pad breakdowns, this controller would be an easy 4.5/5. However I can't morally recommend a controller that will break within a year to everyone. If your controller budget allows for 30-50 bucks a year and you need a good controller for casual fighting games or PC games without analog, this is a good choice. If you're a hardcore fighting gamer on a typical gamer budget or mash your controller like an idiot child, I would recommend something else. Really a shame--the controller feels great until it breaks.	2015-08-15

It's much lighter than most so you may want to open it and add weights to it. Overall it is of fairly nice quality but it certainly can be improved on. Not too hard to customize with more quality parts. For the price it's worth it. My only major complaint is how small the square gate is. I feel it hinders execution to an extent cause you have less room to actuate the motion properly. Maybe it's just me though.<br /><br />Buttons feel a little loose to me but they hold up well. Worth looking into change options.<br /><br />I think the bigger justification on buying is the rarity of the product. Extremely difficult to find elsewhere	2015-08-15

If I could give this a negative star rating, I would. But unfortunately, I cannot. So a one star rating will have to do.<br /><br />Where do I begin? How about all of the bogus, false claims this waste of a product makes. I'll go down the list.<br /><br />- &#34;Improves your grip when gaming&#34;<br /><br />This couldn't be further from the truth. Once I had followed all of the application directions & applied the pea-sized amount it suggested, my grip was actually worse than it was before. When I was firmly holding on to my Xbox One controller during a heated Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare match, I could slowly feel my grip loosening around my controller. This product does not under any circumstances, improve your grip. It worsens it.<br /><br />- &#34;Hands stay dry for up to 4 hours&#34;<br /><br />This has to be the most laughable of the claims. My palmar hyperhidrosis symptoms range from moderate to extremely severe depending on the circumstance. Even with the product fully applied, I could instantly feel the moisture trying to escape through my palms. I felt this almost immediately during the start of gameplay. It is a very nerve-racking & uncomfortable feeling (especially when you suffer from some form of OCD). I prefer my old method of dealing with the moisture during lengthy gaming sessions by setting my controller down, washing my hands thoroughly, drying them completely, & returning to my game. I find myself repeating these steps more frequently than I would like, but I get infinitely better results versus using this pathetic product.<br /><br />- &#34;Blocks sweat at the source before it starts!&#34;<br /><br />Again, couldn't be further from the truth. As I just stated previously, the cream actually induces sweat. As unbelievable as this was, it actually made my palmar hyperhidrosis more severe. My palms felt so clammy that I almost became sick thinking about it.<br /><br />- &#34;Dries clear and leaves no residue&#34;<br /><br />I'm not sure what GamerGrip defines as &#34;clear&#34;, but this certainly isn't the case. The combination of the extra moisture that the cream induced with the cream itself created a very clammy/sticky texture. While it is true that the product itself leaves no visible residue, the excess moisture coupled with the feel of the cream itself more than substitute as actual residue.<br /><br />- &#34;Will not stain controllers or clothing&#34;<br /><br />While I have not tested the clothing bit, what I can confirm is that this product does indeed stain parts of your controller. After only playing one match in Call of Duty & deciding that I couldn't bear the feeling anymore, I closely inspected every facet of my controller to see what cosmetic damage it had endured while I was holding it. It had a few spots on the back that showed visible dry moisture marks. The buttons had crusted dry marks as well. My analog sticks suffered the worst from it. There were severe crusted thumb print marks on both sticks. Just looking at them was enough to make me sick to my stomach. I had to wet the tip of my pinky ever so slightly & rub water on each stick to get rid of the dried on thumb prints. It worked to some extent, but you can still make out the faint marks it left behind. This will in fact stain your controller in some fashion.<br /><br />- &#34;Non-sticky, non-toxic, fresh scent&#34;<br /><br />It's probably non-toxic & literally the only positive I can give this sorry excuse of a product is that it indeed has a fresh scent. Think spearmint gum. However, the &#34;non-sticky&#34; part is a complete & blatant lie. As I had described previously, it makes your palms feel quite sticky with the combination of the cream itself, & the excess moisture it causes.<br /><br />In conclusion, in no way does this product achieve anything it leads you to believe. It makes the already terrible condition of palmar hyperhidrosis worse & on top of that, has the potential to do some serious long-term cosmetic damage to your gaming equipment. I will never purchase any product like this ever again.  You're much better off taking $12.95, dousing it with kerosene, & dropping a lit match on it. You'd get far more enjoyment wasting $12.95 that way as opposed to wasting it on a complete & total joke of a product like GamerGrip. STAY AS FAR AWAY AS HUMANELY POSSIBLE FROM THIS PRODUCT!our gaming equipment. I will never purchase any product like this ever again.

Meaning, rather than being docked ten seconds every time you fall off and redo the obstacle, you have to swim to the next obstacle. One setting you get three chances to pass it and then it moves you forward. The other setting you have to do it until you successfully pass the obstacle. They also made the contestants really annoying. Every time you fall off, they say a catch phrase. At the end of the course they dance around and say another catch phrase. Yes in real life they do this at the beginning of the show and in interviews, but it doesn't continue throughout the entire episode.

Firstly,  I will leave aside the issues that occurred at start up as the game has now been out for a few months.<br /><br />This game might be nice,  for an MMO.  I don't frequently play them.  So keep in mind that this review is coming from the gamer type that is purchasing it as an Elder Scrolls title.<br /><br />Several things I didn't prefer in this game were the following. That speaking to NPC pulls you out of the game and into a chat box that you need to read which was very distracting.  I didn't like that I couldn't loot as freely as I previously could in Skyrim.  You can see a sword on someone you recently killed but cannot pick up and take the sword.  I felt the graphics with a little childish for my taste.  Overall the game was not bad,  but if I was spending my free time playing a game I found I just kept hopping back onto Skyrim.	2015-08-15

I was never a fan of the more crime-focused open-world games involving cops and gangsters taking part in shootouts and car chases like in Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row (the earlier games), True Crime, L.A. Noire, etc. Despite the good things I heard about Sleeping Dogs when it was first released on the PS3, I initially ignored it since it seemed like just another gang-related open world title taking place in Hong Kong. But after catching some Youtube clips of the game out of sheer curiosity, I jumped on the Definitive Edition after it had gone down to a great price, and I'm glad I took that chance. In Sleeping Dogs, you are Wei Shen, an undercover cop whose job is to infiltrate the triads of Hong Kong and bring down their most powerful leaders. The story has a relatively simple set-up, but its delivery is certainly above average. Wei is a very relatable and likeable protagonist and you quickly grow to care for him and worry for his safety when he finds himself in trouble of possibly having his cover blown and when dealing with traitors from both sides. Friends become enemies, enemies become friends, you know, the good stuff. And both the main and side-missions offer a variety of objectives, such as going on drug busts, tailing suspects, and impressing the ladies with your karaoke skills. There are even a number of collectibles to find, like health shrines to increase your overall health and jade statues to help you learn stronger melee combos.<br /><br />Another big reason for me deciding to give this game a shot was its focus on melee combat...specifically lots of \\\"kung-fu fighting\\\\\". HIYA! In my experience, melee combat usually takes a back seat to driving and shooting in most of these types of open-world games. Even the games I actually played like Watch Dogs and Red Dead Redemption had very basic melee combat that didn't give you many options. But in Sleeping Dogs, you'll be punching, kicking, and countering your way through lots of triads with style, making use of a number of combos and special grapple moves. These grapple moves let you do things like smack enemies into walls or railings, throw them over ledges, and most impressively, finish them off in brutal and gruesome fashion with environmental finishing attacks. These attacks will allow you to throw enemies into dumpsters, drop them onto the pointed noses of severed swordfish heads, bash their heads into whirling wall fans, and even throw them into ice chippers. The finest executions available, courtesy of the fine folks in Hong Kong. Oh, and you'll also be able to make use of certain weapons in melee combat, namely meat cleavers, kitchen knives, tire irons, and police batons.<br /><br />Even though melee combat is the most common way to do away with your enemies, there are still a fair number of shootouts to be had. You only have access to firearms during the specific moments where you're forced into firefight situations, with pistols, assault rifles, and the occasional shotguns and grenade launchers rounding out your arsenal. While the shooting mechanics were solid enough, the main problem with them was that the hit detection was a bit iffy. There have been a number of times where I would be aiming directly at enemies' heads, only for my shots to hit them in the shoulder instead. And when firing multiple shots at enemies with automatic weapons, I've had enemies stagger after being hit by the first two shots and then have the rest of the shots fly through them without damaging them at all; it was as if enemies somehow developed invincibility frames whenever they were hit by automatic weapons fire. This wasn't a serious problem, but it definitely happened often enough to annoy me.<br /><br />Fortunately, the driving mechanics fare much better, especiallywhen you compare them to the way cars operated in Watch Dogs. Pretty much every car I drove in Sleeping Dogs handled very well and usually whenever I crashed into something it was my fault since I was going extra fast. Boat controls were a different story. The larger ones would handle like bricks, refusing to turn at all unless you go in reverse, but fortunately the smaller, faster boats were much easier to control. There's still a negative side to driving, and that's the camera. When moving the camera to the side or behind your vehicle, the camera tends to go nuts and move around some more on its own once you start driving the vehicle. Another little annoyance. But to help balance things out further, you can shoot while driving, a feature that was noticeably missing in Watch Dogs. And let's not forget the ability for Wei to hijack vehicles by jumping out of his current vehicle while driving at high speeds. One other little featured I appreciated in this game was the wide assortment of different outfits and clothing items you could get for Wei. A number of these different outfits not only give you a variety of new looks for Wei, but they also give him perks like discounts on other items, increasing melee damage, and even having access to certain weapons.<br /><br />This Definitive Edition comes with all the DLC, including the three story-based DLCs: The Zodiac Tournament, Nightmare in North Point, and Year of the Snake. The Zodiac Tournament is the shortest one, but also contains the most challenging fights for Wei in the entire game. Nightmare in North Point adds supernatural elements and enemies to the Sleeping Dogs universe, very much like the Undead Nightmare DLC for Red Dead Redemption, and it actually has a good story of its own. Year of the Snake has Wei basically go \\\\\"full cop mode\\\\\"; he's no longer doing the secretive, undercover cop thing, so he'll be doing things like quelling riots, dealing with bomb threats, and even arresting people for public urination.<br /><br />Since I didn't play the original version of this game for the previous generation of systems, I can't really say what other kinds of improvements have been added to this Definitive Edition. I will say that the graphics do look updated enough to pass for a game that was an early PS4 release, for the most part. While Wei and the other main characters looked nice and detailed, many of the other NPCs looked noticeably \\\\\"last gen\\\\\". This wasn't too much of a big deal for me, but I'm sure other gamers might count this as a big time no-no. What I did find to be a somewhat bigger annoyance was how often characters would clip through the environment. Several times while fighting enemies I would notice Wei and the enemies he was beating the crap out of would phase through nearby walls and fences. If this was an issue in the original version of the game, it seems it's still an issue now. Despite these niggling little flaws, Sleeping Dogs was a fun and addictive game and I'm glad I finally got around to trying it out. If you missed out on the original version of this game and are still considering giving it a shot yourself, then get the Definitive Edition now, it's well worth the current price. As an added note, this game makes me want to do something else I should have done a long time ago, which is catch up on some more Bruce Lee movies.o the way cars operated in Watch Dogs.

I bought this in the last week from another retailer promotion. The deal was just to good to skip.<br /><br />Anyways I have been avoiding this console for some time and to be honest...at the current price it simply isn't worth the cash. Don't get me wrong I am seriously enjoying my time with Forza but in the last week I bought as many games for my Vita as I plan for the X1 in the next year.<br /><br />Okay now I am going to go onto other things.<br /><br />First, this thing is SLOW. The only thing slower is my 3ds and Wii U. It isn't even on the same level with my PS4. That thing is turned on and in netflix in seconds where this is like a min. The UI is terribly cluttered and busy. While I never really cared for PS4s simplistic approach I now understand why it is there. It is lightning fast. The PS4 actually feels an entire generation ahead in this area.<br /><br />Second, Microsoft for some reason believes people like crazy vivid colors and crushed blacks. Issue with this is that it seems to apply to the entire console. Games have crushed blacks, media...if you don't know what that is then allow me to explain. After a certain level of darkness the X1 just turns the pixel to absolute black. So in the event you are looking at a dark jacket you won't be able to see the fine details. In Forza Horizon 2 it makes night driving quite awful. I had to jack up the brightness to offset it but THAT ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO FIX THIS.<br /><br />Games..this is where it gets hairy. I personally think we should try and own all the consoles. I am not getting Forza Horizon 2 on my PS4 and I am not getting Star Ocean or Uncharted on my X1. They each have amazing game libraries to pull from. I really think this point needs to be drove home. This is why I can overlook some of the issues. In the end the games make the system.<br /><br />Anyways my suggestion to a new buyer with no consoles would be to get the PS4 first and get this second. This is a good console but I would NEVER purchase it as my main machine. It is just to slow and clunky. It is hard to believe this is going on 3 years old and still has errors all over the place. Games though :p<br /><br />Oh yea...and get a Wii U. ;)	2015-08-15

If there is an easier way to do this, I am sorry for wasting your time and would certainly appreciate you pointing me toward the light. So, I got these headphones and they have been working great with my PS4. No problems at all so far but I've only used them for a few hours now. One thing I wanted to do was pair these headphones with my android phone. The trick for the headphones, obviously, is plugging in the supplied USB dongle to make the connection. How do you plug a male USB into an android phone/tablet?

I would have rated the first in this series as a 5/5. That game was excellent. This one is a disaster. The game is incredibly preachy. After you make it to the city of Seastone, your are lambasted with a storyline that devolves into socialist propaganda. The game overtly tries to convince you that anyone with money is evil. It espouses some of the most tired one liners about why socialism is good, and spends an incredible amount of time painting it as purely good. It even uses the Ingsoc black fist on a read background as the flag of the resistance group that Ivo and Wilbur eventually become a part of.<br /><br />Subtlety is far from its strong suite in the story here. It will make you cringe being told over and over again how bad and privileged certain people are for finding any sort of happiness in capitalism (Unless of course you consider yourself a socialist, in which case you are going to find yourself in an echo chamber where you hear everything you want to hear).<br /><br />This mostly bugs me because I came to have fun and solve puzzles; not to have a game cram a political agenda down my face hole and become a propaganda piece. The puzzles are certainly there, but they are not as logical, tough, or complex as in the first Book of Unwritten Tales. Some puzzles are insanely easy, while some are so illogical that the only way to solve them is to have happened to have a life experience that makes this seem sensible, or to get lucky (possibly trying random items out on random interactive objects etc.).<br /><br />Overall, I am very disappointed in this installment. There's no excuse for this type of story. The writer of this story is better suited for the Ministry of Thought than fantasy writing. The puzzles were acceptable enough to make the game occasionally fun. Because I got some enjoyment out of the puzzles, I gave the game 2 stars.	2015-08-15

I had seen it on store shelves occasionally and always scoffed at how ridiculous it seemed. Then I played it at a friends house and was hooked. I immediately ordered my own copy. I played through it twice, which I almost never do with video games, once in the normal difficult and then again on the hardest. It has a ton of replay value if you wanna unlock all of juliets outfits and song tracks. I even started playing to complete achievements and got them all. The game play is fun, fast paced, and engaging. The storyline is humerous with plenty of funny situations and commentary. Overall I will say that this game is probably one of he best I have ever played, and at $15 bucks, it's a steal! It recently sold reached the 1 million copies sold mark, so I'm hoping that a sequel is in the work.	2015-08-15

Using the 3DS was causing my big hands to cramp. It fits around the product snugly (which is a 3DS XL). The grips on the bottom are great for holding the system steady while at the same time giving the rest of your fingers a more relaxed place to rest.<br /><br />My one complaint is that it blocks the AC adapter port slot, so there are times I have to stretch it a little to plug the adapter in, as shown by the photo. I use the Nintendo manufactured adapter that came with the 3DS. I don't feel like it's enough to take off a star, but it is worth mentioning.	2015-08-15

It's not possible to beat it.  However, Nintendo came pretty close with this game.  Wii U Smash is a worthy second place game IMHO.<br /><br />Pros: Graphics, Characters, Levels, Gameplay<br />Cons: Online can be laggy, some of the classic characters' moves are slightly different, so I am forced to relearn how to play with them.  For example, Falco's spike is timed differently, so I am constantly mis-timing my spikes with him.  I think this was intentionally done to make the game feel different.<br /><br />This is the best game on the system, and a must have.	2015-08-15

Nowhere else does a person be able to control and command the Titanic. Granted this game can be boring at times but I felt it was well done. I recommend this version the &#34;Collector's Edition&#34; and not the original 2008 version because you get more ships plus some graphical issues seem to be fixed in this one. I have owned both versions. This does work on Windows 8 even though at least for me when I exit the game sometimes the quickviewer will stop working but I'm still able to reenter the game just fine and exit again so it's not a major issue. So if you want to try one of the Ship Simulator games, let it be this one.	2015-08-15

This is a great game for people of all ages. Knack has a charming look and an equally charming story (yes, I actually teared up at one point). The gameplay mechanics are solid and very simple, and the concept is amazingly creative and fresh (Cerny's still got the touch after all of these years).<br /><br />An important thing to note is that this game is easy enough on the easy setting that my five year old nephew beat almost all of it with no help (including the final boss). However on higher difficulties it becomes a real challenge to complete even the earlier chapters, so kids and adults alike can enjoy this one, and the same goes for experienced and inexperienced adult or teen gamers.<br /><br />One person I know went as far as to say Knack is the best game they've ever played, and while I won't echo that I will say that if this entire generation of games were to turn out like this one, it would be a pretty great generation and I would have no complaints.<br /><br />Don't come here looking for cutting edge graphics or gameplay (though the graphics --while tooney-- are impressive), because that stuff isn't what Knack is about. It's about a simple story that will pull you in if you've a heart for it's kind of tale at all. It's also about originality and just good clean fun.<br /><br />This game also has tons of depth for completionists like myself. I've played through three times and I'll play through at least twice more just so I can 100% it. The story is also roughly 12-16 hours long, so if you shoot for a Platinum trophy or just plain completion of all of the collections you'll easily sink 70+ hours into the game. And the extra modes you unlock are often intensely challenging, meaning you'll likely sink a few more hours into them trying to complete them. And if you're like I suspect I will be, it'll be a game that you'll come back to several times even after getting that Platinum trophy.<br /><br />Verdict: Knack is a must play for fans of Adventure games, old school (think PS2) games, or people who want a friendly and fun introduction to the world of modern gaming or just plain enjoy heartwarming tales of heroism, friendships, love, and loyalty. I could not possibly be more pleased with my purchase of this game, and it'll make a great addition to your library of PS4 games if it at all appeals to you from the outside.	2015-08-15

The battery packs fit nicely in the charge station and fit perfectly inside the controller as well no tight squeezes or anything.  ****update****  I have been using this for almost a year now and the unit hasn't skipped a beat.

DS shells are surprisingly fragile and the paint gets scratched with just about anything. Now only the protector will get scratched. I hope not though because it makes the ds look pretty.

I mean, it's so beautiful. Functionally though, it's a tad small. My 3DS XL is wearing one of those clear hard plastic protectors and the case is just barely able to close up on it. Also, there is no room for the charger. It fits six cartridges but just barely cuz the slots are on the small side as well. The bright side is that it doesn't occupy a lot of space when traveling with it. All in all I'm happy with it. It has an awesome color and texture and it looks better than in the pictures. I've had other cases though and I can tell this one is going to be fragile. We'll have to take extra good care of them so that the yellow doesn't get dirty or the pikachu doesn't start to peel. I'm keeping it in a little pouch. It feels kinda silly, having my 3DS inside a case inside a pouch, but I like taking care of my pokemon stuff. Again, overall, great product if you like small, efficient cases and are a pokemon fan.	2015-08-15

The system work's great. The whole family loves it.

I must admit I'm thoroughly enjoying this system so far and I'm looking forward to checking out more games for it. Not saying I'm gonna retire the PS4 or anything, but Nintendo has stepped up their game on graphics and game play bigtime! Definitely recommend this system and this seller.	2015-08-15

I bought this as a Christmas present for my niece, but ended up buying two accidently so I kept it for myself and tried it out.<br /><br />The music selection was great and the dance moves were fun! I was able to keep up and I am not a dancer by any means, lol.<br /><br />The flow was excellent. Some dance games get to be a little funky, but this one definitely serves it's purpose.	2015-08-15

The screwdriver included wasn't correctly sized to fit the screws, but I had one that was. Guts to a controller model no. CUH-ZCT1U don't fit 100%. The light bar was previously installed using 4 screws, not 2 like the ZCT1U models. This shell is of that older (4 screw) model so you'll have to modify the shell and that last, long white piece of the light bar to get it to fit correctly. All-in-all nothing that an exacto and a little sandpaper couldn't fix. Touchpad comes off easily enough after you run a hair dryer over it (on low) for 5-10 minutes. I would also maybe recommend taking off some of the adhesive if you really want the touchpad sensor to be seen. I haven't yet but plan on doing so soon. Overall I am happy with my purchase.	2015-08-15

Not a sound.  Of course there is only a 90 day warranty on this item so we are out of the warranty period.  I will say the headphones are super comfortable, they worked great while they worked, and my son loved them.  He is very responsible and careful with them.  However at $50 bucks a pop that means spending over $100 per year on headphones which makes me a pretty unhappy consumer and I would not recommend this product for that reason.  I'm going to look into another brand as a replacement for these.	2015-08-15

I got these for my Gunnar SteelSeries Scope model computer glasses, and am glad I did.  It would be nice if they were included in the glasses for the price, but they aren't, and bottom line, they are worth it.  The little bag that comes free offers little protection, and takes a while to wrestle on and off.  The glasses fit fine in the case, as long as you put them in resting on the top of the glasses - if you try putting them in lens-side down it will not close.  Different models of glasses may fit more or less easily.<br /><br />Not only is this case more protective, but it is very quick to get the glasses in and out, especially once you get used to putting them in the correct way.  Just a note, they do not latch closed in any way, so be careful how you cram them into a bag to avoid accidental opening.  Other than that, they are convenient and do the job well.  Highly recommended if you have a pair of Gunnar glasses.	2015-08-15

Every December marks the annual renewal of our XBOX Live Account. With that said, our family has been using Live for almost ten years and we've found that these codes from Amazon are the simplest and safest way to renew or even start a new XBOX Live Account.<br /><br />To start of renew, you have the choice of using your own credit/debit card, a store bought card, or an online gaming code. I've renewed our account using all of these methods and the code from Amazon has been the best way to go. Last Christmas Eve, I saved close to $20.00 and got this code for $39.99. That's quite a big savings and well worth the price.<br /><br />I belive XBOX Live will let you piggy back these (up to three years). So, when they're on sale, it's best to get them then; and just put the codes that come to the email address registered with Amazon into your XBOX Live Account.<br /><br />I highly recommend Amazon and this method for all of your XBOX Live needs!	2015-08-15

This game is very different from the other MMO's that I have played.  The combat can feel a little clunky and slow at times, but the meat of the game is in problem solving and puzzles and mystery!  If you like trying to figure out things then you may find this game to be a lot of fun.  If you are into fast combat with movement like that in World of Warcraft you might be disappointed.  There are no real levels, but you acquire higher level gear and talismans as you go through each mission.  There is a separate story line for each faction, but the main missions and such are the same for each faction.  There are some insanely intense moments of very scary scenes and areas that will literally have you biting your nails or sitting on the edge of your seat.  It centers around a story of a fog and creatures coming in from a fog and how a main town brought havoc onto the main cities through magic!  I really enjoyed the game and found it to be thoroughly entertaining.  It is very challenging so don't expect this to be an easy peasy MMO to get through.  It takes time and patience, but if you like scary stories and mystery this game will be for you!  I highly recommend.	2015-08-15

Constantly getting booted, as many of my friends who still own the game are, if I could sign in at all to begin with.  The game itself, what little I was able to play of it, was fun like any other elder scrolls game  with one main difference being I could play skyrim, I was never allowed to play this game spent 60 bucks on it and sold it go gamestop for 25.  And I feel like I ripped them off to be honest this game was hot garbage	2015-08-15
