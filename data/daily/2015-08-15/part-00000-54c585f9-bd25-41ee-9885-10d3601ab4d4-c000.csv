I tried a few others and really like this one. I find it does best if I spray it the night before and sleep in it. In the morning my hair is as light as the first day. Also I am super blonde so if I am between touch ups I spray a little e trap around my hairline to cover my regrowth.  I have even sprayed it in my toddlers hair. She has super fine hair and it can help keep her hair tighter in a pony or with a bow.	2015-08-15

These hold surprisingly well if you spritz them sparingly and make sure to give them a minute or two to set in your mouth before eating.  I'm guessing the bad reviews were from folks that saturated them before use or didn't know how to trim them correctly.  The hold doesn't last quite as long as tube adhesive, but the lack of mess and potential for gagging on the left over adhesive are big pros over any other point in my opinon.	2015-08-15

Spray	Beauty	3	39	45	N	N	I've used different brands of rose water before and loved the results	This toner smells lovely, just as I would expect from rose water. I've used different brands of rose water before and loved the results. So, I was exited to try the First Botany brand.<br />The toner uses some great natural ingredients like rose oil and aloe vera juice. These are mild ingredients that are recommended for people with sensitive skin.<br />However, it also uses Phenoxyethanol and Tetrasodium EDTA which are a stabilizer and preservative respectively. Both of these ingredients are penetration enhancers, meaning that they break down your skin's natural barriers, so that these ingredients go right into your bloodstream. Tetrasodium EDTA is also made from formaldehyde and sodium cyanide which are known carcinogens.<br />Since I received this item as a review, I did not have a chance to go over the ingredient listing in detail. Had I known this, there is a good chance that I would have skipped reviewing this product.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

Sits rather heavily on the hair. Doesn't work all that well as a conditioner IMHO compared to the super-cheap conditioners I usually buy. I'm not really impressed with this product. Nice squishy bottle which is easy to use in the shower, however. Perhaps it will work better for you.<br /><br />---<br /><br />At the end of the day: this product produces nicely behaved, manageable hair! It doesn't go on all that well IMHO, but as your hair dries and you go about your day, your hair is kept from getting too frizzy and out-of-control. Still not wild about the fragrance but this product does a nice job keeping your hair looking good (I've got long hair).	2015-08-15

I started my EO journey a little over 3 months ago. After attending a disappointing presentation by a rep from an mlm company. It spurred me on to do my own research. I came across Plant Therapy (PT) and choose it as my go to company for essential oils. I made this choice because they espouse safe usage (have hired one of the go to people on using EOs safety as a consultant who also developed their &#34;kids safe&#34; line), have trained aromatherapists on staff to answer questions, support a fabulous FB page on safe usage, etc. PT really thinks of the little touches, the EO bottles have labels on the top with the names of the oils/synergies. Trust me, it really makes it easier to find what you want/need as your collection grows. You don't have to pick up each oil and read the name. You can just glance from above. On top of that, they always offer free shipping!  This is the first time I've gotten a roller ball from PT. It was offered at a reduced price for an honest review, so I thought it would be a good time to try one. Price wise, I'm not sure why people buy the pre-diluted rollerballs. I'm sure it must be for the convenience. While all of the kidsafe rollerballs have the dilution %, I couldn't find this for the adult rollerballs. All of the rollerballs use fractionated coconut oil as their carrier oil. The pluses are that it's inexpensive and it has a lot longer shelf life then most carrier oils. The minus is that it doesn't have the therapeutic benefits of the other carrier oils (including regular coconut oil.) If you buy the undiluted synergy, you can make many rollerballs for a fraction of the price of one prediluted rollerball.  I am not one who loves floral scents. The Anti-Age Synergy has some over powering florals in it--Geranium, Jasmine, Rose (and non floral Sandalwood, which I don't like) predominate, but I could be wrong. I used it on my face a few hours before I took my Pilates class this morning. Despite the fact that it seemed to absorb easily, it's all I could smell HOURS later. It was still VERY strong. When mixing EOs for therapeutic purposes, you're not going for aroma, as you do when diffusing for non therapeutic reasons.  I think it's the kind of scent that's a love/hate smell. Just don't know if I can continue using it on my face. . I may try to use it on my hands (something further from my body) to see if I can stand it--and if it makes them look younger.  One last comment, the rollerball is a really nice one. Amber colored with a stainless steel rollerball. It's a higher quality rollerball then some that I've bought. The glass is thicker and shouldn't break easily. It should last a long time. In the past, I've had problems with plastic rollerballs falling out of the plastic holder when using fractionated coconut oil.  I can reuse this one for other products, although I may have to replace the rollerball parts if I can't get the scent out of the plastic part.	2015-08-15

I love trying new beauty products and creams so I was very excited to be offered this cream at a promotional price to review honestly.  I have used it for a few weeks now and it's honestly not my personal favorite cream.<br /><br />Things I don't like about it:<br />*  It's heavy feeling.  I feel it when I use it.  It's a thick cream and for this reason I only use it at night.  I can feel it on my face for a long time.  Maybe that's a positive for it moisturizing longer?<br />*  It's basically odorless, but there is a faint smell that is likely the retinol that I'm not fond of.  I like the retinol so I can definitely deal with this.<br /><br />Things I really like:<br />*  The volume.  Typically creams with these ingredients come in oversized bottles with 1 oz. or less.  This one has 2 oz!  I really like that.<br />*  The pump locks.  I love that the pump for the cream locks.  I have hear that you should always keep any product with retinol tightly sealed to keep it working properly and this product does that.<br />*  Overlooking the heaviness of the cream I can feel my skin tightening.  I like that in an anti-aging cream!  It feels like it's doing it's job.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I like the product and will finish using the entire bottle.  Will I order it again?  I am still undecided.	2015-08-15

I have been dealing with postpartum hair loss since I had my daughter 2 months ago. My hair was constantly clogging up the drain or getting stuck in my vacuum cleaner.

Others would call it &#34;invigorating.&#34;  I use mine exclusively for dry brushing your skin, but have not used it in the shower, so I cannot comment on wet brushing.

Beauty	4	0	0	N	N	Very gentle on my sensitive skin! Happy Customer	I have very sensitive skin. I have tried manyl facial cleansers and exfoliating products. When I was given an opportunity to try this product, I was very skeptical about the effectiveness. Most facial cleanser and exfoilating products that I have tried, irritated my skin. My face gets very dry, itchy, and tight. Sometimes, I have redness with a tingling sensation witha lot of product sI have tried in the past. This Ariam Beauty product states it is a gentle exfoliating cleanser. I like the fact that it has Green Tea Leaf extract as one of the ingredients. The directions says to use twice daily.I pumped a small amount of cleanser into my hand and massaged onto my damp face in a circular motion. Initially, I noticed that my skin did not start itching. the cleanser was not rough or harsh on my skin.After rinsing the cleanser off my face, I did not see any redness or dryness. My face was not burning or tingling. I have been using this product for a few days now so that is why I gave four stars.So far, I have not had any skin irritations. I also love the smell and smooth, creamy consistency of the cleanser .I will continue to use the rest of the bottle to see what happens.

I knew that they were considered &#34;long,&#34; but the length was CRAZY long for me, the lashes were up to my eyebrows! After cutting them with scissors they looked obviously cut and completely unnatural, I was glad that it came with 3 packs of lashes. After a couple tries I learned that it was better to apply these lashes so that they curve &#34;outward&#34; instead of vertically and looking way too dramatic. I also learned that these did not come with their own glue so I had to buy that separately. Despite all the trouble, these lashes were great at really making my eyes pop in photos. They were very high quality, but next time I will buy a shorter length.	2015-08-15

Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy. It simply did not work for us, now my head itches every day and I've never had this problem before. Another warning, the fumes are awful while applying the product. We had all the windows open, fan blowing and we were sitting near the open door. Our eyes were burning from the fumes and got a scratchy, nasty feeling in the throat. It took us almost 4 hrs each to get through the entire procedure and of course we are very disappointed in wasting our time and money on this product. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend products from this company to anyone.	2015-08-15

This product was honestly not as great as I thought it would be personally but it does work, just not as great for wavy hair (I'm guessing) I have wavy hair and the pomade looks nice, clean and fresh cut when i first put it on but to hold up my pompadour, it takes at least 3 or 4 finger scoops to do so. This probably works alot better on straight hair but when I am done with this jar, I will be moving on to wax. But despite those things, this product is great, and it smells AMAZING. Every morning when I get ready, it's like a routine to smell it before I put it in my hair. Lol	2015-08-15

US	39743123	RLKLXLE5BT2IB	B001ET76EY	530825264	Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser	Beauty	4	5	7	N	N	Good for men and women.	I first purchased this Cetaphil (cleanser) two years ago when they were on sale at BJ’s. Now I buy them through my husband’s prime account which is cheaper. My husband tried this and loved it, now he uses this after he shaves his face, because he loves how smooth it make his face. This product has actually become a staple for me (and now my husband) which is hard to believe, because I LOVE  trying new products.  First, I want to point out that Cetaphil makes two cleanser this one and another, which is for “ Normal to oily skin”. I have never tried the other cleanser so I will not be doing a comparison in that perspective. What I will do is better help you understand what you will and will not get form this product.<br /><br />What to expect: This product is very mild as it is for sensitive skin. You can use it with or without water. This product is very thin so I prefer using it without water, since using it with water (on a damp face) makes it feel like it is sliding off my face.  This  is  a soap-free cleanser so do not expect suds when lathering  with it. A little goes a long way for me a 16 oz bottle last three months; my routine is to use it morning and night. This specific product can be used on your body and on babies as well since it is non-comedogenic  (it does not clog your pores which is how pimples are formed) and fragrance free. Your face will feel very soft and hydrated after using it. If you are currently experiencing an acne break out this product will not aggravate your skin, it will gently clean the pores which will overtime get rid of the acne.<br /><br />What not to expect: This brand of Cetaphil will not fix acne breakout within a week, in fact it takes weeks from my experience, which is why I use another product when I have a break out.  This product will not do anything for acne scaring or discoloration on your skin from my experience. After using this product your skin will not feel tight or dry.<br /><br />Tips:<br />1) It cleans makeup brushes very well .<br />2) For acne prone people (like myself) you may need another product specifically for acne. Since this brand is for sensitive skin you can follow up with Cetaphil before or after using  an acne specific product one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid for spot treatment.<br /><br />** Thanks for reading and I hope this information was helpful to you **eup brushes very well .<br />2) For acne prone people (like myself) you may need another product specifically for acne.

Conair has always been a name I trusted in the past.  Approximately the 4th time of using this hot roller set, I plugged it in and in about 10 minutes later found that 8 out of the 20 rollers had melted down on the heating rods.  The rollers melted to the base whereby they were stuck and could not be removed.  I like the style and multiple sizes of the rollers and the clips; however, I do not trust the overheating.  I don't know if there is a warranty, but I will be contacting Conair regarding this potentially hazardous product.	2015-08-15

This supplement (palm fruit extract) is well worth the money. I have only been taking it for a couple months now and my hair and skin are looking extra healthy. I live in California where its sunny everyday in the summer and my skin would usually burn after an hour or two of sun without sunscreen. I had read some reviews about its protective qualities within the skin, so I decided I would try for myself to see if it had affected my resistance to sunburn. I had my shirt off while I was outside gardening from noon until 7 pm. I thought for sure when I walked inside and showered I would feel the burn, but amazingly enough, I didn't burn! I haven't had this type of resistance to the sun since I was a child of about 10 years old vacationing in Florida without sunscreen. I'm not sure if everyone will experience this type of reaction, but it really makes me wonder how else this amazing fruit is benefiting my body in ways I cannot see!	2015-08-15

I was planning on just designating these as only work makeup but I find myself wearing them basically all the time. This color in particular I was expecting to be a bit prettier.

I didn't experience any breakouts nor did it clear up any acne but my face texture is super smooth and even instead of the usual patchy, peely, sensitive skin I have. My mom uses some sticky wrinkle stuff and it helped with her facial lines. Also the blue and silver squishy things are excellent. Definitely would buy again. Also the AM/PM cream is not greasy (I have combo skin as well) and only requires a super tiny bit.

Good for dry skin	This is labeled an anti-aging cream, but it doesn't have the ingredients like retinol that are normally associated with wrinkle removal. Instead I think the benefit is that it is a really nice moisturizer.<br /><br />This goes on feeling very heavy and I initially worried that it would be greasy on my face for a long time. But it absorbed in quickly and left my face feeling soft but not greasy. I think it would be good for dry skin. This is the kind of moisturizer you might want to start before wrinkles are an issue, just to keep you skin in good condition.  But because Sun is a big part of aging, be aware there is no SPF so you'll need some Sun protection.	2015-08-15

I started noticing lines on my d&eacute;colletage that I knew was from age, but I was surprised since I've been using sunblock for 30 plus years, I don't sunbathe or expose my skin to the sun without sunblock, so why was I getting these lines? I use skin creams religiously too, and nothing was making a difference in these lines. I put this on one night and by the morning my lines were barely visible! I couldn't believe it! I used it for several weeks and the lines are pretty much gone. The cons: the adhesion wears away quickly, it had not been a full month before the edges were rolling up; I like to apply moisturize on my chest at night and cannot apply any lotion before putting this on; I occasionally sleep on my side and I could not while wearing this thing. I only bought one, and haven't gotten another yet, but I'm sure once I see the lines return I'll be re-purchasing.	2015-08-15

It contains all the elements I have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer.  It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  It has three heat settings and two blower speeds.  I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed.  It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.<br /><br />It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  I once ruined a dryer because I didn't realize I needed to clean the filter.  Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the &#34;wrong way&#34; through it to clear dust that accumulates through time.  I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out.  I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it.  It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.<br /><br />The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice.	2015-08-15

It is a bit uncomfortable to use the first time, but it gets easier.  If you can get a tattoo, you can easily use this thing.<br />What I'm glad it has: The exfoliation brush is really useful.  It keeps me from getting ingrown hairs and makes my legs even smoother.<br />What I wish it had: It would be nice if there was a suction cup holder for the shower.  If I use it in the shower, I have to turn off the water in order to put it on the floor outside the shower without flooding my bathroom.<br /><br />I spent about two weeks researching epilators and reading hundreds of reviews and finally decided on the Braun Silk-epil 9.  It has a big head, different attachments that are useful, and can be used wet or dry.  I noticed that a lot of reviewers got it free, so I went to the BzzAgent site they reference, took some surveys, and thanks to my good karma, they sent me one to try out!  Score!  As soon as I got it, I scanned the instructions and held my breath as I held it up to my shin.  I was worried it was going to be really painful, but it was just like a rubber band snap.  It was a little uncomfortable, but not bad.  As I got closer to my ankles, it hurt a little bit, but nothing too bad.<br /><br />So, after successful use on my legs, I got cocky and decided to do my upper lip.  I put on the other cap and brought it up to my upper lip.  Oh mother of pearl!  I couldn't do it.  I've never waxed my lip and wasn't prepared for it.  Not sure if you remember the first time you plucked your eyebrows, but it was a similar sensation.  My eyes watered and I couldn't go through with it.  I went online and did some research and saw that some people used lidocaine cream to numb the area.  I tried that on my upper lip and bikini line and didn't feel a thing.  I've been using the exfoliating brush and haven't had any ingrown hairs.  I've use the epilator a few more times since and it's really not been bad at all.<br /><br />One word of caution:  Ifyou have bug bites on your legs, be careful.  I didn't realize that this little hair puller could also cut skin if it's swollen from a bug bite.  That's why I gave it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with this epilator.  I was completely prepared to buy it and, had I bought it instead of being awarded it, would have kept it.  I have no desire to go back to shaving, razor burn, and nicks on my legs!	2015-08-15

Let me tell you my story.<br /><br />A few months ago I bought a new product made with charcoal (won't mention the brand or name) and it was formulated to minimize pores. I didn't use it until this past week. The mentioned face wash BURNED my skin. My cheeks, chin and forehead were on fire. My skin was cracked, red, itchy, swollen and EXTREMELY dry. I tried using moisturizer, aloe vera, Vaseline... EVERYTHING was hurting my skin even more.<br /><br />A friend told me about Bio-Oil and I decided to give it a try. Immediately after the first application my skin felt so much better. As I was massaging the oil into my skin I could feel the peeled skin coming off. My face wasn't feeling itchy anymore, and the dryness disappeared immediately. It only took 2 applications of this oil to make my skin heal almost completely.<br /><br />Now I use it on a daily basis, two times a day (morning and night) and my skin has never felt so healthy. This is the best product I've ever tried, and trust me, I've tried A LOT.	2015-08-15

Unfortunately i did not like the scent of this lavender.  It does smell funky to me.  I am not sure if it is simply because it is a different type of lavender or if it is a poor quality oil.  I did do the splotch test on paper along with two other brands of lavender oil i have, but this brand along with one of the others left marks after hours of having put the drops on the paper.  To my understanding this means that there is another oil mixed with the essential oil to make this oil stain, as essential oils are not supposed to leave an oil stain but evaporate.	2015-08-15

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Stopped an Infection in 3 days! I am sold.	As anyone who has read my reviews knows, I am a natural health consultant and I use essential oils in many of my health related applications. Normally, I use tea tree in my nightly face moisturizer (that is DIY) and in some minor scraps and burn treatments. In the past few days though my husband had a horrible toe infection and there was no way we could get in to see a doctor since most were booked solid.<br /><br />I decided to use the First Botany Tea Tree on his toe. We used it for three nights in his epsom salt foot soak and two drops directly on his toe on the infection. It cleared up within 3 days. There is no more infection and he has no more pain.<br /><br />This is something that I have tried with other tea tree oils in the past, but this is the first time the results were so quick.<br /><br />I have to give a 5 star to First Botany and say it will be the brand we grab when it comes to first aid and Tea tree oil remedies.<br /><br />(I need to note that I did receive this bottle from the company to review)	2015-08-15

I have very long and thick hair. I can't just put any flimsy clips into my hair and get it to actually hold. I could tell by looking at these Alligator Clips that they were the kind I needed to hold my hair. I decided that they were at least worth trying. I get tired of having to wear my hair up only in a ponytail holder because of its thickness and length.<br /><br />My clips arrived yesterday. They actually got here a couple of weeks sooner than I was expecting and that's never bad. As soon as I opened them I was off to the bathroom to test out my new hair clips and play around with new styles. There are 6 in a pack. There is a pink, orange, green, black, blue, and purple.These hair clips are made very good. They are plastic but they are strong. The clip has 2 different pieces that make up the alligator clip. The clear piece is made well to. It's the part that has the extra teeth on it that helps to hold your hair.<br /><br />I am so happy I got these hair clips. They hold my hair and in my hair so good. They aren't flimsy or poorly made. As I mentioned my hair is very long and thick. They hold my hair without any issues at all. They work good also on my little girls hair and she has fine hair. I am very happy I got these. It's hard for me to find good hair clips that will hold my hair.<br /><br />* I received this 6pk of Transparent Sectioning Plastic Alligator Clips at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-15

Initially, I had gotten this Trimmer after reading a glowing review by an outlet(I don't remember the name of the site) that stated that out of all the trimmers they had tried, this was the most consistent. That is unfortunately not the case. The Trimmer does indeed woke fine and and comes with a variety of ways to style your facial hair, it does occasionally chug when trimming. The motor doesn't seem to be nearly as strong as the review had implied. Perhaps it's due to my own thick facial hair, but if you're looking for a Trimmer that won't pull on your hair, you may want to look elsewhere.	2015-08-15

It doesn't leave any sort of residue or glossy whiteness behind - it absorbs completely into skin. The packaging seems sturdy and portable - I wouldn't worry about it popping open while traveling - especially since the dispensing hole is very small so it won't come out in huge globs. Will definitely be adding this one to the daily routine!<br /><br />Before this I was using Sephora's SPF 15 moisturizer but not only did it pill under my foundation but it turned out to be pretty much all moisturizer and no sunscreen.

A hot omega 48 brush, tapped slightly dry, with less than a teaspoon of this rich soap yielded the best lather I have ever had with a minimum of effort. Even after first pass, enough stayed on my face for some quick touch ups. I was able to use the remaining lather in my mug for a second application, and decided to go for an atg shave, with great results. I'm often a victim of razor burn and in growns, however, after a splash of witch hazel and a cold towel, and I found myself without either.<br />I would highly recommend this product.	2015-08-15

The workmanship and handle material is not even close quality wise, yet it shaves side by side with the original. I bought it to give to my step father in law who loves to experiment with his shaves; but, won't spend anything on it. His 40 cent disposables will have to step aside for this and a blade assortment I also have for him. He loves the brush I got him and the soaps and creams I have sampled to him. He has even noted the location of a high end shave shop near his location.<br /><br />It is a midrange razor on aggressiveness. Perhaps a bit to the mild side of the midpoint. It is positioned to be usable for most shavers. Very mild and very aggressive razors are suitable for much smaller groups as too many shavers object to their lack of ability to get the stubble (too mild) or because they too easily cut and scuff the face (too aggressive).	2015-08-15

I do not really use toners, but I do use serums and moisturizers. I did not realize that a toner would help with the absorption of serums and moisturizers until I read the product description for this toner. I notice a difference now that I am using this toner. Not only do my serums moisturizers absorb much better, but my skin also has a more even skin tone. This toner helps tighten my pores and clear my acne. It also dries up any excess oil that I have, especially around my nose. I only use it once a day though, because of the drying effect it has on my skin. I have used glycolic skin products before and I love the way it works on my skin, but I do have to be careful not to overdo it because my skin can get dry. This toner feels very refreshing on my face when I apply it and has a pleasant floral scent. I have sensitive skin and I have not experienced any skin irritation since using this toner. I received this toner at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-15

I have used African Black Soap for years, first due to eczema, then because I just love it!  I obtained it from a local woman, who, sadly, passed away, and I had no idea where else to ge African Black Soap.  It was months before I discovered Suds of Beauty! The product is packaged nicely in a pink and white box.  When opening the box, you will find the large block of soap cut evenly and in a plastic bag.  I took the block and cut it into four even rectangles (the soap is SOFT).  Each rectangle I then placed in plastic wrap.  Three of them were put into a container and refrigerated for future use.  The fourth went in a draining soap dish for my enjoyment!  This soap gives lots of lather using just a bit.  I wet a cloth, rub the bar and have enough lather to clean from my face to my toes.  Using so little, I am sure this one pound will last a long while.  It has the cleanest smell--not perfumey--naturally clean.  I have, on occasion, used African Black Soap as a hair shampoo.  African Black Soap rinses COMPLETELY, leaving no residue on your body or hair.  After rinsing, rub a finger across your shoulder and feel the squeaky clean!  Your hair too--it will squeak cleanly.  African Black Soap doesn't leave any residue in the tub either, making it easy to clean.  I am glad I found Suds of Beauty and will be a repeat customer.	2015-08-15

He agreed to let it grow out some because I liked it a bit longer, but only if he could keep it well groomed. He tried gel, which flaked, he tried hair spray, which made his soft hair feel like straw, and finally he tried a pomade that he really liked- then they stopped making it. Which started a 2 year search for a new pomade. We have tried all sorts of products, mass produced, small companies, some very expensive brands and after all that- this is the winner.<br /><br />His hair is very thick, very straight and very soft. He likes to wear it slicked back- and this is the product that works for him. It can be recombed, which is very important in his job. It has fantastic hold. It doesn't flake, dry, or get crunchy. He loves the smell. It works on damp or dry hair. He's been using it happily for a couple of years now.<br /><br />He's also likes Lockhart's Medium Hold and Heavy Hold- but this is his favorite. He likes it better than the pomade he was using before!	2015-08-15

At first I was really satisfied with this lip concealer but after a day or two it ends up looking really nasty. It still works well but just breaks off and to apply it well you need a lip brush or to dab it on with your fingers. If you try to apply it like a lipstick way too much product will come off. So while it does work with the methods I said before I'd prefer a product that has better quality.	2015-08-15

Oz	AMAZING!!!! If I were to pick an EO that my family couldn't live without, I think would be Lavender! There are so many uses for this oil that it has become an essential in our daily life! Essential Oil is good for : Relaxing, Sleep Aid, Cuts and Burns, Insect Bites, Dandruff, Cold Sores and the list goes on! We use lavender in our diffuser each and every day in at least one of the rooms in our home...it helps ease my extreme anxiety and keep moods calm and relaxed. I also use this lavender essential oil for its fabulous scent! I add a few drops to my dryer balls, my toilet paper rolls, as well as in the bath bombs, soap, carpet powder. deodorant and laundry detergent that I make!<br /><br />I highly recommend doing research on lavender essential oil and seeing what it can do for you! Our lives have improved so much since adding essential oils into our home and health/body care. We are healthier and living more conscientiously, and that makes me feel good!<br /><br />This particular oil is a VERY nice large size and unlike a lot of the larger sized oils I have purchased in the pas,t it comes with a very nice dropper as opposed to the cheap pipettes other companies offer. This is a very nice quality EO and is such a great value for the size. I truly recommend this Lavender EO and this particular company as well...everything I have received from them has been very high quality and has been above and beyond my expectations. I was sent this EO to test out in our home and these opinions are entirely my own.	2015-08-15

These Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent, just like the rest of the Yes to Coconuts line. These are great facial wipes -- but can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn't enough time to shower. I use them occasionally instead of washing my face, since these are the fastest and easiest way to clean your face. These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can. My skin is often sensitive but there were no issues with these wipes. The wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. They are made in the USA. These wipes are highly recommended!!  I prefer the scents of the Yes to Cucumber/Coconut wipes much more than that of the Yes to Grapefruit wipes. If you're looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.	2015-08-15

It made my skin super soft. I warmed the mud in the microwave like the bag recommends and then put it on my face and body and let it sit for about 20 minutes. I also concentrated some on my ankle that was recently sprained and I broke several years ago. Dead Sea mud has a history of helping to increase blood flow and increase secretion of substances suppressing inflammation. I hope the mud helps my ankle, I will say that it felt great and I can't wait to use it again.  I am glad to see that I can buy mud from Amazon when I use all the mud my son brought me since I don't see any available in the USA.	2015-08-15

I only gained a few blonde strands. After rinsing the solution out, I've noticed a big increase in straw-like feel. It felt more dead than ever, more dead than bleaching it. My hair became harder and tangly. About 2 centimeters of my tips actually turned blond. Even after that, the blond is still not very apparent. And I feel that the orange parts actually turned MORE orangey. But, I felt like it was my fault and I think I added too much developer (Wella 20 v developer). Service was great though!	2015-08-15

My teeth are fairly white teeth but they could definitely be whiter. When I was offered a free sample of the product from Crest, I decided it was time to do a bit of research. I read other reviews and asked around if anyone had used a Crest whitening product. Most everything I heard was positive, so I agreed to try out the free sample. I am so glad I did. When I first received the product I read the instructions and the warning printed on the package to watch out for irritation and discomfort from using the product. I did experience some minor discomfort in my gums about a week in. However, I took a few days off from this toothpaste and when returning to it, the discomfort was gone. I have used the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System now for about a month. My teeth are definitely whiter and the toothpaste alone is a great product. My teeth feel clean all day long and the whitener has turned my pretty smile into a fabulous smile. #GotItFree	2015-08-15

(170ml)	Beauty	4	5	6	N	Y	Used for Lotion Masks	I have sensitive, combo Asian skin.<br /><br />This product didn't make my skin breakout so I'm happy about that.  I purchased it to use as a lotion mask as described in The Japanese Skincare Revolution book.  (I don't remember if any particular products were recommended by the author.)  I haven't noticed any significant improvement in texture, moisture, or clarity using this product or doing the lotion masks so I doubt I'll purchase this again.<br /><br />Just an FYI that the product arrived in a pouch not a bottle.  (Think of a juice pack like Capri Sun.)  Make sure you have a bottle handy to pour the lotion into because the pouch is not resealable.  Once you open it you will need to dispense it into a container.  I purchased this from Value's Japan so I'm not sure if other sellers would send it in a bottle and not the pouch.	2015-08-15

It says it will last a week And give us a week and blackheads will be gone!! Ok I poured each of thes into air tight containers. Mixed them up. There are 3 packets. First you use a medicinal smelling one then the second one is massage and smells like milk a bit and the third is scrub it is yellow like tumeric. Well all three have lasted a week And after two days my blackheads were gone. I will be repurchasing these amazing herb packets. Nothing and I nothing cleared my blackheads out like this package of 3 different herbs did. My nose is so happy. No more pulling with biore strips that didnt work all the way or charcoal. This stuff is magic. Even the deep ones are gone!! Love...update I got a second pack. My husband runs from the smell lol. It's an herb in the first mask. I love the smell. It smells like tea tree oil to me. I am in love with this kit. I actually do see a difference in my skin. I cant believe that this kills black heads :-) I just cant believe how well these really really work !	2015-08-15

Also, I feel like every time I use this cream in the winter time my foundation sits better on my skin and it doesn't settle into smile and fine lines.

I was able to get the 33 oz size on Amazon for the same price I was paying for the 16 oz size at the grocery store.<br /><br />I've read other reviews with people complaining about a formula change.

The Remington D8700 fits great in my hands and feels like a solid dryer with good material (it's still mostly plastic). It comes with a diffuser, brush (a very nice heavy one!), and concentrator. I use it without any attachments and it dries my thick hair fairly quickly, three minutes -- maybe? There are a few level selections and heat options. I definitely recommend it for anyone not sure what to get, it meets all of the basic needs and seems like it will last a long time.	2015-08-15

So I bought this after seeing one of my favorite YouTubers talk about this on a couple of (unsponsored) videos. She has AMAZING skin when she takes her makeup off so I decided to try it.<br /><br />It's a Korean skincare product. I get that but I thought that since the main label was in English that it would have some English directions as well. I got excited when I saw &#34;lift here&#34; on the label. Ummmmmm needless to say I had no idea what to do with this! Lol<br /><br />Let me back up a little. This smells pretty good and the smell fades after you apply it. It's a slimey consistency. I've applied it with both a foundation brush and my fingers, I prefer the fingers.<br /><br />I reache out to AlexisJayda (the YouTuber that raves about this stuff) and asked her. Before she answered, I had applied it to my face after my serums and moisturizers. It just had a sticky kinda feeling. I didn't care too much because you do wash it off in the morning.<br /><br />When she replied (I was totally fangirling!!!!) she told me that she uses this as her 1st layer after she washes her face at night, then she applies all of her other products. I tried it that way and it absorbed into my skin so nicely!<br /><br />I can say that my skin is really soft and feels nice when I use this. I'm just not sure about the other benefits yet, I don't think I've been using it long enough.	2015-08-15

SCHOLLS ONE STEP CORN REMOVER 1045 1 EACH	Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	It worked for me -My corn was from wearing ill-fitting shoes-	Not all corn removers are created equal.  This one worked for me.  There are several versions of this product.  The one I purchased was from Walmart.  I was going to purchase if from Amazon but I was reading some of the reviews and was not sure if this was the product for me.  When I went to Wally World to do my weekly shopping, I notice that the item was on rollback and had a coupon attached.  The item I purchased was in a blue and white box and next to it was this box (red and yellow).  I can only assume that the product has had a face-lift because the UPC on both boxes were the same but the blue and white box had the coupon affixed to it (so I took advantage of the coupon and rollback price.  The exp date was good until 2016-sold). Moving on -the UPC: 10450 is in the right-hand corner of the box.  The UPC on the back of the box is: 11017-104-50...Folks... This item worked for me.  My corn was from wearing ill-fitting shoes. My footwear was too loose, and my foot would repeatedly slide and rub against the inside of shoe and the seam or stitch inside the shoe (New Balance). The pain was awful.  I tried Mosco One Step Corn Remover Pads - They did not work for me.  I thought I would just have to live with the pain. I used 2 of the bandages and in no time it just popped off.  There are not instructions so here is how I used it.  After shower...I applied the bandage- carefully open the package along the top seam to keep from ripping the bandage itself (tip from the hubby).  Pull  the full bandage out then remove the clear backing slowly...to avoid pulling the medicated center piece off.<br />This is not like a band-aid (the backing is a strip of plastic) and the bandage will not be flat.. the dark center piece must stay attached ..that is where the medicine is.. the white cushion around the dark center must also stay affixed as you pull the backing from the bandage.  Place the bandage over the affected area.  Allow the dark spot to lay on the actual corn and the whitecushion will cover the skin around the corn... then lay the side strips down and you are ready to go.  Depending on how bad the corn is determines how many times you will need to repeat the process.  The bandage is very, very strong.  I was hard to get off even after a shower to change it out.  After the second bandage...my corn just popped right off.<br />Hope this helps someone.  Oh and my total cost was --ready????  $2.00 due to rollback and coupon....Happy dance!!!	2015-08-15

Girl Matte Flat Finish Pigment Gloss	Beauty	3	1	1	N	Y	Okay Product	Was hoping to be a economic alternative to the KVD everlasting lips or ABH liquid lips.<br />Okay color. The color was a bit less orange. Defiantly more of a peachy pink color. The texture itself was disappointing.<br />When it dries, it doesn't dry completely, leaving it slightly sticky. When you have to retouch after a meal or something, it only makes it thicker and stickier.<br />Somewhat of an uneven application, but is forgiving.<br /> Extremely difficult to take off, even with makeup removing wipes.<br />I wouldn't wear this every day simply because of the texture.	2015-08-15

This soap clears up my pimples fast and makes my face smooth with a nice glow. Not sure about the whitening effects but my face looks a lot younger and moisturized after washing.

They make it so quick and easy to clean your face! These are great  -- and can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn't enough time to shower. Sometimes my sensitive skin gets red or breaks out from products, but I have had no problems with these wipes, with occasional use. The scent is a clean, fresh tea tree oil smell. They are made in Israel. These wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. These wipes are highly recommended!!  The Yes to Cucumber face wipes have a refreshing cucumber scent, while the Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent and are also worth considering. If you're looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.	2015-08-15

I have given up standard shampoos given their chemical and detergents. this one isn't 100% chemical free but I use it only once every 10 days for a deep clean! My hair is also super fine so using too often makes my hair feel a bit dry. It's a super pampering experience which you really have to follow the instructions and take your time to fully appreciate the benefits. Your hair comes out like silk, gently yet deeply cleansed, smelling amazing and fresh and your scalp feels invigorated. I love all of CR's line but this one is definitely a key product.

I used to use the lotion many years ago, then switched to St. Tropez mousse because it dried faster and looked more natural after you just put it on. This spray on liquid is actually the best so far. The color is great -- it is brown (with red in it) so it looks very natural on a fair person with freckles like me. When you are really white it can be hard not to look orange, but this stuff does the trick. I wear it year round, and people are always saying things about me being naturally olive skinned. Yeah right. My only complaint is that I wish it would stay on longer. A good amount of it comes off after showering.	2015-08-15

No animals were harmed in the making of this product because it was not tested on animals! It is all natural and organic and is jam packed with all the best ingredients to work wonders on your skin! It can also be used in combination with other vitamin C or skin care products, but I am not sure that it is necessary since this has so many key components to making your skin look and feel healthy!<br /><br />This serum is in an easy to use pump bottle. It comes out a little thicker than many serums, so a little will go a long way. It is a very creamy looking, yellow serum that absorbs into your skin very quickly. This serum does so much for the skin, you almost cannot believe it.<br /><br />It clears skin of blemishes. All blemishes can be improved with this one serum. It not only cleans out pores, but it clears skin. It reduces redness, repairs scars, and prevents breakouts. It soothes skin, and helps to smooth skin out by plumping and hydrating wrinkles and fine lines. It not only protects you from UV but reverses sun damage already done to the skin. I love that it can be used for teens, adults and the elderly. It can be used by both men and women. It is completely versatile and productive. You will notice a difference in your skin when using this product. I use it three times a week and my husband uses it twice a week. We both are noticing healthier, better and younger looking skin!<br /><br />This product is made in the USA and is backed with a full refund guarantee in the instance that you are not satisfied.	2015-08-15

Just jump in the shower, lather up, rinse and jump into your onesie coveralls and you're ready to go.<br /><br />The stuff lathers well and does a good job of cleaning.  I found the scent very manly and even if you don't like it that much it dissipates quickly. Inexpensive enough to give a try anyway.	2015-08-15

I have used this bombilla for about a year with no problems or issues. It does a great job of filtering Yerba Mate and other loose leaf teas and herbs.

However it still very easy to clean by running water though it backwards. I will buy more of this brand.	2015-08-15

I take my makeup off. it doesn't take all of my makeup completely off as I can see some foundation on a cotton ball when I wipe my face with astringent. I use this because it doesn't burn my skin or make it sting as regular makeup remover wipes do because of the alcohol content. It's sensitive enough for me, and it works for now until I can find a more effective makeup remover/skin cleansing wipe.	2015-08-15

I was given samples of the products and in that week I wasn't disappointed. I bought the travel packet because it contained everything I needed to try the product for a longer period of time without breaking the bank. All the items in the package were sealed and the quality of them was the same as the samples and the items used at the spa. I've battled with my acne skin and this product is now my only regemine I'll use on my face. People at work and my boyfriend have made comments on how they see a difference in my face. It works for me and is worth the money for the large size bottles.	2015-08-15

I received this lovely product after getting it as part of a Bzzkit from Bzzagent.  Like many of you, I've used many different types of deodorant in my day.  I like that this product does exactly as advertised.  It goes on smooth, clear and lasts.  I wore this to work in a hospital and even on a day it was 95 to help someone move.  At the end of those days, taking my shirt off to get in the shower, I could smell the scent from the deodorant, not sweat.  I even put it to the true test on a stretch of five days off work.  I got up, took a shower, put this on and then skipped the shower the next day.  It works.  I continued without nasty underarm sweating and no odor.  When I showered the following day, I still could smell the product.  This stuff works. Even better, I wear a lot of black so it was nice not seeing white streaks on my clothes. I'm rating 4 stars though because my only criticism I can offer is a big deal for me, it feels damp when it goes on as most gels tend to do and I had to let it dry before putting clothes on because that feeling makes me crazy and it's more a personal quirk than criticism.  I just don't like feeling wet under there.	2015-08-15

I'll keep the comb because you can't really return these things once you've used them, but, in my opinion, the teeth are too far apart to do anything with it.

It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don't rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. My only criticism with this razor is it is difficult to clean when soap scum builds up. There are a lot of nooks and crannies that are hard to get to. Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value. Highly recommended!	2015-08-15

Don't get anything else, this is the real deal.<br />I used a 4 fl oz bottle in a 32 oz spray bottle (mixed with water). Water and this oil won't mix but shake your bottle and the mixture becomes milky and ready to be used - I spray around the house for a fresh scent and an immediate insect repellent. I used to have flies coming in the  house. God knows why as my house is hyper-clean and from where they come (vent? chimney?) but I had one or two a day, enough to bug me (punt intended) making me jump to the spray chemicals. Since I stated to spray peppermint (and no more than once or twice a week), they don't come anymore. And yes, they do seem to also repel spider as advertised as I did not spot a &#34;corner&#34; web for a while.<br />Next usage is a few drop in a fresh glass of water. The provided glass dropper is perfect to make the measure - what a refreshing drink with immediate soothing effects! I am thrilled with the taste and freshness but also the effect as your body absorbs it - after a heavy meal or on boated days, it helps for real and you feel relaxed and calm.This brand is simply fantastic. I will buy it again I am sure (and so sold in this that I am now likely to try their other products)	2015-08-15

Great product. I work a lot with my hands around the house and I used to bite my nails, so they are very weak and chip easily. After just one day of applying this cream (I did the recommended regiment of 3 applications per day), my nails were already feeling stronger. Now, after only a few days of applications, my nails feel MUCH harder (they hardly bend at all), and even my flimsy, chipped nail on my thumb is feeling stronger than ever. I highly recommend this product because it works well and begins working right away.<br /><br />I love that the scent of the cream is very light and subtle, so it feels like I am applying nice hand lotion when I use it. I also love that you can use the cream over painted nails, because I always have my nails polished.<br /><br />Hard As Hoof nail strengthening cream works, is easy and neat to apply, and very convenient to use! I highly recommend purchasing it.	2015-08-15

When I saw these were available online, I was thrilled because I really like Brocato but hadn't used them in awhile because of the inconvenience of special ordering them through a salon. However, the shampoo and conditioner don't smell or work like the stuff I used to get through my old salon. I mentioned it to my current stylist today, and she said people buy the bottles and put whatever they want in them to sell - so you never know what it is you're putting on your hair. Yikes.  Basically, she said any professional hair products not bought through a reputable salon are likely counterfeit. While I realize it's in her best interest to keep people ordering through the salon, I'm inclined to believe her because I noticed the difference before talking to her. I won't be ordering any more online.	2015-08-15

It has become a favorite and have been using it a few times per week. It is much thicker than what I'm used to in a mud mask, but it leaves my skin so soft and tight. It actually smells pretty good, too! As I place it on, it becomes softer to smooth around my face. I cover almost my entire face and within five minutes, it hardens up.

Hope that doesn't happen with Fat Hair, don't know what I'd do without it. A side note; a friend tried this and it didn't work on her hair.  So, it is an individual thing, but at least give it a try, hopefully it will work for you.	2015-08-15

I was a little leery about trying this product as the idea of goo under my arms wasn't sounding very helpful to me.  Thankfully, I've been pleasantly surprised!  This product has worked just as well as my other stick deodorant. Although it says unscented, there is a slight fragrance to it albeit very slight and not at all noticeable once it dries.<br />My biggest complaint about this product is the residue it leaves.  Maybe I'm putting too much on but it's very hard to wash off and leave residue on my clothes.  Many of my summer shirts now have residue on the inside armpits that refuse to wash off.  You can't see it from the outside but I hate knowing it's there.<br />Other than that, I'm a fan of this product.  For the price on Amazon, you can't beat it!	2015-08-15

WOW, ok I love this stuff. my circles are fading. not being covered but fading. its not instant but its only been a few weeks and I can see the difference. also the fine lines are so much finer. this works so well under makeup, im having a lot less problems with creasing under eye makeup. all I gotta say is this is it, THE LAST EYE GEL, ill ever buy. this is holy grail status for under eyes. its affordable, it works, it feels amazing and I love it. I've been trying a lot more from instanatural and I gotta say they do not disappoint. this brand is truly amazing. and thankfully it doesn't have all the nasty chemicals (that break me out) best skin care! best value! best brand!	2015-08-15

Packaged in a 4 ML pump bottle. Using the pump is a bit tricky as the first time or two you use it, the pump is stiff and it &#34;splashes&#34; everywhere, while trying to just get a couple drops on the palm of your hand. I wish I could see a list of all ingredients and the label is smeared quite a bit and a few letters even missing. Here it is the best I can read it.<br /><br />Purified water, soy and rice peptides, hyaluronic acid, Halxylz, roobos tea, Tripeptide-5, vegetable glycerin, sunflower oil, emulsi (can't read last part of word), macadamia oil, rose hip oil, vit E, Vit A, phenoxyethanol, and fragrance.<br /><br />I really like the feel and softness of my eye area after using this. It has really helped the texture of my skin and the bags under them. I feel a very slight firming when it is drying. You want to use just one little pump which is very little, it goes a long ways, It is an off white in color, no real smell I can detect. I think the fine lines are a bit better also, but things won't happen over night I know.<br /><br />I do wish it was a bigger bottle and had a dropper instead of a spray. It also does burn if you do get it in your eye by accident. I washed it out and it didn't burn long, but for something I am going to put that close to my eye, I wish it wouldn't burn. Those are the only reasons I took off a star.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

Absorbs Quickly!	I am loving the bee naturals nail and cuticle oil. It comes in an adorable package with a tiny bee on it that really encompasses their brand. It is also cruelty free which is a major plus! There are few ingredients in it and mostly consists of natural and essential oils. I love the scent. It is light and to me there is a hint of citrus. The brush that is included and attached to the bottle makes application easy. It seems like it will last a very long time as just one dip of my brush does one and a half hands. The oil itself absorbed quickly and was not sticky in any way. This oil left my fingers feeling very soft and nourished!

This item appears great on the photo and has a convincing description, but this seems to be a mom and pop concoction that is frankly not ready for the main stage with the established body butters/lotions.  First, the scents are weak and do not seem to mesh like other lotions using the same scents.  Rosemary and peppermint should get my nose as soon as I open the jar, but also not leave me gagging like some athletic cream.  The application is a greasy enough to pass as lotion, and maybe to grease a hog at the county fair, but I do not think it is fair to promote this product for much more than that.  I imagine a light and lingering smell for a reasonable period of time, but this is simply Crisco at the disco.  One last thing, the product should match the product label and advertisement because the Amazon.com listing states Rosemary Peppermint Body Butter, however the package says Rosemary Peppermint Foot Rub  8 oz.  The labels themselves are printed from a home computer and applied via a piece of tape, which is frankly not professional for an item that is sold for the human body.  I don't want to buy a kitchen brew, but a quality, safe, professional lotion.    Update: I was likely too harsh and thus I have eliminated a large portion of my review and updated my rating level.	2015-08-15

Wet and Dry Brushing	Beauty	5	0	0	N	Y	these are too perfect for do it yourselfers like me	I couldn't see spending that kind of money on the expensive battery operated facial cleansing brushes, these are too perfect for do it yourselfers like me.  the soft brush, to use wet, really removes makeup at the end of the day, and refreshes in the morning before you put on makeup new.  Use your normal cleanser and a circular motion on your skin, it is marvelously refreshing. the dry brush to use on dry skin (gently of course) also gives pleasant results, but the wet brush is what makes the purchase a no-brainer.	2015-08-15

I did not know that these are EMORY BOARDS, I ordered what I believed were going to be nail FILES.  In additional to them being improperly named (in my opinion), I was fooled by the colors.  I have seen glass/ceramic nail files many times with the bright and graduated rainbow colors, so I believed that these were just like them.  I've never seen multicolored emory boards before.  Finally, they are really, really thick and I don't know how it would be possible to file the corner edges of my nails into the slightly rounded shape I prefer without damaging the skin on the tips of my fingers.  This is the first Tweezerman product I have EVER felt that wasn't a 5 star product.  I really hope it the last.	2015-08-15

Owned the original for 10 years before the wall plug crapped out and broke. It was the &#34;BEST&#34; hair trimmer I ever owned and I was pretty upset and disappointed when it broke! Afterwards, I bought 10 other trimmers ranging from $25 to $100 trying to find one that cut as close and clean as the Remington one did and came up 0 for 10! I wasted a TON of $$ and have a TON of knicks and micro cuts on my head from these other type of trimmers to prove my futility in finding a good clipper again!!  When I saw this new 2.0 version of my most favorite trimmer I swooped it up and just tested it out; it is EXACTLY THE SAME as my old one and I literally hugged and kissed it several times due to my happiness and joy!!  I have been buzzing my head for over 25 years and have literally spent hundreds on trimmers and clippers and have not found a single one that cuts and trims as close as this Remington does! I bought 4 more just in case so I should be set for life now!  In conclusion, I can't recommend this trimmer/clipper enough and would say order one and try it out and see why I am so giddy and happy about this product!	2015-08-15

After reading online reviews about this toner,  I  bought it. The product seems good to me as only after using it for two days, I am already seeing marked improvement. The pores are a bit smaller and the  face looks less oily (yes!). I hope my skin would further be improved. The only objection I have is the price $23 for 4 oz; if it was $23 for 6 or 7 oz , it would have been perfect. Anyhow I don't see any rival for this product in the market. This toner would be a very good addition to the skincare routine of any person with oily skin having enlarged pores.The performance of this product has compelled me to try other products from the manufacturer. Maybe I have found the brand which actually works (hope!).	2015-08-15

I selected this for my son who is attending college as it seems like he is always running late (his excuse) for no time to shave. Now with this inexpensive Foil shaver he can make himself more presentable by the time he arrives at school (he has a 30 minute commute!)  This works out great as that happens to be the battery life for this on a full charge. We plug it in when he gets home and it is ready to go when he leaves for school. While I would much rather he get up earlier and shave here at home this fills the need nicely. Also as a bonus I am savinga bunch $$ on disposable razor blades. For $20 this is a bargain! I am going to pick some up for my husband and our other boys for this Christmas's stocking stuffers this year.<br />*It also comes with the pop up trimmer which comes in hand for his sideburns and has a 60 Day Money Back Guarantee along with a 2 year Limited Warranty and it has a LED Charge indicator.	2015-08-15

Unfortunately, it wasn't even a contest. What I love about Pink Sugar is the vivid olfactory illusion of fresh, warm cotton candy and skin, making it a scent as grown-up and sexy as it is comforting and nostalgic. While Delicious Cotton Candy lists the same notes as Pink Sugar, almost word-for-word, I found it to be thin in comparison, lacking depth and dimension, and with a strange artificial berry-fruit note. It did smell sugary but at no point during the wear time did it become what I could call a warm or sexy scent.	2015-08-15

I order this regularly.  It is a great product which removes all residue of hair products from your hair.  I use it first and then shampoo with regular shampoo.  This allows the regular shampoo to do a better job after the Nioxin has dissolved hair spray, spritz, mousse, etc.  I originally purchased it after I read claims that it would stop hair loss with age.  That is a hard thing to gauge but I don't believe I have lost any additional hair since using Nioxin.  However, because of its cleansing ability I would continue to use it even if it didn't stop hair loss.	2015-08-15

Over the years my skin had become sensitive to all paraben based body soaps and washes. I broke out in hives using dove. So I knew after that that my skin had become super sensitive. I was raised to use organically whenever I could and Shea moisture just happened to be next to the Castile soap my grandmother had raised me on (which I'm also very allergic to) and after reading the ingredients I decided to get it and try it. First time it did leave my skin a tiny bit irritated but I added a few drops of lavender essential oil to the whole bottle and it cured all the itchies. Now I use it without the lavender oil and the greatest part about using organic, is that u can use it as a shampoo also. Or a shaving creme. It's multi purpose and a little bit (like dime size) to cover ur whole body in a nice lather and another dime for hair (mine was shoulder length when I started) and in 3 months my hair grew five inches. It protects hair from breakage and leaves it light and unburdened and clean. I even used it on my dog and it's safe for hypoallergenic pooches. Just doesn't kill fleas and stuff. As soon as I can find something that kills fleas ticks and eggs harshly yet is completely safe for my dog I plan on adding it to my favorite product. My dog deserves the best most organic stuff as much as I do. 5 stars all the way.	2015-08-15

Ok so I am a skeptic when it comes to any towel not leaking water when my hair is wrapped. I have very thick long hair, slightly wavy but not at all curly.  No matter what towel I wrap my hair in, it becomes soaked, and so does anything I lean against. . My hair generally take hours to air dry, especially if in a ponytail. Not only did this Curly Tee Drying Towel not leak any water, it remained almost totally dry to the touch. I decided not to blow dry my hair. Instead I kept it in the towel when I went to bed several hours later. The towel was dry, but hair was still somewhat wet inside the towel at night and totally dry by morning. Pillow stayed dry all night.  Awesome!	2015-08-15

So far, I am liking this very much.  A little dab goes a long way, and it's not overly dry or overly moist texture makes it easier to spread on. It does not feel or smell synthetic to me. I use it mainly on my neck and decolletage because that is where the sun has damaged me the most.  I still have hypopigmentation (white dots) there.  Instead of powder or liquid foundation, I use this.  I can see where it's covering until I blend it in to create a more natural skin tone; and I feel less scorched, if at all, when the sun hits me there. I wear long neck scarves that I can adjust during the day to assist against high sun exposure moments, but this sunscreen has also definitely shielded me against this hot Georgia summer.  So far, it's been a win-win and I don't see that changing.	2015-08-15

It makes me look away and fresh when I use it around my eyes. Also, works for scars and some moles.<br />UPDATE: Still using this. In the afternoon, my makeup starts to wear off a bit.

These blotting sheets are just okay.  They do not have the same texture as other oil absorbing sheets I have used and don't seem to do the job as well as others.

The color is very flattering and it feels good on your lips. The only thing I don't like is that, like many lip color products, the color migrates to the edge of my lips after a while and I have to reapply or wipe it off to avoid having a colored ring around my mouth (althought the color is quite sheer so it's not as bad as when lipstick does this). I do like that it is mostly natural also.	2015-08-15

Not for me	I did not like this product at all.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Moisturizing. My skin did feel really soft each time I removed it.<br />-Non-irritating ingredients.<br />-Decent price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Sunscreen ingredients sit on the skin. I could never get them to fully absorb into the skin. It just leaves a mask on my skin.<br />-Hard to rub in. First it seems watery out of the tub. I could never rub it in without it being streaky. It also dried quickly, which meant that the streaky look stayed on my skin. If I tried rubbing more, it would pill and fall off. All that rubbing hurt my sensitive cheeks.<br />-The white cast. I wore this the morning I got it. People asked me why I had cold cream on my skin.<br />-It cracked after drying. Even if I ended up without the uneven coverage and covered the whiteness with foundation, it would crack and rub off throughout the day.<br /><br />This was such a disappointment. I thought the good reviews meant it would be perfect for me. Three days was all I could put up with this. This experience shows that just because something works for others does not mean it will work for you.	2015-08-15

Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy.  It simply did not work for us, now my head itches every day and I've never had this problem before.  Another warning, the fumes are awful while applying the product.  We had all the windows open, fan blowing and we were sitting near the open door.  Our eyes were burning from the fumes and got a scratchy, nasty feeling in the throat.  It took us almost 4 hrs each to get through the entire procedure and of course we are very disappointed in wasting our time and money on this product.  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend products from this company to anyone.	2015-08-15

(I tested this by first using the face wipe, then toner on a cotton round, and there was still a bit of makeup left, as shown on the cotton.) Because of this, I do not use these daily, just when the convenience makes it worthwhile. These wipes did effective remove eye makeup and did not irritate my eyes, although I was very careful when using them around my eyes (and the package advises to avoid contact with eyes). The wipes have a pleasant enough smell, but I was a little disappointed because the Yes to Grapefruit scrub smells much better -- more fresh citrus scent. These Yes to Grapefruit wipes worked well for my combination skin, leaving it feeling soft and not sticky, as other versions of face wipes have done. By the way, these wipes also work well for a quick clean-up for the body and are refreshing, when showering isn't possible. The wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. They are made in Germany.  The Yes to Cucumber wipes have a nice cucumber scent and the Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent; I prefer these scents to the Yes to Grapefruit wipes. For better cleansing with a wipe than these &#34;Yes to&#34; variations, Blum's exfoliating wipes work well, because they have small beads that help clean (and also a great orange scent).	2015-08-15

I am in my early 30s and have noticed the crow lines around my eyes beginning to form so I was excited to begin to use this I have used several other products and thought why not true something more natural for skin instead. After a month of usage my skin seems more vibrant, wrinkles have become less visible.  Keep in mind they do not go away but they have slightly diminished.

I've been buying this for at least 6 years and its the best for spiking hair without running the risk of being impaled when your head reaches the pillow. That said, I bought some over a year ago and, like others, found that the formula had changed. I nearly despaired, but tried buying a 2-pack which turned out to be the original. Plain good luck? Since then I have only bought where its advertised in a multipack and they have always been the original formula. (At least 3 different sites.) I have no explanation for this, other than when customers buy I a single, somehow they are getting the latest stock. Perhaps multipacks were packaged before any changes were made to the formula. OR could it be that TIGI have finally come to their senses and gone back to what their customers loved? Nah!	2015-08-15

As a beginner straight razor user I knew very little about strops other than the youtube videos demonstrating how to use one. The number of reviews coupled with the favourable ratings convinced me to buy this strop despite the low price. I soon found out that the reviewers That rated this product know what they're writing about. All the symptoms were present. Hard leather, warping, &#34;cupping&#34; as one writer described in which the middle of the strop bellies vertically causing only the tip and end of the razor to touch. I thought this was expected so I went ahead and put my brand knew hart steel to the belt. I realized after a few shaves that this could not be normal. I will likely have to send my razor for honing. It gets one star since unlike other buyers, I don't have the patience to bring this strop to condition and therefore it's useless to me.	2015-08-15

For a gal with fine hair that's not a cute look. I doubt I'll purchase this product again because I don't feel it does what it says very well.	2015-08-15

It doesn't dry as fast as another product by banana boat. The pros though is it's mineral base and safe on kids. It also doesn't feel sticky. I usually will spread it all over after spraying as it doesn't come out even.  I love that it's mineral base and therefore gentle enough even for babies but the execution of this bottle just sucks and the fact that it's not fast drying/absorbing means you end up having to use your hands so I probably won't repurchase but if you have kids this is a great option.	2015-08-15

The smell of this Armani Code by Quality Fragrance Oils is true to the Armani scent. Being able to just roll it on and keep it in a contained area verse spraying it all over, though that not being the intention, is a great different way to add scent to yourself. It's nothing to empowering that you're trying to get away from the scent but cannot. My wife had gotten this for me in hopes that I would like it since I've used the same cologne for the longest of time and she's not too fond of it - just tolerates. With this, it's enjoyable by both her and eye. It last through my work day that at times I forget that I'm wearing it, but my wife does by saying &#34;Oooh, you're smelling good!&#34;. I like that it doesn't leave an oil like feeling on my skin that I can feel it - it's as though it's not even on me. I also like the fact that I am able to place it onto me and I don't have to worry about it getting onto my clothes. We did receive this at a discounted rate for our unbiased review. Our opinion was not influenced by the discount that we received.	2015-08-15

Bath and Body works has some of the most remarkable scents and aromas that I have ever had the pleasure of smelling and I am sure many would agree that they are industry leaders in the scents game.

I am very picky about what I put on my skin, as this is the body's largest detoxifier and I sure don't want to add toxins. As a rule, I would not like to put on my skin something I cannot eat, and this sure looks edible! In addition to castor, macadamia, rose hip, and other fine oils, the ingredients I am most impressed with include astaxanthin (which greatly reduces inflammation causing wrinkles), lycopene, lutein and alpha lipoic acid (all fine and natural antioxidants/nutrients).

The bottle itself was really nice and the pump is easy to use but the quality of the foundation just didn't work too well with my skin. The foundation came out nice and liquid out of the bottle but it dried pretty fast while I was still in the process of applying it. I usually put foundation on my hand and apply it with a brush from my hand. After the product was on my face, it set and changed color a bit. My face looked dry and felt dry. I had a moisturizer on prior to applying the foundation too, so it shouldn't have been this dry. I'm not a fan.<br />I tested the foundation out for free, but the opinion is all my own.	2015-08-15

I do like Dermalogica as a brand, it is a minimalist brand dedicated solely to skin improvement, no splashy packaging or scents. I used the entire supply. I thought there was no noticeable difference or improvement, so I decided not to re-purchase. After a couple of weeks I noticed that my skin was more dull,  less hydrated and definitely less lustrous. I had not noticed the gradual improvement until I stopped using it. I re-purchased and included it in my skin care regimen, every other night, and my skin looks great. This is not an overnight miracle, but if you're middle aged and fighting gravity and the inevitable dull complexion, this is the way. If you need a miracle you should see a dermatologist. If you're fighting the good fight, using age smart products, and religiously applying sun block, you need to continue regular mild exfoliation and hydration. When I apply this, then apply nightly moisturizer, my skin remains well-hydrated through the night. This product has earned it's space on my shelf! Love it!	2015-08-15

I have very dry skin, especially on my legs, all year round. I have used many different lotions from the stores that say they hydrate for 24 hours that just don't seem to cut it. I've even tried natural remedies like coconut oil but it never actually soaks into my skin and I can't put pants on right away. This stuff is magical! It actually soaks into my skin quickly, doesn't feel greasy or oily, and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. My skin feels so quenched and hydrated even a few hours after application which is very impressive. I have this dry patch on my left leg that I can never get to go away and ever since I started using this a week ago the dry spot has not bothered me at all. It has even taken the itch away from it. I can already tell that this body butter will be just what I need during the winter. I love the natural ingredients in this cream as well and the scent is very appealing. This has definitely become an instant favorite! *discount received for testing and review*	2015-08-15

Applying peppermint foot lotion to my feet is practically a daily thing for me. Between seasonally dry feet & being on my feet a lot during the day, this has become a part of my bedtime routine. I have tried many different brands of peppermint foot lotion over the years. This lotion is thick & creamy and has a light peppermint scent. I really like that there are lots of natural ingredients in it and that it's not tested on animals. The lotion does do a decent job of soothing tired feet. I would say it's better than a lot of the similar products out there. I personally like a stronger peppermint presence and one that leaves my feet tingling more than this one. However, for the price, I am pretty pleased. And because I go through so much peppermint foot lotion, I would definitely repurchase this one. Others in the same price range are not as good.	2015-08-15

Easy to set up and use	The SKG Facial Spray is a really clever and efficient little gadget. I review beauty products across quite a few websites and I can honestly say I have never come across anything like this electrically powered facial spray before.<br />'Steamer' is slightly misleading as it implies a heat-produced vapour; what this device does is dispense an ultra fine mist of water droplets - it's almost steam-like but it is water, rather than water vapour.<br />It arrived beautifully packaged in a silk lined presentation box.<br />The unit uses a rechargeable battery which charges via a mini USB to USB charger - so a USB charging point is needed to use this, either a computer or a mains USB charger. I left the unit to charge overnight and it was ready for use in the morning.<br />The unit is filled with water by sliding off a panel on the back, taking out a silicone plug and using the pipette supplied (or a mini funnel if you have one). Refitting the silicone plug was a little tricky, but not too fiddly.<br /><br />The unit is operated by simply sliding the front panel covering the spray downwards. It sprays instantly and continuously. The spray is very fine, but also very cooling - great to set makeup, or just to cool down.<br /><br />It's virtually noiseless in use, which is a big plus - you won't be annoying fellow passengers on public transport for example. It's very elegant in presentation and will look great in the bathroom or dressing table.<br />I received a sample to review without cost, this is my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-15
US	50421608	RY4UMKFLPJQU9	B00HFQQ0VU	311309827	Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser	Beauty	5	3	3	N	Y	Easy to handle & does the job.	Does everything it's advertised to do.  10 levels of intensity of pulsing water stream to choose from. You're also able to choose between gum massage or water flossing with the push of a button.  I see some people reviewing say it's difficult to remove the tip. Well, if you slide the side button up, the tip pops off instantly and easily. To re-attach, just slip it into the handle until it snaps in place. Doesn't get much easier than that.  I also read where the wand button is &#34;difficult&#34; to move.  When the unit is in the &#34;off&#34; mode, the button slides easily. When you turn it on, it's a tiny bit difficult because of the built up water pressure............but I didn't find it all that bad at all and don't understand what all the fuss is about. I slid the handle button on and off with minimal thumb pressure at setting 1 then dialed it up to 10. Once the water was gone, I was able to retract the handle thumb button easily.  Comes with a total of 7 attachments but no &#34;case&#34; to store them in. I did find that Amazon carries  the &#34; Waterpik Convenient Hygienic Sturdy Storage Case for Replacement Tips , 6 Count&#34;.  It's a tip storage case that comes with 6 tips--- 2 classic jets, 2 plaque seekers and 2 Orthodontic tips all for around 15 bucks.  They also sell just the case without any replacement tips for around 9 bucks.  The tips that come with this Storage case do fit the WP600,  as well as several other units Waterpik sells. For a full list of compatible units, go online to Waterpik for a complete list.<br />I highly recommend using warm water so it's not as big shock to your teeth, especially if you've got tooth sensitivity issues.	2015-08-15

I have tried a lot of organic/natural/eco brand deodorants over the years. I even tried alum crystals.

I almost gave up and switched back to the conventional deodorants because I was tired of smelling bad all the time.

I switched to using this as my facial moisturizer from the Cerave moisturizer in the tub and I've begun to much prefer this one to it.

I originally bought &#34;[[ASIN:B0049J7P3S The Brush Guard Variety Pack]]&#34; and started using for travel, so they got dirty.  I went to buy it again and found a more cost effective product!  Namely the &#34;BMC Cute Colorful 90pc Sheer Mesh Reusable Expandable Slip On Make Up Brush Guard Protectors Set&#34;  I was entranced by the colors, I won't lie.  But I found this to be a much better solution than the Brush Guard (sorry) and I probably will be using these for a long time.  Now it's not as sturdy as The Brush Guard, but it does the same exact thing, which is help me protect my brushes after washing and keep them upside down.  I find at the end it tapers off small which helps shape the brush.  It's a little weaker since you only see one plastic thread instead of 3 strands like The Brush Guard (when you expand it)...but it does the trick and perhaps helps air it out more since it's less covered in plastic.  (For those that don't understand what I mean, I'm trying to describe the &#34;weave&#34; which is stronger and more reinforced with The Brush Guard).  Technically speaking I do prefer The Brush Guard to this product, but not enough to pay more!  For those that have never tried The Brush Guard, disregard what I'm saying and just buy this product.  It comes with 90pcs, much more than you will need.  So I gave some to my sister.  Also what I didn't realize at first, is you can wash these if you use for travel and they get junky.  So get these now, you won't go wrong!	2015-08-15

Some people love certain smells other don't.<br /><br />I have not tried Mistral's other scents and would be open to trying, but....this soap, with everyone I have asked to smell it, has a very distinctive and disagreeable smell.  It smells like a NURSING HOME.  Extremely hard to explain any other way that I can think of.  The quality of the soap itself seems high (which is why I would be willing to try perhaps a different scent) but this one (Cedarwood Marine) is in my opinion (and other un-official smellers) very disagreeable.	2015-08-15

The box was ripped open on one of the tabs, the material of the box was thin and very different from other Dior product packaging, and the directions sheet was torn, so this was probably open and tried by someone and returned, and then sent to me.

I decided to highlight my hair at home (NEVER again and I MEAN IT this time... anyway...) and ended up doing 3 processes in one day to salvage my hair and a trip to Mexico the next day.  I did some major damage to my long hair from the 3 processes and this conditioner was recommended to me by a hair pro.  I tried the smaller size first and wow... it helps.  I bought the bigger size because it's either this conditioner, for now, or cut off my hair.  I leave on for an hour or so under a disposable shower cap once a week.	2015-08-15

I love coconut oil, and all it's health benefits, but it's a little too much to use on my face for moisturizing purposes.  So when I found an anti aging serum with retinol, ferulic acid, and coconut oil, I was intrigued and had to try it.  I use the serum once in the morning after cleansing my face and neck.  I apply it on my face, neck, and decolletage and let it dry.  Then I apply my normal moisturizer and go on with my daily routine.  I feel like my skin looks more hydrated and feels softer to the touch.  I do feel like my skin has better tone to it and some of my redness has diminished.  I am really pleased with Cleopatra Beauty Care's Antin Aging Serum.  I haven't had any issues with sensitivity with it and love that it has coconut oil in.  I would highly recommend this serum.<br />I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review. All opinions are my very own.	2015-08-15

It is not easily absorbed by the skin. Even hours later you still have a greasy layer on your skin. It's best to use it before you go to bed or you will smear it all over the carpet.

I made the mistake of purchasing a makeup brush set from amazon that had good description and reviews at a great price. Unfortunately the set was utter garbage and fell apart almost immediately.<br /><br />After doing extensive research and watching Youtube  recommends from beauty expert Lisa Eldridge, I bought this set, along with [[ASIN:B004Q1GCFG Sigma Beauty Basic Eyes Kit - 7 ct]] and https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UH0528/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1 to create a customized brush collection.<br /><br />The Touch Up Set is of excellent quality and arrived exactly as the image and description indicates. I've used every brush multiple times and find the handles to be a great size, even though they are market as &#34;travel&#34;. My favorite brush in the set is the white tipped brush - I use it for bronzer and it blends perfectly. I love EcoTools and have many other products in their line, I especially love their commitment to the a better planet.	2015-08-15

I received this product free of charge - thanks to Crest and BzzAgent -to evaluate its effectiveness. I used it twice a day as recommended. One minute for the paste and one minute for the gel each time. I even brushed a little longer and used my electric tooth brush. My teeth were a little sensitive to begin with and this actually made my gums SO sensitive that they would bleed a little each time. I powered through it and sadly, after 4 weeks it still didn't make a difference in the shade of my teeth. Unlike some pictures of the results shown in the reviews, I took the pictures in the same spot of my bathroom and didn't use a filter!!! See for yourself- top is before, bottom is after 4 weeks of use. I'm not happy with this product in the least.	2015-08-15

I used  Henna Guys on my AFrican American  natural hair. I wanted to cover my gray hair. This is my third different all-natural product try. I did the henna first and it came out a really vibrant orangish-red. Then I did the indigo. Basically,the henna covered all my gray, which was great. The indigo only darkened the henna to an dark auburn. Not even close to jet black. Truthfully, I haven't found one natural product that gives you jet black no matter how well you follow the directions or tweak it with coffee, tea. lemon juice, or whatever else. I decided that if I want to keep using natural products that I need to give up on getting shiny black hair. BTW, I did 2 applications of this so far and have not gotten it anywhere close to black.	2015-08-15

I can then comb through my hair easily, and after I dry it, my hair is noticeably soft.  I've been using my bottle for almost a year, and I still have over half left.

Putting it on, it did feel a little different than the solid that I normally use...it was more wet (for lack of a better term), but it dried very quickly and I didn't feel like I was wearing anything.<br /><br />The first day I wore this deoderant, I had a 14 hour day at work that was extremely busy. I was constantly on the move. It wasn't until I got in my car to head home that I remembered the new deoderant that I had put on that day. Of course I did what any normal person would do...I sniffed my armpit. I was amazed that the deoderant had held up all day. The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel doesn't have a strong sent, but it smells clean...I could still smell that clean scent at the end of the day. It definitely holds up!<br /><br />My second test was the day that I forgot to put deoderant on in the morning. It wasn't until I got to work that I remembered. I was about to reach for the stick that I keep in my desk, but I thought that I would see if the deoderant really held up (I had taken a shower the night before and applied deoderant afterwards) for multiple days. While I don't plan to forget deoderant regularly, it was nice to know that this would hold up for a really long time and keep me smelling fresh.	2015-08-15

Its okay the only thing i dont like it defently has fly aways in the front which made me nervous i hate trying things that are new ..its the only con for now but if it starts get my hair worst i will stop..

After that, it fades to blue (which is also pretty), then green (not so pretty, but kind of cool).<br /><br />Tips:<br />1. Pre-treat hair with the Pravana demi-permanent serum before coloring<br />2. Use smock, gloves and Vaseline along hairline to prevent staining<br />3. Wash hair 2-3 times per week max with the recommended Pravana Shampoo and Conditioner<br />4. I add some Violet color to the Conditioner (I use a plastic VOSS water bottle for the mixture)<br />5. Wash hair in cold water: I use the shower in my tub. I partially fill the tub with hot water (just past my ankles to keep my feet warm), then wash my hair in cold water. Aside from keeping me warm, the tub being partially filled prevents the color from staining the floor/sides of tub.<br />6. Rinse any stains in tub/shower IMMEDIATELY (or it sets).	2015-08-15

Which is why it leaked inside the ziplock it was placed in. But for the price( like $3,50) it was not a big deal. The product seemed good quality, so pretty sure it was IBD gel inside, bc it applied smoothly and cured well under led lamp. The color is a see-through white pearl. I did two coats and it did not look good by itself, so I ended up doing a French tip on top of it. I think it would also be good as a pearly topcoat for other colors, not by itself. Overall I am very happy with the product u can't beat the price and I like that I have an option to make a pearl effect on my nails.	2015-08-15

I was annoyed but i could deal with that<br />2) i tried to blend out a crease color with it. Didn't blend to my satisfaction though i sat there patiently for a good few minutes.<br />3) it turned out to be quite scratchy and the crease of my eye was red and stung a bit.<br />Needless to say i will NOT repurchase.<br />Only reason i gave it two stars was because i now use it for highlighting, which it does a good enough job of. Nonetheless did not perform the way i wanted it to or what it was made to do.	2015-08-15

Not only did I spend soo much only to realize their fake but I was also embarrassed walking out of the salon with my 100% &#34;real human hair&#34;<br />Don't waste your money.<br />If they happen to match your hair perfect without dying go for it also for thick hair I recommend two.	2015-08-15

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Beautiful! Perfect for any age....male or female!	When I ordered these tattoos I had my doubts that the metallic would actually look silver or gold, I figured it would look more grey and bronze kind of dull like. However, when I got them in the mail to my surprise they had all the brilliance of silver and gold medal. To me the real test was once it was applied. They are very easy to apply it has directions but you do it like any other temporary tattoo with warm water. I was super shocked when the tattoos had the same brilliant once they were applied. They are very beautiful and can definitely take the place of jewelry. I wore these temporary tattoos swimming and through several showers and they still look nice. They did not crack or separate like the temporary tattoos used to get in cracker jacks. These are very high quality and would work on a man or woman and would also work on a child teenager or adult. I am very pleased with this product and I will probably be buying more. I received these tattoos at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-15

I have dark blonde hair , and I color (medium ash blonde) and highlight it.  I left the highlight on too long (fell asleep) and had ugly yellow/brassy results.

I had to play around with just how best to use it - leaving on for 5 min. caused my hair to be dry.  I ended up mixing 50/50 with my normal shampoo, and leave on for only 3 min; then follow with conditioner.  This seems to be the winning combination.  Very, very happy with the results!	2015-08-15

Received the Braun Silk-&eacute;pil 9 for free for testing purposes (but my opinion is my own) and so far it has not disappointed! After charging for an hour I turned it on and first tried the body exfoliating brush in the shower with some body gel. This was amazing! I felt like I was giving a soothing massage and it left my skin feeling soft. Next I went to epilate my legs and my bikini areas. For reference, I usually shave my legs, but wax my bikini area. I have used an epilator previously maybe 10 years ago but it left much to be desired so I switched to other methods. This particular epilator worked fantastic! I am obsessed. My bikini area which I was myself regularly using wax strips was used to hair removal, so it didn't hurt too much if any at all, and I was able to use it both wet and dry. I think dry worked better and it was quick without any need for precision. I pretty much kept running it back and forth until all the sensations of hair being zapped out were gone and everything was baby smooth. The light comes in handy for this, especially if using a magnifying mirror or using in the shower, probably my favorite feature. My legs aren't used to being removed in this fashion so that did hurt a bit more, went back and forth three times like a razor and everything was removed rather quickly to my surprise. It did leave some red bumps so I smoothed on some soothing lotion afterwards and it calmed down by dinner time. I would imagine the more I use this the less irritating it would get as my bikini zone did not get red. I absolute love using this for miscellaneous areas I would have otherwise tweezed a well such as my stomach, toes, etc.<br />Pros:<br /> - Comes with two other attachments and for precision and a body exfoliating brush which all fits in a white waterproof drawstring bag. There is also a brush provided for cleaning as well.<br />- Leaves skin baby soft after using and for longer than shaving.<br />- Quick hair removal suitable for every day use.<br />- Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.<br />- Can be used dry or wet for in the shower.<br />- Light feature comes very much in handy.<br />- Beautiful design and white pearly color.<br />Cons:<br />- Need to do it several times or so for the skin to get used to epilation.<br />- Takes an hour to charge, cannot be used with the cord.<br />Verdict: - Worth the investment for smooth silky skin. This is a product I will be using daily from now on to replace my waxing and shaving. A must have in my beauty arsenal.br />- Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.<br />- Can be used dry or wet for in the shower.<br />- Light feature comes very much in handy.<br />- Beautiful design and white pearly color.<br />Cons:<br />- Need to do it several times or so for the skin to get used to epilation.<br />- Takes an hour to charge, cannot be used with the cord.<br />Verdict: - Worth the investment for smooth silky skin.

I've been using this Denman 7 Row Styling Brush for about 20 years. I first started using it when I would blow dry my relaxed hair, and I continued to use it after I stopped relaxing 15 years ago. I love love love it for brushing my curly curly hair!! It adds definition to my curls and is a blessing when it comes to detangling hair. This is a sturdy brush that may be too rigid for some people--especially those with fine hair.  I've tried the larger 9 row styling brush from Denman, but it's not strong enough even though it has more rows. Those 9 rows are just too flexible, so I highly recommend the 7 row brush. My 3c/4a mane needs to be tamed sometimes and allowed to go wild at other times, so this is the brush for me--forever and always!	2015-08-15

I pump about 3 pumps of this oil into my hands, then smooth it over my hair about an hour before I shampoo. I apply 2 more pumps to my wet hair, then blow dry. My hair isn't frizzy, and feels silky. I was concerned that this thicker formula would weight my hair down, but it didn't. It still had bounce and body, but looked so much healthier.

US	29336661	R4T3XF37LZPRC	B00YW6OLYE	660521084	Tame the Beast USDA Organic Beard Oil	Beauty	5	1	1	N	N	Great product. Simple ingredients that you can feel confident are sustainable and GMO / Pesticide Free.  Recommended.	This product is NOT just for manly beards, it does double duty for skin and feminine locks as well.<br /><br />What You Get: (1) Beard Oil / Conditioner, (1.7 fl. oz. / 50mL) in MIRON glass bottle with black bulb glass dropper pipette.<br /><br />Ingredients: USDA certified 100% Organic Argan Oil and 100% Organic Jojoba Oil.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />➔ I loved how this oil made my hair feel. I have long (down to my butt), natural barrel sized curls, which have a tendency to frizz out and go EWOK status (Star Wars reference). This oil left my hair soft, shiny and didn't weigh my curls down. Argan oil is also great for your cuticles - so if you work with your hands (as I do) this will help repair your skin as well. I liked that they didn't spoil the integrity of the oils by adding some kind of fragrance.<br /><br />➔ Organic Jojoba Oil (Simmondsia chinensis). Pressed from plant seeds native to the American Southwest, the beans of a shrub like plant, and it is actually a liquid plant wax. USDA-certified Organic Jojoba Oil is a natural, time-honored moisturizer for skin and hair. Suitable for even the most sensitive skin, it penetrates quickly after application, and also makes for an enriching aftershave moisturizer. Moisturizes skin without leaving any oily residue • Effectively cleanses clogged pores • Helps prevent flakiness when massaged on scalp. Because Jojoba is not an oil but rather a wax, its shelf life and stability is considerably higher than most oils and rancidity is very rarely a concern.<br /><br />Note:  Jojoba oil may become cloudy and solidify as the temperature drops. This is a normal process that occurs from the hardening of the fats and waxes, and it will become stable at or around room temperature.<br /><br />➔ Organic Argan Oil (Argania spinosa). In 1998, the Argan forest in Morocco was designated a UNESCO protected biosphere so argan oil is sustainable. Incredibly rich in Vitamin E, Essential Fatty Acids, and Proteins, Argan Oil helps fight lines, repair imperfections, minimize scars; all while restoring texture, elasticity and tone in skin. Rub your hands together and run your fingers through your hair / beard to create shine and tame frizz. You only need a small amount. It lasts a long time. Lightweight and easily absorbed!<br /><br />➔ 100% USDA Certified by A Bee Organic.  Pesticide free. As with all organic products, none of it is grown or handled using genetically modified organisms, which the organic standards expressly prohibit. Products bearing this label are made with 100% organic ingredients and may display the USDA Organic seal. I feel confident using this product, having gone through such stringent standards. It is great that this company cares about their product enough to forego the expense of USDA certification.<br /><br />➔ Bottle. The packaging distinguishes itself by its high quality graphics (loved the Sasquatch!), with USDA seal and MIRON glass (MIRON Violet glass BV from The Netherlands) increases the shelf life of products and prolongs their potency --- offers products optimal protection against the harmful effects of light.

Beauty	5	18	21	N	Y	A solution to black hair woes	I am an African American male and I purchased a couple bottles of these during a very slick coupon deal on Amazon almost 6 months ago. Having naturally dry, frizzy hair is something that most if not all black people have to live with. Black men usually just opt to chop off the naps and keep it low. I was in that same bubble until I actually tried this leave-in conditioner. I've since purchased enough for a 2 year supply and am continuing to let my hair grow out. This product really has been a solution to a problem that I did not realize I had until I tried it.	2015-08-15

I was prepared to try the more expensive ones but I went ahead and got this Aveeno product first.  It actually worked exactly how I hoped – moisturizes my skin and gives me the SPF protection and I don't get stinging eyes anymore! It is light and not greasy and dries quickly on my face.

I will say it pulls a bit behind the ears - it would not be comfortable, for me, to wear it for more than about 45 minutes, and even then I'm usually a bit sore.  It also is not a perfect fit for my face - a little small around the jawline (more for a heart-shaped face).  But it definitely does the trick, and I have bought a couple as gifts for friends who are learning the wonders of sheet masks. :)	2015-08-15

It came, unwrapped, it seemed like it was used or sold after it was purchased and nor what the buyer wanted or expected. The deodorant stick did not have the seal over the roll on. Just overall disappointed, because it seemed like I refuted this, or picked up at a flea market. If my mom didn't need it like the day it came I define tl would have returned it for a refund, especially  since I spent extra money for rush shipping.  Really emberassed t ok give my mom  something like that.	2015-08-15

It's much sturdier than it looks online. The base has a nice heft to it so you don't have to be concerned about it being top heavy.  One disclaimer -Discovered that my shaving brush that came in the &#34;art of shaving&#34; starter kit is too small to hang (Oh darn so now I have go and look for a new brush! I found one that was reviewed by another Amazon customer who said the brush fit perfectly in this razor/brush holder). I'll come back and let you know if my first assessment was correct.  The brush is supposed to arrive in 2 days.  Thanks sweetheart for this wonderful gift!	2015-08-15

The scent is light, crisp and refreshing. I have never before had a candle that can be used as a massage oil, so this was new for me. The oil, when applied to skin, has a much stronger scent than just being burned. The texture is soft, but still just a tad waxy feeling.<br /><br />One issue I noted, the wick drops off into the candle in little black chunks, which will make it harder to use the melted oil in a clean manner. Maybe I left mine burning too long, perhaps using it less than 30 minutes at any given time this may not happen, but I burned it straight out of the box for a little while and there are already several charred pieces of wick in my candle. If you are using this just for scent and ambiance, it's no big deal. If you are using it consistently as a massage oil, it's definitely a negative.  Overall, though, I really like the candle and the idea of fresh massage oil.<br /><br />I received this candle at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review, which I believe I have provided here. I am a frequent and long-standing Amazon shopper who would never recommend an item that I don't happily use myself.	2015-08-15

I liked having the ability to clean the heads and screens with tap water. The shave was fine for an electric razor, but not as good as a blade. I had to recharge it every 2-3 days. I deducted two stars because after two years the power cord would not make contact with the internal connections, thus I was unable to recharge the batteries. I'm not sure if something inside broke or the water corroded some internal part. The shaver will not work with the power cord installed either. Thus it became useless.	2015-08-15

These clever little patches would have changed my life if they had been available years ago when my face was plagued by intermittent stress-related breakouts.  Nowadays my skin rarely breaks out but, when it does, I now have the answer.  These small, round patches are nearly invisible once on my face and work like a charm.<br /><br />Using them is simple: wash the affected area, pat dry with a clean towel and apply the Dream Dot, pressing well for a few seconds.  Ideally, the patch should stay in place for eight hours (overnight works well) and I found that they are not affected by water if you decide to leave them on longer.  What I really like is that they do not contain any harsh ingredients, unlike the usual acne gels that dry up and irritate my skin.<br /><br />I find these really useful for those summertime heat spots that don't seem to resolve.  The Dream Dots keep the area clean and literally draw out the inflammation, and next morning my skin is well on its way to repair the problem.  Sometimes it takes a second application to complete the repair, but it's a brilliant alternative to having an ugly spot that doesn't go away.<br /><br />There are 24 patches in each packet, plenty for occasional use.  There is a trick to peeling them off the backing and, after a few tries, it becomes quite easy.  Really a touch of genius.<br />Test sample gratefully received to enable me to write this review.	2015-08-15

I purchased the shade Medium from my local Rite Aid for $5.57 and that accounts for my 10% customer loyalty discount. I did make it a point to ask the cashier during this transaction what the return policy was on make up to which she replied, &#34;Just have your receipt and returns are not a problem.&#34;  Maybe I jinxed myself by asking?<br />My problems with this product are: the shade Medium is too light in my opinion to be classified as Medium. Secondly the formula lacks blendability. This result was the concealer appeared ashy and patchy on the skin. Perhaps this is an old tube of makeup because it did not blend whatsoever. I attempted to blend this out by the simple method of fingertips and then again with my SEPHORA Pro Airbrush Concealer brush neither were successful. Drugstore concealer or not this formula simply is not good.	2015-08-15

I already have the D3190A, which is a LOT like this AC215C that I selected for my daughter because she likes this color better than the purple.<br />They both have the &#34;cool shot feature&#34; which we love, and the cleanable filter (*VERY important feature to keep airflow going strong) which is key to its ability to dry hair quickly, you would think all hair dryers would have it!<br /><br />Now to its features: it has the three heat settings & two power settings (*I wish it had 3 power settings!)<br />It has a concentrator and a diffuser which my daughter who has a head full of natural curls says it is an ESSENTIAL attachment to have if you have curls like her.<br />It also has the &#34;ionic (heat protection) technology&#34; that keeps your hair free from frizz & fly aways, it dries hair fast we both have long hair & it doesn't tangle it all up when blow drying on high,<br /><br />* ALL of this is just like the purple D3190A model, where it differs is that this one has a<br />FOUR year warranty as opposed to the D3190A, which only has a 2 yr warranty and they say it has a Salon quality AC motor for 4 times a longer life<br />so, that explains the longer warranty. For $10.00 more you get a better value as this is supposed to last twice as long as the purple D3190A one that is $20.00<br />They both function excellently, if money is tight get the purple D3190A one, if you have the extra $10 I would go with this one!	2015-08-15

Beauty	5	0	1	N	Y	This soap plus Aloe Vesta Antifungal Ointment cured my jock itch when other products didn't.	i had recurring jock itch for the past two years.  never had jock itch or athletes foot before in my life, but I couldn't get rid of it.  I used all the over the counter chemical products such as Lamisil and they would help clear it up over a period of time but it kept coming back.  I decided to take a different course of action and got this Tea Tree soap and also  Aloe Vesta Antifungal Ointment.  I would wash my groin area twice a day with this product and then completely dry the are (I used a hair dryer much to the chagrin of my GF) and then apply the Aloe Vesta ointment.  Overall the products seemed much more natural than the brand name chemical creams but best of all IT WORKED. After about three weeks I was completely clear.  When its hot and muggy I just use the soap and I have not had another breakout since.	2015-08-15

One major difference I’ve noticed is the complete lack of hair in the shower drain. It appears as though I’m not losing hair in the same amount I was prior to using the Lipogain products. My hair is also noticeably thicker to the touch and look. I had used generic Rogaine for years and it seemed to reduce hair loss but after switching to Lipogain the difference is far more noticeable. It seems to have effect on the entire scalp.	2015-08-15

Forget the scrubby which is just a bunch of nylon. You know, the kind which comes apart after a while, This one stays together and get the job done.<br /><br />Dove Men Care, though, is for men: The Dove Men Care is a little rougher than the ones you pick up for dollar and it takes a while to get used to it. However, once you are used to it, it seems natural. Another advantage is the two sides. One is the typical scrubby (albeit a little rougher). The other side is more defoliating or scraping  (e.g., getting grease on your leg from bicycling. I could never get this off easily before.).<br /><br />Four stars because it a little rough.

Well, I guess I'll try it; it's the weekend and I don't have a date tonight.  I washed and conditioned my hair which, as my uncle puts it, still makes me look like a stringy-haired blonde.  I put on the gel thinking it would be sticky and was pleasantly surprised to see it went right into my dry hair and left no residue!  I set my hair with hot rollers, and VOILA! I had curls that were full, bouncy and fun.  The reason I was hesitant to experiment during a work day was because every other gel I have tried left my hair with a plastic coating.

I didn't buy this online but I found myself on this page because of what it was doing to my mouth. I've been using this toothpaste for about a week and I've noticed that food has been tasting much blander and that my tongue feels dry, scratchy, and all around uncomfortable. I was worried it could be a medical condition but reading these other reviews I think I have a mild chemical burn on my tongue from this toothpaste. It would make sense, since these symptoms have only popped up and gotten worse since I switched to this toothpaste. I'm throwing it away and getting a different brand, hopefully that'll put my tongue and taste buds back to normal.	2015-08-15

First lather on shave soap showed some brown oily residue, I figured since the brush was brand new I would have to break it in, but yet here I am months later and still brown residue coming off bristles. The bristles themselves are very coarse to the skin, especially for those who have sensitive skin and are likely to bleed during a shave. What did it in for me was that after about 6 uses, with typical lather technique, the middle part of the brush (essentially the core of the brush where most lather should be) became depressed into the brush, the bristles became tangled down there and that results in a garbage lather. Lastly, I feel the handle is too small as most of the lather created always drips down. Still using, but only until my Edwin Jagger Best badger brush arrives. You get what you pay for. Since badger brushes are graded by hair, it's like the three little pigs story. Don't start with the hay house (this brush) spend your 16$ and go to the next level.	2015-08-15

I am so excited for this review because this mask is AMAZING!! I have worked in the skincare field for 9 years as a licensed esthetician and laser technician so I have used hundreds of facial mask and skin brightening products. This mask defiantly surprised me I didn’t think I would like it this much, but I am in love!<br /><br />Applying the mask is easy you just look really silly or “scary” as my daughter says lol, but all you have to do is open it peel off the front and back paper and place mask on the skin (I would recommend doing this in the mirror). Once you place it on the skin it feels nice and moistening and I love that it stays that way the whole time it is on. I hate when mask harden and crack because it makes your skin feel itchy, but this mask stays nice and moist the whole time. I kept it on for 30 min. and honestly I probably would of keep in on longer if I didn’t have to go to the store. After removing the mask my skin felt so refreshed, it was so smooth, hydrated, and had a nice glow!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this mask, it has exceeded all my expectations and the best part is Nerd Skincare products are made of organically farmed, cruelty-free, fair-trade, and natural ingredients, which is always a plus!  I know I will be purchasing more ASAP and maybe adding this mask to one of our facial treatments at work.<br /><br />I am sharing some photos so you can see how it looks (please don’t judge my photo taking skills lol)<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own	2015-08-15

It's certainly quite thick, but it lives up to its 'fast absorbing' description.<br /><br />It rubs in very quickly with absolutely no greasy feeling. It's virtually scent - free, so can be used by cooks in the kitchen without the worry of tainting food.<br /><br />Although I don't have chapped hands, I had a couple of nicks to the skin when first testing this; it was soothing to apply with no stinging.<br />For those who like their products to have natural ingredients, this cream has three, namely shea butter, olive oil and apricot kernel oil.<br /><br />The claim is that the skin hydrating properties remain even after hands are washed. I use moisturising handwash so this was a difficult claim to judge - it takes so little time to rub in that I found myself automatically applying an extra dab of cream anyway. Although it absorbs quickly, a little does go a long way with this cream.<br /><br />The price of this cream compares very favourably with other high performance hand creams, the  Garnier name being an established name of quality.<br />Summary: a pleasant, economical cream for dry skin that soothes, protects and hydrates well. I received this product to review without cost via the Amazon UK Vine Voices scheme but this is my honest and unbiased opinion.	2015-08-15

If you'd like to lessen the shine, I suggest you flip the wig and soak it in water and add a cup of fabric softener. Leave it for around five days and allow it to dry in the shade. If you don't have time, a temporary solution is to slap some baby powder on your wig and pat it out.<br />As I said, the wig looks like as it is in the photo except for the longer bangs meant for you to style. I'd honestly give this a five star if it weren't for the shedding. Though it's possible to put the strands back on the wig, I still would like to be free from that hassle.	2015-08-15

It worked as a regular shampoo, but I can get a regular organic shampoo at my local Sprouts for half the price. However I am giving it a two because my hair did look shiny while using this. Sometimes organic can dry my hair out and this did not do that.  So, I would say if you were looking for a regular shampoo, this would probably fit the bill.  If you are looking for hair loss prevention- I might suggest you try a different avenue.	2015-08-15

I continue to use the handle and buy refill cartridges, which are also available on Amazon (but you can use any Venus refills; they don't have to be Venus Embrace).<br /><br />Once you start using 5 blades, it's so hard to go back. The moisture ribbon that surrounds the blades isn't a substitute for shaving cream, but it definitely helps give a closer shave. The handle has a comfortable no-slip grip and the head of the razor easily contours to your curves giving you a close shave even in tricky parts like knees and armpits.<br /><br />With these, my legs feel like dolphins and my arm pits have no bumps or ingrown hairs.

The two pack is only a couple bucks more than just buying one so this way you have a spare. Much nicer than the slightly cheaper pair I lent out were never returned.

One review compares them to the Leatherman Raptor scissors which really shows how great these are that they compare at all with the $60 Raptors. For sixty bucks you can get five sets of two so ten scissors. Great deal for the price and work well.	2015-08-15

The rollers fit my device perfectly. The extra course roller handled even my toughest calluses on the bottom of my feet. When my husband saw how great my feet looked, he had to try it out on his hands. He works as a mechanic, and his hands are very rough. After just a few minutes, his hands were as smooth as they used to be. I love that these rollers can handle the roughest, toughest calluses, but there is never any pain!

When I joined the campaign, I was not going to get my hopes up that I would be recieving a great or even good product.  I have to say I was certainly wrong.  This deodorant holds up wonderful.  It does what it says; it lasts.  I am usually a heavy sweater, and this worked well for me.  No, it isnt a clinical strength, but I wasnt drenched.  The scent lasts, and isnt too overpowering.  Just a nice light scent.  I really enjoy this one, and I plan on using it in the future.	2015-08-15

I made the mistake of purchasing a makeup brush set from amazon that had good description and reviews at a great price. Unfortunately the set was utter garbage and fell apart almost immediately.<br /><br />After doing extensive research and watching Youtube  recommends from beauty expert Lisa Eldridge, I bought this Sigma set, along with [[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Kabuki - F80]] and [[ASIN:B005WLVC5O EcoTools Touch Up Set]].<br /><br />These brushes are excellent quality and arrived exactly as the image and description indicates. I have used every brush many times and find the handles to be the perfect length and the bristles to be soft yet incredibly precise. The combined sets I purchased perfectly round out my brush collection and I couldn't be more pleased! Five Stars!	2015-08-15

Beauty	4	1	1	N	N	Cella Primo Sapone	Like others, word of mouth drew me to this product.  I used TOBS Sandalwood as my 'expensive' cream.  Excellent results with little effort, but that $15 seemed to evaporate in a month or so.  Proraso and Razorock stuff works well, keep the Col. Conk for starter kits.  Tried small tub of Cella, not the greatest results but I got better (any problem with lather can be solved with MORE PRODUCT) as time went on.<br />This is now my daily lather maker, and although I still don't always hit the perfect lather, it is my adding water too soon and often, or whipping the lather so much I am putting air in and drying the whole mess out.  I pair this soap with Fatip open comb safety razors (viva italia), although I have a Parker shavette on the way (buy band-aid stock, it will go up).	2015-08-15

It's amazingly difficult to find a light, non-oily leave in conditioner that doesn't contain harmful chemicals, especially synthetic fragrance.  Since I've become pregnant, I've had to stop using ALL of my old haircare products, either because they contained phthalates or because they were too heavy for my now terribly oily scalp.  I have very long, thick hi-lighted hair that needs extra TLC a few inches from the scalp, but my oily scalp has been a MAJOR issue - it's like I'm a teenager again.  I started getting scalp acne, including painful cystic acne along the nape of my neck.  I had to stop using my extra-moisturizing conditioner, but that left me with knotted, dry ends.  This TotLogic leave in conditioner helped me find just the right balance and doesn't make my hair sticky or greasy, and it doesn't exacerbate my prenatal acne.  At first I wasn't sure about this product because it's almost like water, and I find it to be an okay but not great detangler; it does take a good bit of product to get the tangles out of thick adult hair, but while I'm dealing with this oily scalp problem and desire to keep all harmful stuff away while pregnant, I find it worth the extra time it takes to do the job.  I think this would be a perfect conditioning/detangling spray for a child, although I haven't used it for this purpose yet, and I plan on using this on my daughter when she needs it.  Unlike some reviewers, I don't find the smell off-putting at all - it's pleasant enough, very light and unnoticeable once hair is dry (and yes, my sense of smell is CRAZY right now).  I do still miss my Davines Nounou leave-in conditioner because it made my hair so silky and shiny, but if you need a very lightweight detangler without all the icky stuff found in typical products, whether it be for a child or because you're pregnant, you might give TotLogic a try.  I'm glad I did!	2015-08-15

I use the &#34;Smooth Cure&#34; treatment on my towel-dried hair, and then allow it to air dry.  My hair is slightly curly, but has a lot of frizz at the crown, and this product works for days between shampoos, though of course you can use more before styling if desired.  &#34;Smooth Cure&#34; is a medium consistency lotion that dispenses easily from the pump, but doesn't drip from your hands before or while you're applying it to your hair.  My hair is of medium-to-thick texture, and just above shoulder length, and I find that I need 7-8 pumps of product instead of the 3-5 instructed on the bottle's directions.

This sea sponge sampler came with 3, relatively large sized (bigger than my palms) sponges. They have a distinct smell to it - like seaweed. I wasn't too impressed with the softest one, since it fell apart after three washes (even after the company sent me a new one after I contacted them about the problem). The other two are pretty good, I like how soft they are, and how the soap lathers easily. I am not convinced that any of them is able to exfoliate though. Overall, a good way to try out the sea sponges and figure out which one you like the most.	2015-08-15

I try to eat organic and anything I use also has to be organic. A paraben free and sulfate free with natural essential oils beats the best brands out there. So naturally this was very appealing to me. So far, I have loved using this product everyday. The peace of not using any chemical is wonderful. Also, I have recently recovered from ovarian cysts and I try to stay away from anything that is chemical. Unfortunately the whole gamut of products out there are just chemicals. Maybe the number of bubbles will be leass than the chemical based products but knowing that is is not harming your body in the name of cleaning is worth a lot more. I was able to get this for discounted rate and I intend on getting more.	2015-08-15

Not like your usual liquidity smooth lotion texture.	I was really excited to receive this product because I am a huge fan of bee products but I was quickly disappointed that it wasn't an liquidity moisturizer but more of a hard chapstick texture instead. I love that this product contains natural ingredients but it's inconvenient to use. In order for me to moisturizer my body, I would have to melt the cream into a liquid because it would take me forever to get warm up the hard cream in hands. I used it on a dry patchy spot on my face and it was okay. I felt like it didn't real moisturize and absorb into my skin very well though. This is definitely great for hand lotion or chapstick though. Very pricey for such a small tiny jar of this product. I wouldn't repurchase again unless it did something magical to my skin. So far, I haven't seen any changes. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-15

I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  Very cool Eye Makeup Remover Wipes by Specific Beauty. With the two sided eye makeup remover and exfoliating wipes, these make the perfect product to clean your face. Each pack has 30 wipes, but they were way thicker than I thought they would be, which is great! This way I know that they won't rip off when I'm using them. Very easy to pull the out of the package and they don't stick to each other.  I prefer using them as a make up removers more than just for exfoliation, they are moist enough for me. I don't need more than 2 for my regular daily make up - they clean very well and easy. The scent they have is like aloe and citrus - it's very fresh and it leaves very light feeling on your skin. I'm definitely happy with this purchase.  A 5 star product!	2015-08-15

Beauty	4	1	2	N	Y	This is very nice and has no fragrance	This is very nice and has no fragrance. There are times when your skin just begs for moisture, and this has delivered without irritating my skin. My skin was oily prior to menopause but it has been slowly drying.  Lately, I have taken to putting on Vitamin E capsules and then adding this cream or a hyalauronic serum (I alternate stuff) to smear everything around so I am experimenting further. But by itself, this cream has felt good to me and that, I think, has made me feel better about how I look.  It is hard to say what I have been doing lately including this product that has done the most or everything for my skin.  But while alternating treatments, this is a very nice treatment to add into the mix and have handy. Without the added Vitamin E, it sinks into skin quickly and leaves a nice result.	2015-08-15

You couldn't use it while plugged in	I tried a few trimmers I got from walmart, but they were pretty crappy. You couldn't use it while plugged in, and had to wait for the battery to charge for 10hrs and it would last for like 30mins. Even the other Philips models they had there too.<br /><br />This one is much a better quality. Vacuum is a great bonus. It sucks up most of the hairs, I still get some that fall obviously, but not nearly as much. Makes cleaning the sink much quicker and easier for me.<br />I can plug it in, and use it when the battery is low, and not worry if it is going to die on me mid trim.  Still takes a while to fully charge, but it's much better than other models I've tried. And the battery life lasts a lot longer than the other models I got from walmart.<br />Adjustments are nice and just what I was looking for as well.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this.

I have bought these a few times before, they are a little thin so you need to buy one more then one package if you have thick hair. I order 3 at a time. 21 pieces is a lot but it pays off when you are trying to blend with thick hair.  All though they aren't not real hair I have found a way to curl and straighten them  To curl them make sure they are WET not damp and use a medium heat and hold till the hair is too hot to touch. Takes a while but its worth it for the price and quialty of the hair.  Highly recommend.	2015-08-15

These are great facial wipes -- but can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn't enough time to shower. The Yes to Cucumber face wipes are a quick and easy way to clean your face and have a refreshing cucumber scent. These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can. These wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. They are made in Israel. These wipes are highly recommended!! In fact, I like them well enough to repurchase regularly with subscribe & save.<br /><br />The Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent and are also worth considering. I prefer the scents of the Yes to Cucumber/Coconut wipes much more than that of the Yes to Grapefruit wipes. If you're looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.	2015-08-15

It does tingle a little bit after application. It was mild though, did not last very long and was not irritating to my skin. It does not dry nicely on my face - it feels tacky afterwards. Trying to apply makeup over this (even an hour later) does not bode well. Also, I have not noticed any changes in my skin tone/texture etc. in comparison to other similar products.<br /><br />I have used this serum and the OZ Naturals vitamin c serum.	2015-08-15

Let me begin by saying that last Halloween, I went to Ricky’s looking for a wig to go with my Day of the Dead costume for the annual NYC Greenwich Village Halloween Parade and I could not find a single one I liked. If only I’d had this one 10 months ago! I’ll be planning Halloween 2015 around this wig – I don’t know what yet, but it’ll be something good.<br /><br />Anyway, the wig comes packaged well and neatly so that there isn’t any tangling or frizzing when you remove the safety hair net. It also comes with a special metal pinned comb and a wig cap. It’s made of something called Japanese Kanekalon fiber and I haven’t the slightest idea what that is. But it seems like a synthetic material that’s both soft and shiny. It’s really long, which is great for staying warm on the long cold (though fun) parade route.<br /><br />I have an average sized head, I think, and this was a little on the loose side but not too bad. It didn’t move around that much when it was on. They also sell a cobalt blue version that is to die for. I chuckled a bit when I read in the description that this is “natural” looking. It’s not really natural looking but that’s what makes it so fantastic in the first place. Also, I don't know how this can be only $12.99 - this is a lot of wig for the price.<br /><br />As for cleaning, I haven’t washed it – no need to yet, but the instructions say to use mild shampoo and cold water so it seems simple enough and I have a mannequin head that I can dry it on when the time comes.<br /><br />So now, I’m really, really looking forward to Halloween, which is right around the corner!<br /><br />I wanted to post images but the review form is not giving me the option to add photos or video. I will try to add pictures to this later if I am able to.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion.	2015-08-15

HORRIBLE. I am an expert flat ironer and even on the highest heat, my hair was still frizzy in the end. The sample argan oil helped with smoothing hair but no matter what, my hair was very puffy after the stroke. I gave away my ConAir for this one and will definitely be switching back.

It's not disgusting but I'm not able to use it on my face, especially being preggo. I would have to describe it as a musky smell. There's no cloudiness or discoloration in the bottle so I have no doubts that it's fresh and pure. I think it's just the natural scent of the oil. Next time I will purchase their scented oil. I do love the way it feels on my skin though. It's not oily or greasy and it soaks right into the skin leaving it feeling smooth and silky. I've been using it on my belly and hips to avoid stretch marks.<br /><br />I will add that the smell goes away pretty quickly which is a huge plus.	2015-08-15

So I held the pen at the end and shook it to see if there was more mascara in the pencil... But actually the black liquid did come out. So it was still in there...but the &#34;pen&#34; didn't do as good as the first time.<br />I was upset because i really wanted it to work.	2015-08-15

I sprayed a tiny bit of this into my hair, and it looked wavy for about an hour. When it dried completely (naturally dried, not blow dried), it was like straw—dry, but with sticky residue. Horrible stuff. Really downgraded the condition of my hair. I never used the original formula, but I doubt it could have been this bad and had such a cult following. this is going in the trash.	2015-08-15

Was quite excited about this hair brush. A few weeks later and now most assuredly a few months later, doubts began to creep in (and have come to permanently settle). 1. Hairbrush is hard to clean, seems perpetually dusty even after cleaning, wet dust is perpetually unappealing and where does it come from if I just washed it?, making me loath to put it near my hair. 2. Wood around brush part is chipping off. Not sure why, suspect it may be due to perpetual washing NOT so much from being dipped in water BUT from being handled near water. By chipping off I mean it started off small but now seemingly larger and larger slivers are coming off and is apparent when looking at brush. 3. By this time I have purchased another brush of a different brand and have left this to relinquish inside my closet where I come across it and loathe it.	2015-08-15

The brushes themselves do their jobs right and perfectly, but once you get them they're a bit stiff. But I washed them before I used them and they softened up easily and the strong plastic scent was gone. The only bad part would have to be how some of the brushes are double sided so when you're storing them in a bowl or a cup, one brush will have to touch the bottom. Other than that, I'm happy with this purchase and all of the brushes are versatile and there has been no hair fallout either. I would buy again and recommend to a friend. A heads up though, there is no traditional blender brush in this set!	2015-08-15

It's medium coverage, but it will accentuate every little nook, cranny, dryness, etc. The texture is jelly-like and you have to apply + blend reeeaaaallly fast or else you'll have streaks or splotches. I live in a desert, so maybe that makes a difference, idk.<br /><br /> Also, I have tried to mix it with different foundations and moisturizers, but it always turns out clumpy and never mixes well :/  When using it over moisturizer, I have to wait a good 10 minutes for it to dry/absorb or else the bb doesn't blend at all and just sits on top of my skin on globs. Gross.<br /><br />It smells pleasant and feels nice (cool and a little tingly) and light... But I'm low maintenance and this takes too much effort.	2015-08-15

I have suffered from adult acne for years and after some aggressive treatments of accutane and antibiotics, my acne is nearly gone. I still have the occasional break out and that's where this stuff comes in handy. It dried out my breakouts and healed them faster while also helping with the redness. I also have seborrhic dermatitis and it has definitely helped with that too. My skin is not nearly as red and itchy anymore. I can't say I enjoy the scent but if you have common sense you realize that sulfur has a distinct smell. I can get over that since my skin has been much less oily, itchy, and red and it's much smoother. I'll continue to use this product.	2015-08-15

As for a lip stain, I would give them a 5 because that color isn't going anywhere. Even with makeup remover. It will last all day and possibly into the next and on any other skin they touch. I would suggest caution.	2015-08-15

I just lift my hair up from underneath and give it a light spray, the same on other side, and for bangs, after using a straight iron, I give them a slight messy look or &#34;windblown&#34; look and again a light spray, then quickly piece them apart how I like. The smell is kind of nice too.<br />My only complaint is that they are a bit outrageous with their pricing. $30 for a hairspray? I'd like to say I will be a loyal customer, but I'll have to start researching comparable products out there... like Redken which aren't cheap, but even they have promotions. I get 2 /33.8 fl.oz of shampoo and conditioner for for $35 and this spray is a measly 4 oz.<br />Bumble and Bumble...you need to reassess if you want to retain your customer base.<br /><br />The moral of the story...track your shipping, so you can see how your item is being shipped.	2015-08-15

This product is like nothing I have ever experienced before. When I used the booties, I first soaked my feet in warm water for a few minutes. I put the booties on, secured them with the included tape, and covered the whole mess with socks as recommended in the instructions. An hour later I removed everything and rinsed off. I was disappointed that my feet, although a bit pruny, felt exactly the same.<br /><br />BUT WAIT!  A few days later I pulled off my socks at the end of the day and my feet were shedding like a happy lizard!  Over the next couple of days, the entirety of both feet lost their top layer of skin and uncovered a new, soft as a baby's foot layer underneath.<br /><br />This stuff is half the price of a nice pedicure but five times as effective at softening your feet. I cannot recommend enough!	2015-08-15

I found a late-20's Gillette old style open comb in an antique store, and it became my absolute favorite razor to shave my head.  Okay on the face too, but I prefer a mid-50's red tip for that.  Anyhow, using a 90 year old razor when I can get a near exact replica didn't seem like the best idea.  I'd like to keep my antique razor nice.  This Merkur Razor proved perfect.  I use it almost exclusively for my head, and I am very pleased.	2015-08-15

I ordered this product though Beuty Superstore online. I loved that I could use Amazon prime along with fulfillment though Amazon, and Beauty Superstore's great price offer. Ok so now about the product:<br /><br />I’m a 43-year-old woman. Due to allergies etc I stay away from food such as onions and other products that contain sulphur, which from what I read and hear is an integral element in hair growth. Because of that my hair generally is weak, thin, and falls out quite easily. Generally I use natural shampoo that contains something called “awla” which has generally strengthened my hair in comparison to what it is naturally. I wanted to order something different that would also give a little volume to my hair. My friend already uses this product and loves it. So after reading reviews I bought this product. This product has, over the last few days of use (approx. 5) at least, definitely improved the strength of my hair. I do realize its too early for a dramatic change, but I do feel that my hair is shedding a LOT less. When I comb it in the morning, I notice less hair coming out in the brush or even on the floor. Now I cannot say whether this product exclusively is the cause behind my hair not falling off or not because there are just too many factors involved in hair not shedding off. Also this product hasn't caused me itching or little blisters on my scalp which most other chemical products would typically cause. . However what I will definitely say is that this has to a large extent helped me. I will definitely update this review after around a month or two and hopefully the positive trend will continue.	2015-08-15

I purchased this product for my 21 old daughter who has very light skin and burns easily; she has to wear sunscreen if she's out in the sun at all.<br /><br />While the store shelves are full of sun-screen products that work well, I would never buy them.  They are full of chemicals that have been directly linked to cancer.<br />Seems illogical to apply sunscreen to prevent skin cancer when the chemicals in the sunscreen have been directly linked to cancer!  No thank you.<br /><br />It took me a long time to find a product that is natural, free of harsh chemicals and most importantly - that works.<br />I've bought other &#34;natural&#34; sunscreen products but my daughter burned as much with them on as she did with no sunscreen at all.<br /><br />This one made by Beauty by Earth is the best I've found.  It is natural and it works well.  After a full day on the beach with the outdoor temp being 95 and the sun index factor a 10 (on a scale of 0-10), including trips in and out of the salty ocean, my daughter had NO sunburn (except the base of her neck where she missed a spot and didn't apply it.......)<br /><br />It's a bit pricy, but id much rather pay for this, than pay for junk that leads to cancer or to pay an oncologist to treat cancer....<br /><br />Glad I found it; this will be our only sunscreen for as long as it is available.	2015-08-15

Night and day difference in both legs from previous condition!!!!! Skin is no longer dry!!!!! Either product is Fabulous. Conducted 24 hr experiment. Placed a 1/2 tsp of each product on nonporous surface to see if skin really absorbed product or if it simply evaporated. After 24 hours each 1/2 tsp of product  still in original form (not dried out at all) therefore my skin has been absorbing all of it. Skin absorbs either product in a few min. I put &#34;super heavy&#34; coat on twice  a day (when skin is wet) so it takes almost 45 min in my case. But in normal use just a few min. No significant difference between products  (only slight difference in fragrance). Will be buying this for the rest of my life. (in the gallon size from Amazon)	2015-08-15

Fast pain relief for muscle / tendon injury.	I have to say, I am frankly amazed at how well it works to relieve my muscle/tendon pain, and how quickly.  I have been having pain in my forearm, and have started wearing a brace part time, which helps some, but not enough.  I have been taking OTC pain relievers, but since the pain is continuing, I decided to look for other possible remedies besides numerous doses of pain pills every day.  This arnica oil actually works, and reduces the pain in my forearm within minutes.  The relief usually lasts for  a couple hours.  I am super impressed, even astounded, and wish I had tried an arnica product years ago.<br /><br />I apply about 5-10 drops of the oil to my arm, and rub it in well.  The relief is quick to follow.  I am a first time arnica user, so I can't compare this particular product to any similar product.  I chose this one because it seemed from reading descriptions and reviews that it was a stronger concentration.<br /><br />The one thing I do NOT like about this product is the cap on the bottle.  The press-flip cap sucks, if you plan to transport this anywhere or put it anywhere except sitting upright and untouched in your medicine cabinet.  I want to carry it in my purse so I can use it whenever needed.  Thankfully, I put it inside a plastic baggie and then into my purse, standing upright, but a little oil still leaked out into the baggie, despite the cap being tight and the flip top not being depressed.  Also, the aperture (opening) on the cap is too big for something you are meant to dispense a few drops of at a time, as the product comes out far too fast, and invariably a few drops leak and run down the side of the bottle. Use care when dispensing.  I think I will try and find a dropper top to replace the original cap. I would give the crummy cap 0 stars out of 5, however, I decided to review this product based on the medication quality only, and just mention the inadequate packaging in my review.	2015-08-15

The other flavors of this soap that I have tried did not have that issue.  Photo can help you see what I mean by bits.	2015-08-15

I had no idea what I was missing.	This thing literally saved my teeth. I was having constant bleeding, swollen gums, plaque buildup, you name it. I refuse to go to the dentist, for no reason other than I'm stubborn and I hate it. Within about 5 days, my gums stopped bleeding, my plaque had melted away, and my gum's swelling has been reduced significantly.<br /><br />My teeth have never felt so clean.<br /><br />I follow this with an Orabrush, then floss-picks, and finally mouth wash.<br /><br />My mouth is healed!	2015-08-15

My roommate and I both have slightly different Venus razors and these razor cartridges fit both of them perfectly. We keep trying different types, but if there's one thing I've learned it's to not even bother with refills that don't have 5 blades.  With these, my legs feel like dolphins and my arm pits have no bumps or ingrown hairs. (bro tip: if you get bumps or ingrown hairs often, quickly exfoliate your underarms with a face scrub or a loofa before you shave. It makes a HUGE difference, especially after doing it for a few weeks!)  Once you start using 5 blades it's so hard to go back. Seriously, upgrade and you'll thank yourself and each one of these 5 blades.	2015-08-15

I was so embarrassed and kept polish on to cover the ugliness.  I bought Jason's because it wasn't expensive and haven't worn polish all summer.  It smells nice and is great for a nail massage, and it does lessen the appearance of ugly nails because the nails are moisturized.  My nails are improving, but I thinks it's mostly because they are simply growing out.  I can't attest this product is the sole reason.  I'm also using it on my fingernails because I have ridges, but it's not doing anything.	2015-08-15

Glamglow itself is an amazing product, but this one was very obviously tampered with. When I got it the lid was open and some of the mask was leaked onto the side of the tub. It was also watered down. I ended up just buying this from Sephora, and was very happy with my results. Just like any other skin treatment, it's not going to work a miracle overnight. I have had acne since I was 9, and this little mask pulls out all the gunk in your skin. It doesn't dry my skin out, and glamglow also has a foaming cleanser that you can use daily. I use that and the mask once a week and my acne reduces tremendously and so does the redness of my skin. It took about two weeks of use (one use a week) for me to notice a significant difference.The only downside is that the mask is 70 bucks at sephora. But I would rather pay the money than have acne..besides since I only use it once a week, it lasts about 3 months.	2015-08-15

I've used vitamin C in the past and liked that, but wanted something more to address more issues with less product. So far this seems great. Good texture out of the bottle and on the face. I put moisturizer on right after and there's no issue with this layering. I noticed imporovement within days in terms of my skin's texture and acne.

This is a very good blow dryer. It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!	2015-08-15

The product itself looked great until i started spreading it on my skin. There are hard chunks of something in it that actually hurt to apply to my skin. Ive used Model Co. products before and i love them but this product was a complete fail for me. I got mine in champagne and it was actually a bit darker then most champagne colors.

My reason for trying emu oil was for sun damage. My skin has always been oily in the T-zone so to apply oil to my face seemed counter intuitive, but in fact my skin has responded well to emu oil. The oil is milky in appearance, very light weight, and absorbs quickly. I don't use very much (about one or two drops for my entire face) and I don't use it every day, but so far it has made my skin very soft and hasn't caused any breakouts. I'm pleasantly surprised and will continue to use.	2015-08-15

Anyone using Proactive really needs to take caution with this product. Firstly, it doesn't clear everyone's skin, it's not a miracle potion.<br /><br />If it does clear your skin, the results may only be temporary. When I used this product a few years ago for small blemishes, they cleared up for 1 month and came back with rage, still while using proactive.<br /><br />When I discontinued the product, I broke out even more. Thankfully, my skin was able to repair itself with a lot of TLC, and is fully repaired now, but people need to be careful with Proactive.	2015-08-15

I will start this by saying when I purchased this stencil kit I was expecting a stencil like I used in school, similar to the picture on the package on one solid piece. So when the package was about the size of my hand I was surprised.  These are individual stencils, one design per sheet and they are very nice sized, not too big, not too small.  This particular pack of stencils had a lot of really cute designs that were both kid and adult friendly.  The stencils themselves remind me of stickers, but they aren't paper.  They're basically three pieces, a sticky clear sheet, a flexible, thin plastic piece that works as the actual stencil, and the white paper backing.  You remove the white backing, apply the stencil to the skin (make sure it's clean and dry), get all of the bubbles out of the stencil itself and peel off the clear plastic covering.  You have now applied your stencil.  I found that it was very easy to apply and equally easy to remove, although you have to be careful when removing in order to maintain the beauty of the smaller details of the tattoo.  I was disappointed to see that these are not reusable, they are one time use only.  Of course being a frugal lady I did try to reuse one (on my daughter so it wasn't gross or anything haha) and I think it turned out okay.  It didn't lay down well so there were definitely lumps and bumps but it was okay and would work in a pinch if you have two kids that want the same tattoo.<br /><br />Pros: Sturdy, sticky, application and removal is simple. Fun variety of designs, something for everyone.<br />Cons: Nothing really, besides the fact that they are really one-time-use only<br /><br />Overall this is a great product.  I did receive this product for a discount in order to give my unbiased review.  I'd recommend this product for all ages!	2015-08-15

If the remaining five work just as well this is a great buy.  No instructions of how to fill but I had used something similar before.  The metal base slid off fairly easily and the the glass refill unscrewed.  Easy enough to just put my perfume spray up against the bottle opening and keep pumping until you fill it or put however much you want in it.  Put it back together and the spray was as good as the original perfume bottle.  Love that there are different colors so that I can mentally match them to the type of scent I am putting in them i.e.  favorite color, favorite scent, red - seductive, pink - flowery, etc.  Ordered another set straight away as they will be great stocking fillers.	2015-08-15

I like the scent as well, although at some times it can be a bit strong like I am wearing too much perfume. If you have problems with dry hair I would definitely give this a shot.	2015-08-15

Definitely not comparable to Bare Minerals. I can't wear this alone, as it shows every crease and pore. It doesn't apply as well, and I even used the same brush. It's lighter than I expected it to be, and I have very fair skin. However, I bought some Naked brand liquid base, which I love, and I wear this as a sort of &#34;mineral veil&#34; over top of that. It does a pretty good job as a powder instead of a base. I probably won't buy it again, but at least I can use what I bought.	2015-08-15

I had been using a more expensive brand of mouthpieces for my 'night grinding'.  Although these are one size fits all and are not adjustable, I still feel they are a great deal.

Depending on which BB cream, I might repeat layering on top lightly to try minimize anything &#34;settling&#34; in.<br />I also like to use this as a base for my lips, applying in a very sheer way it provides something to stick to, gives a fuller look and lets the color blossom.	2015-08-15

Why are we females so gullible? The directions say to apply over your day cream. The blurring of lines and pores I guess they think is a result of a very fine grate of glitter in this product, although nothing is actually blurred by it. This product actually accenuates dry, rough skin instead of smoothing it as claimed. It leaves a chalky appearance wherever you have slightly flakey skin. I have tried it in many different combos to see if I could get it to work, but no-go. I even tried it on bare skin this morning to check it out one last way before this review, and do you know it pilled on half of my face even still. I could'nt believe this is such a poor performing primer type product. And to add insult to injury it cost almost $20 for 1 ounce. Ladies: be smarter than I was. Don't believe the hype on this face goop. The only thing it does is mattify, and it does not even do that as advertised (&#34;provides all day matte finish). Unless maybe you have a 2 hour day over in your world.  In my world, all day means all day. It takes most people 9 hours to get through their day and come home after work (8hours work + 1hour lunch). I now believe that anyone who gave this a glowing review is affiliated with this company in some advertising capacity.  I think we ladies need to learn how to recognize product -propaganda a little better, and stop believing anything these beauty product companies say about the mostly useless crap we spend a lot of our money on. Instead lets invest that same money in something useful for us or our children.	2015-08-15

Body washes often follow this trend, but Axe White Label Body Wash is a little different. It gets you clean with a fresh but not overbearing scent and it can be used on the hair or body, for maximum convenience.<br /><br />Axe products have made their way into my home more than once and I have been satisfied with most of them. This 2 in 1 body wash and shampoo is as good as the rest, with a scent that is cologne- like, but with added aromas such as citrus and lavender. The manufacturer claims there are other scents present like wood, pralines, etc. but the ones I notice are cologne, citrus, and lavender. Okay, perhaps some wood but pralines?- I don’t know where they get that. The overall smell is pleasant and it’s neutral enough that the ladies in the home might even consider a squirt when in a pinch.<br /><br />Axe White Label 2 in 1 hair and body wash is purple in color, applies easily, and washes clean with no residue. I normally don’t like to use these 2 in 1 products on my hair, but this one actually does a decent job with cleaning the hair and scalp. Of course, I don’t have as much hair as other people so my opinion on the matter may not carry much weight. But it does work well for this purpose and that means you don’t need a separate shampoo.<br /><br />Axe makes lots of good, dependable men’s personal care products and Axe White Label 2 in 1 hair and body wash ranks among them. It’s less pricey than others and it does a good job getting you clean with a nice but not overwhelming scent. I like it enough to buy it again and I think most will agree that it’s as good as any other men’s body gel on the market.	2015-08-15

My hair texture changed to baby-fine during chemotherapy. I have tried many different<br />products but my hair was lifeless and /or dry after using them. Today I used Kerastase Age Recharge for the first time and thought I might have to use it a few times to see and feel results. However, after blowing my hair dry, I was elated. With no leave-in conditioners or styling products--only shampoo and this conditioner--my hair is fuller, shinier and has more weight. What a happy day after months of searching for a product that did what I needed.	2015-08-15

That probably has something to do with all the shea butter, sunflower oil, and aloe vera juice in it. There's no way for me to know all the proportions of everything used in the mud, but I'd bet all the added oils combined account for most of what's in that jar. Wish it felt as though there was more just straight up salt mud in there... Regardless, if you're looking for an afternoon of soft skin, this stuff's pretty bomb.	2015-08-15

I wore a beard for many years but recently decided to go clean shaven. I remembered using a Norelco as well as one of these in the past. So first I  went ahead and bought the top of the line Norelco a month ago, with the auto cleaner and all that, and what I found was that it didn't work very well. It takes forever with the circular movement and just doesn't shave all that close. I was getting 5 o'clock shadow at noon. As for the Panasonic, I remember that I picked this shaver up in college when my roommate said that it had the most powerful motor available and that meant it could cut the hairs quickly without snagging or causing any irritation. I don't know if that's true. What I do know is that I decided to revisit this shaver, and while it's not perfect, it really does shave close and it does it pretty quickly. So keep up the good work Panasonic.	2015-08-15

Rich antioxidant to rejuvenate and moisturize the skin and hair. 0.5 Fl.oz.- 15 ml. by Botanical Beauty	Beauty	4	18	18	N	N	good moisturizer	I was recently introduced to the wonderful world of essential oils and thus am always on the look out for new carrier oils. There were 2 things that surprised me about this oil. One was the size. The amount is much smaller than other oils I have used! At 0.5fl oz (15mL), there isn't a lot of product to go around so I suppose you should use it sparingly. Two was the smell. This oil has a very unpleasant aroma and I would not recommend using it straight from the bottle unless you're able to ignore it. I mix in a drop of peppermint or cinnamon oil and the smell is completely negated.<br /><br />The bottle claims that organic primrose oil is one of the best oils to rejuvenate and regenerate skin tissues, and seeing as I sometimes have eczema flare-ups on my hands, I was interested to see if it could do anything to help. My eczema is a mild case (assuming from the pics on google). I spread some of the evening primrose oil on the affected areas and examined my hand a few hours later. Of course I wasn't magically cured anything, but the oil did help to moisturize the area and relieve dryness. Maybe with continued use it could help but I'm honestly not expecting this to be a miracle eczema treatment since thus far, only hydrocortisone creams seem to have any sort of effect. But if you're looking for a moisturizer and wish to forgo the steroid creams, this one will work well to relieve some of the eczema symptoms. I received this product at a discount (not for free) in exchange for my unbiased opinion.	2015-08-15

I am now a 'lifer' and would recommend this product to anyone!<br />I am a redhead with very fair skin (thanks pops for that Irish/English touch you added - I don't think a drop of my mom's olive complexion reached my DNA.) This combination of genetics, and super-sensitive skin puts a person at the greatest risk for Rosacea.<br />. I have been using this product, along with the facial cleanser, for 6 days...I am simply amazed at the change in my skin<br /><br />I will say straight out that I paid Amazon's regular price for this product, and did not receive any type of 'deal' from the company...I have read enough criticisms of BioFitness for offering this at a discount for favorable reviews to wonder if THEY are writing to discrerdit this product, or<br />possibly the company. Hmm...just thinking out loud.<br />No matter...it works wonderfully for me, and I do understand that everyone is different. I only wish I had before and after pics to offer as evidence to the other 'skeptics' out there.<br /><br />ETA: It is 9/1/15, and you could never tell I have Rosacea! My skin is 95 % clear, with no bumps, and I do not need to use any cover-up powder on my face. This has been a miracle for me, and I only wish it worked as well for everyone else.<br />Great product!!<br /><br />ETA: 10/6/2017  After using  Red Rock Rosacea Cream For over two years, I am still in love with this product!<br />I do have a flare-up occasionally, but with the cream, they are very short-lived. I have also discovered a few other triggers...the only one I can't avoid are windy days...and that is something I have to live with.<br /><br />I always keep the product on hand, and have discovered a new use for it...my arms began showing some small red bumps, and I figured I would try the magic on them...good decision!<br />So combining red rock and sunscreen, the problem has virtually disappeared! Did I mention I love this stuff?	2015-08-15

It feels very &#34;light&#34; on your skin- you can tell the difference when your skin is able to breathe!<br /><br />I prefer the Primal pit paste that is in the jar vs the stick- I feel it is easier to apply ( I like to really rub it in).

Unless you use tall, skinny nail polish bottles - like Sally Hansen Hard As Nails - your bottles will pop out of these holders.

I've heard only good things about Shea Butter but only until now do I get to see for myself the effects personally. Taking out of the envelope it was delivered in, was the white zip lock type bag, and inside was another, sealed plastic one with the product. I was very happy that it was packaged this way, because when it arrived, it was squishy and watery! This is the way I've learned that for sure, that this product is truly organic and natural, because when in warm weather, the product will melt. It's quite fascinating! I know that coconut oil will do this as well.<br /><br />I didn't want to be scooping the product out of the bag every single time I wanted to use it, so what I did was stick it in the freezer for two hours or so, found a container that would fit it, cut the plastic with a knife, and stuck it in the container! I left it in a warm spot, and the shea butter started melting again, fitting perfectly into the container. Now I can use it properly!<br /><br />So far I have been using it as a body moisturizer, and it leaves my skin with a very pretty glow! I've never seen my skin below the neck look so dewy and fresh ... My face is already nice and dewy, but it always bothered me that my skin, no matter what I used on it, didn't have that same healthy shine! I'm also using it on my feet, as that is the place that needs the most hydration, and after just a few minutes of my skin soaking up the Shea Butter, I can definitely say that this is now one my miracle products. Shea butter literally IS skin food!!<br /><br />As for any grittiness, it definitely is there... I initially thought it was because some parts might have been frozen, but when it melted completely, they were still there and I quickly realized I was mistaken. For that reason, I won't be using it on my face, as i'm very afraid of scarring. But to be honest, I expected the grittiness, as should have anyone who took away a star for it. It does say &#34;unrefined&#34; in the title for a reason. I will only be using this on my body, as that is more than good enough for me!  I am truly very happy with this product.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.ll only be using this on my body, as that is more than good enough for me!

Her doctor wants me to give her Benadryl every night before she goes to bed. I do not want to give her chemicals to make her pass out, she is only 5. This lavender essential oil is great for helping her relax and fall asleep naturally. I place a few drops on her pillow and diffuse it in her room at night.

I really liked this muscle relief gel. It's not thick and pasty like some other brands. It goes on nice (you don't need a lot!) and quick. And you can instantly smell the essential oils. I did feel some tingling when applied to my shoulders and didn't have as much on my neck. Which is common as different areas are more sensitive. It still helped relieve the soreness!  I would highly recommend this product to someone looking for a more natural muscle relief cream!<br />I received this at a discount for my honest review.	2015-08-15

It is great for those who work out and either don't want to lose their ring or damage it due to lifting weights. Honor's Eternity Ring is also perfect for people who work in a field where wearing your wedding ring endangers your life due to machinery, electricity, etc. Some companies forbid jewelry for this reason so this silicone ring would be perfect. I chose this ring in purple and love it because it has more of a girly feel (although it is geared towards men).    Personally, I can't wear my wedding ring due to painful/swollen joints so I love the fact that this ring gives me something to wear. For those of us with allergies, it's also hypoallergenic and should be safe to wear for most people. It can also be worn in water without any thought of damage and it will also dry so that you finger is not wet underneath. It's durable and should something happen to your ring, it has a lifetime guarantee! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This review is my own opinion and what I truly thought of this item.	2015-08-15

Second time buying - I watched Dr. Oz discuss how this can really work on cellulite; I'm a believer! While it may not get rid of all of it (or a really bad case); I did see a noticeable difference. I mix it w/olive oil, essential oil, Himalayan Sea Salt - I love the way my skin feels when I rinse. It is easily cleaned-up in the shower; you will want to apply it there because otherwise you may have a real mess (it kind of spatters if the consistency isn't perfect). Be sure to buy an essential oil - it's quite smelly (not in a pleasing way) otherwise. Far less expensive to make your own mixtures than buy the store bought ready-made; it's also fun. The company sent me an email with both a recipe book and prior to my second order I also received a GREAT promo savings....but I was going to buy it again regardless. Actually this is probably one of the BEST companies I've purchased from on Amazon over the years; there have been many. Thank you.	2015-08-15

I have never used this kind of sponge before and I was pretty excited when I received it. I came in a package in a clear package with directions and recommendations. I really like how I was able to tear the sealed package open to know that no one else had used this sponge (you never know!). When you first touch the sponge, it's hard as a rock and it definitely feels like a volcanic rock or something. I soaked this sponge for a few minutes in water to get it wet and its hard rock texture turned into a very soft texture. I use my Clarisonic on a daily basis but it's definitely a nice change to use a softer sponge instead to cleanse my face. This is perfect if you're breaking out and you don't want to irritate your acne and skin by rough cleansing. I squirted my cleansing directly onto my sponge and spread it evenly all over my face before working the product into my skin in circular motions. It's definitely very soft to the skin and feels very nice. It doesn't completely remove all of your make up though because after cleansing my face, I used a toner and there was still makeup residue so definitely have to take that into consideration. When you're done using the sponge, it comes with a string attached to it so you can hang it up to air dry (very convenient!). Overall, it's a great alternative to cleansing your skin and I'll be using this sponge when I have acne breakouts. I would recommend giving this unique sponge a try! I really like it so far. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-15

FAIL	This product gets only 1 star from me.<br /><br />The color was matched by my own perception in the store while comparing my color to the box, which was the closest match, and also by the color selector on Garnier's website matching tool before I even applied the color. I thought with the double assurance, what could go wrong? I was only wanting to color a few premature grey hairs!<br /><br />I have long hair so I grabbed 2 boxes of the color 30, which is a dark brown.<br /><br />My hair is virgin hair with no previous color added to it or modified in any way.<br /><br />I followed all directions, which were simple. Apply it, wait, rinse, condition.<br /><br />When I rinsed, it looked like my natural color, but I was horrified when my hair was completely dry the next morning. I wanted to cry. My hair looked brown but very lighter and with a major tint of orange.<br /><br />How could a product that matched closely to my natural color make my hair LIGHTER? Well I don't have the answer, so I have no clue.<br /><br />I will attach some photos which will show my natural roots against the boxed color. MAJOR difference.<br /><br />Oh, and the greys were only covered for about a week. So all of this wrongdoing was done for absolutely nothing.	2015-08-15

Even for WOC hair types	I decided to buy wen because  my naturally curly hair and NYC humidity hasn't been  getting along. I am a black (hispanic/carribean) woman with color treated 3c/4a hair. The last time I used Wen my hair was texturized (kiddie relaxer) and it  softened, conditioned, decreased shedding, strenthened, and retained the color of my hair.  So I  figured I would try it on my natural hair as it seriously needed a remedy.  I do not use Wen as prescribed because my hair is way too long and thick for a few pumps.  I feel it out as I go, sectioning my hair into 4-6 parts and heavily conditioning each. I instantly felt the smoothing and repairing of my frizzy and dry hair. I then braid or twist each part.  Then I let the conditioner sit for anywhere to 10 min.- 24 hours, I then rinse it out (not all of it).  My curls were poppin lol shiny, moisturized, smooth (little to no frizz) .  Wen brought my hair back to life.	2015-08-15

I have pale white skin and am unable to tan so I have searched and used sunless tanners since the very first ones came out many years ago. Since the beginning, I have looked for one that gives a beautiful color (a soft natural light brown----not yellow or orange) and does not dry out the skin. This one fits those criteria but goes a step further: it does not darken the age spots that skin tends to get after we turn 30 or so. That in itself would have been enough to sell me but the color is so beautiful and my skin is not dry so this one is definitely my all-time fave.<br />I sincerely hope this product is around for a very long time!	2015-08-15

This razor is shipped from China so it took awhile to get, but still got it before promised date. I've been using this for about two weeks now.<br /><br />First impression this razor feels heavy, surprisingly well made for what I paid. If bought in a store in the U.S. This feels like a 30 dollar razor. Nice ergonomics for my thick hands.<br /><br />As for how it works? I let my beard grow for a few days, I looked like grizzly Adams by then. So I tried the razor hoping it wouldn't be too painful. Some cold water, thick beard Barbasol, and ten minutes later, my chubby face is as smooth as a baby's bottom. No nicks, very little deep pulling.<br /><br />Couple of days later my five o clock shadow is back, I'm quite hairy, but not much so the double edge went pretty deep. Replacement blades is the only draw back, about 16 bucks a pack. Tip of the day. Keep the blade dry after use by removing it after use and dry them thoroughly each time and each blade should last more than a few months.	2015-08-15

My friends are always looking to find a local sales person to buy it from and act like they just can't live without it. So I decided to give it a go. I was a bit surprised to find out that you use it along with regular mascara. The product is easy enough to apply. You put on regular mascara, then a coat of the gel (black like mascara) then a coating of the fibers. The fibers look like tiny chopped off pieces of lint (but not in a ball) Then another coat of the gel. It says apply as many coats as needed. I gave it a shot and I think it did well for some extra volume, but I don't see a huge difference. I put regular mascara on one eye and used the 3D on the other. I guess if you have thin eye lashes it will help out a lot, but I didn't see a huge length difference. The little pieces fell off a couple times before I got the gel on and fell in my eye, which didn't hurt too bad, so try and move quickly and not blink. I see why my friends like it as a few of them have very sparse lashes, so it helps them, but I don't see a huge difference for myself. My husband couldn't guess which eye had my regular cover girl and which eye had the 3D.<br /><br />Update: My sister in law loves it. She says she can see a big difference in her eyelashes. She has light colored lashes and says this helps her out. The product works well for her, so I am updating this review.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE TO TRY OUT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

I've used various plastic ones, but some don't seem to work well and they get dirty. I regularly cleaned my plastic tongue scrapers but after a while they just got gross and I had to dispose of them. I purchased this one because I like the idea of ayurvedic, and I want something that will last a long time! I love the copper, it's super easy to use, both one and two-handed. It grips the tongue very well and really does a great job removing icky build up on the tongue. It also travels well, it's also very easy to keep clean! There is no handle, or other type object to make cleaning difficult, it's ideal and I'm a fan!	2015-08-15

I did a lot of research before I bought the Body Merry Retinol Moisturizer.  I was impressed by all the reviews, so I ordered my first bottle.  Previously, I was using Clinique's serum which was about $50 per bottle.  It did a good job of smoothing my skin, but I still had dark spots that didn't quite fade.  Right away, I loved the feel of my skin after using Body Merry for a couple of days.  After using for a month, I felt convinced that this worked as well  if not better than the more expensive Clinique product.  All of my friends talk about how young I look.  A big part of that is genetics, but I like having this product in my arsenal for minimizing fine lines and evening skin tone.  This is a great product fom a great company. My hubby bought me a groupon for a facial.  I went to the salon (my first ever). and the aesthetician asked what I used, then looked up the ingredients, and wrote down the name.  She said that the ingredients were wonderful and that she was going to look into the products for herself!	2015-08-15

Best to Reduce Scars, Wrinkles, Age Spots, & Aging Skin for Younger Look. KFDA Approved. #1 Vitamin C Serum Guaranteed!"	Beauty	5	2	3	N	Y	I am 52 YOA and my skin looks wonderful and radiant	I did not review last week since I had just received the serum and I wanted to be accurate in my review.  I had been carefully looking for a Vitamin C Serum, since so many oxidize quickly. Yellow is not what you want in your Vitamin C Serum; it means it has oxidized. I had some recommendations, but the reviews were touted as being unstable thus oxidizing quickly; in fact, before receipt of the product. Thus after reading Red Serum reviews I decided to purchase it. I have been using it for one-week and have noticeably smoother, even tone, and brighter skin. I have used many Vitamin C serums and other products, but this is one of the first products I have seen a noticeable difference so quickly. I do hope the positive changes in my skin will continue. I am 52 YOA and my skin looks wonderful and radiant. I keep the serum in the refrigerator since Vitamin C products oxidize quickly.  I highly recommend this product. I am going to order another bottle after I submit this review.	2015-08-15

Cucumber Aloe Vera Lotion With Vitamin C,D,E Non-Comedogenic, Water Resistant	Beauty	5	3	4	N	Y	The BEST facial sunscreen/moisturizer available...perfect for very sensitive or rosacea prone skin	The BEST facial sunscreen I've ever used! I have extremely sensitive facial skin as well as rosacea. I've tried a myriad of facial sunscreens over many years. All have caused a burning sensation & have flared my rosacea. This exceptional facial sunscreen literally soothes my skin when I apply it- it feels like a cool soft cucumber has been applied all over my face. Since using the Rejuvelle Facial Sunscreen, my rosacea redness, small &#34;bumps&#34; & skin flakiness has improved dramatically. Additionally, this is a wonderful facial moisturizer & my mineral makeup flows softly across my face when applying. My skin is so soft now- even the little wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable. I highly recommend Rejuvelle Facial Sunscreen & encourage anyone who's looking for a superior facial sunscreen/moisturizer to purchase this product.<br /><br />Andrea Paul, RN, CCM<br />Scottsdale, AZ	2015-08-15

Beauty	5	26	27	N	N	Best fiber lashes i ever used	To give you a little background on myself, I'm a freelance makeup artist who worked for sephora for 5 years, and on my own for an additional 5. I've tried pretty much all the mascaras sephora carries, and then also shop at department stores, ulta, and occasionally a drugstore I even included a pic of the current mascaras I'm using, I normally switch back and forth, or use a combo of two or three, this is my current batch. This mascara is the s***. Excuse my language, but before this one, one of my favorite mascaras was a line that rhythms with &#34;Too Maced&#34; and it was their two part mascara, with the first one being a normal mascara, and the second being a bottle of white fibers you stacked on top. Now I loved this mascara, it gives the biggest longest lashes I had ever gotten, not wearing fake lashes, but my issue was it was a huge pain in butt to take off So I used it for special occasions, when I wanted to look good, but I was gonna have to spend an hour taking off my make up anyway. This mascara is WAY easier to take off, and they made the fibers black, which was a &#34;duh&#34; moment for me, like of course make it black, you're gonna paint over it anyway! So this 3d fiber mascara is a little tricky to put on at first (unless you've used the other brands, then it's the same thing) you first put on a layer of the regular black mascara (transplanting gel I think they call it) and IMMEDIATELY take the fibers and brush it on, over and under You'll see the fibers stick and your lashes will look twice as big soon as you do it Then I move to the next eye, repeat the process, this gives the gel and fibers a second to dry and stick together.. Then you can't repeat the process as many times as you want, you can get them really quite big, but make sure you seal the fibers in with a final coat of the gel mascara If you don't you'll have little black fibers all over your face and they aren't cute, or easy to get off, without getting rid of the rest of your makeup. Invent shut up about this mascara since I tried it, it's really that good. I love the way it makes them look not only longer, but so much fuller and fluffier! I tried to get good pictures of my lashes, before, after the gel, then after gel, fiber, gel, fiber, gel, but turns out taking a picture of your eye close up is kinda hard, so I'll take more next time I paint my face. Obviously I'm a very happy customer. THIS PRODUCT WAS PURCHASED WITH A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION. but this stuff is really freaking good and I'll be buying more.our makeup.

They were delivered promptly and in great condition.  I really appreciate the packaging - they were in a zip top plastic case - very nice for storing or carrying them.  NICE touch!  I have filled a couple of the bottles already.  They have a small opening, so the funnel is a nice tool.  The edges of it seem a bit sharp, I don't think you can get cut, but be careful.  I think it is plastic, not metal.<br />If you have any trouble getting the rollers on the top of the bottle, just remember to let the lid of the bottle do the work for you.  They are a little stiff at first, so give the lid a chance to tighten it down for you.  I love the cobalt blue of the bottles.<br />A nice product,  and I will be ordering more in the future.	2015-08-15

Let me start with the removable filter which allows you to  clean the dust out, my previous dryers did not have this option and the filter would clog diminishing the airflow and the drying ability. That is why this is such an important feature to me,you would think all hair dryers would have it!<br />Now to its features: it has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings (*wish there were 3!)<br /> annnd a &#34;cool shot&#34; which Iove, Love, LOVE! I have very thin, fine hair and when I set my hair with heat rollers I use the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature to speed up the &#34;set&#34; and my curls stay in longer as the hair is more cooled down before I take the rollers out so the curls don't fall out as quickly as they used to, my set lasts longer.<br />I use the concentrator but have no need for the diffuser but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have.<br />It has the heat protection &#34;ionic technology&#34; that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free, dries hair fast (I have long hair) and doesn't tangle it up when just doing a blow dry and not setting my curls.<br />It has a 2 year warranty and is at a GREAT price for what you get. I would recommend this dryer.	2015-08-15

So I think I have learned a lot from my experience with this hair chalk.<br /><br />The main lesson learned is that, depending on your hair type, you WILL get different results: If you have darker hair, you should wet your hair and the chalk and it should show up, but blonde hair is different. Ideally, you shouldn't use water because you run the risk of staining our hair (but some blonde hair doesn't absorb color well, so it does really depend on knowing your hair). My hair always absorbs color, so I tried to do it dry and it didn't work super well, and it still ended up staining my hair the lavender color of the chalk (but it came out in two washes, so it wasn't a big deal).<br /><br />Also, I used half a stick of lavender on just one streak of hair by my face because I have so much hair, so this product is ideal for shorter hair and thin streaks.<br /><br />Finally, I would recommend wearing gloves because it gets all over your hands (especially if you are wetting your hair or chalk). Plus, I would do this over a sink because the chalk will fall around you.<br /><br />I think this would be fun for kids who want funky streaks in their hair :)! I think I'll use this when I babysit, just probably not for myself due to my hair not being super compatible with their temporary coloring product.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful!	2015-08-15

After about a year or so of using it about 4-5 times a week the display said to replace the shaver head, so I purchased a new one and was very disappointed.  The new one pulled my facial hair and didn't shave nearly as smooth as the original head.  I gave it a chance and used it for about 2 weeks, but if I didn't shave every day it would painfully remind me that I didn't shave the day before.  Ultimately I went back to the original head that came with it.	2015-08-15

For short business trips, my husband can pack the F2 with him and, fully charged, he can easily travel multiple days without worrying about needing to recharge it. This shaver has a 30 minute runtime, and for him as he has a beard, that is easily a week's worth of shaving.<br /><br />The pop-up trimmer works well to trim tray hairs on his beard and sideburns, while the foil shaver does an good job on his neck and cheek areas that he shaves regularly. The result on his neck is remarkably smooth for an inexpensive shaver.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good value for a lightweight and inexpensive shaver. It works well on my husband's face and he assures me that it would work well for most men looking for a nice basic shaver or for someone looking to give an inexpensive gift.	2015-08-15

I deducted 1 star because this formula doesn't work well under makeup because it doesn't spread very well.  You have to apply pressure during application in order to spread and blend it.  There's also the white cast issue that you typically get from mineral base sunscreens but if you were able to wear this under your makeup it wouldn't be much of an issue but since you can't minus half a star.  However, this is a great sunscreen if you don't wear makeup.  There's no stinging and drying effect and it also doesn't make you oily. I wear this on days where I don't wear makeup and also on my neck and chest.  I also use it on arms and legs and it moisturizes without feeling oily and sticky.  I would buy again for that purpose.  If you want a sunscreen to wear under your makeup, skip this option but by no means is this a bad sunscreen.	2015-08-15

I grew up in a household that used Dove White bar soap and what an outstanding brand. I love gifting these box sets for Christmas. For me personally the shampoo is my least favorite product in the Dove line. It simply does nothing for my hair. That aside the body wash and bar soap are the gold standard of toiletries.	2015-08-15

I purchased this for my 17 year old daughter who changes her hair color weekly...so her hair is quite dry as you can imagine.  She loves it, her hair loves it and I love it.  Its still as good as it was back when I was much younger.  The only problem I had was not by any fault of the maker but the shipper...the bottle was partially open so it leaked all over the place.  This needs to be fixed if I am ever to purchase this from here again.	2015-08-15

It's VERY red which was a little too much for my more natural red hair. I ended up mixing it with corn starch (picked up the idea from Pintrest). The applicator is not my favorite. After opening once, I was never able to get the top back on and using it to apply the dry shampoo was difficult to regulate. Again, ended up coming up with a work around solution. Having said all of that, I would buy the product again. The workarounds took minimum effort and I got the results I wanted.	2015-08-15

I have used every imagineable concealer, corrector + concealer, powder 'concealer', under eye brightener, etc.  For literally decades I accepted the caking and more than gradual aging not to mention the magnified look of crepiness once I started using readers.  Initially received this product as a 2 for 1 through a shopping network.  Zero issues with the case or delivery system.  My two tubes lasted almost a year.  I apply to the back of my hand then use a concealer brush or fingertip to apply under eyes, around the nose, and very lightly on broken capillaries or spots.  The texture of my under eye skin has greatly improved even though I have always used high end eye serum/cream.  This concealer is more of a natural looking camouflage.  On my face I apply a similar type of serum foundation then the Touche Veloutee where needed.  Under eyes I apply directly to the dark areas, no foundation or powder.  On eyelids less is best to neutralize tea stains and redness.  Wish the 2 for 1 offer was still available.  Paying the full price now because it is that great.  To the person who complained about too many clicks to get the product out, send back for an exchange.  Normally one pump lasts thru multiple applications.  One of my tubes dried out after spending the summer in a cottage without AC.  The other one stayed perfect until it was completely empty.	2015-08-15

I've had nail fungus for years and have battled it half-heartedly every so often. This time I decided that I will make more of an effort and really get rid of it by ensuring that I was faithful and aggressive using the products every day. I purchased several nail fungus treatments including a foot soak. I'd often see reviews how the toenails take six to eight months to grow out and never agreed with it. My toenails always grew quickly even when removing the brown hardened and brittle nails from the nail bed. It wasn't unusual for it to grow back within a couple of weeks. I guess it grew quickly because of the fungus.<br /><br />It's been a month between this product and another product that smells like oregano along with the foot soak. My nails have not grown back yet. My big toe bed on my right foot was always the worst and when clipping the brown nails, you could see that the toe bed was brown/black and the fungus was part of the skin. I was able to do this because most of the nail separated from the toe bed. Since most of my toenail on my right foot is gone I can see the results more quickly than the other toes. The brown/black used to run from the bottom to the top, but now it's only at the bottom and I can see that the fungus goes really deep. I put a Band-Aid on to protect my exposed toe bed during the day after I allow the product to dry.<br /><br />I can't believe my nails haven't grown back yet.I guess the fungus is being killed off and once that happens my nails will start to grow back. I'll update again in six months.	2015-08-15

I I have dry, sensitive skin so it is hard to find a moisturizer that adequately hydrates without irritating my face.  I was really hopeful that this moisturizer would work, especially because it is so highly rated. Unfortunately, my experience has not been so pleasant. Although the product does leave my face feeling really soft, the feeling does not last. I find myself continuously having to reapply the moisturizer though-out the day( 5-6 times) because my face gets dry again rather quickly.<br /><br />In addition, after a couple of days I started breaking out on my cheeks, which from past experience with other products I know to be from irritation. This was my red flag and I immediately discontinued usage. After a couple of days the bumps on my cheeks subsided. I am really disappointed because I absolutely love the ingredients. I think this product would be a better fit for someone with oily skin but not for those with dry or sensitive skin.	2015-08-15

I recommend getting the spray applicator as it makes it much easier to apply exactly where you want it with no waste.  The only drawback is that the black color is a very matte, jet black color, not a soft black.  I will probably have to order some dark brown and mix them together.  Otherwise, great!

This is the  first time I've tried Splat, and I have to say I'm pleased. I used the color Lusty Lavender and love the way it came out. ' Of course as with any semi-permanent hair dye it's fading pretty quickly, but it is fading into a pretty pinkish purple. It's always a plus for it to fade to a pretty color rather than something dull and not so pretty. Yes, the color did stain my pillowcase and some articles of clothing, but nothing major. Going solely off of my own experience this is an overall great semi-permanent hair dye.	2015-08-15

This product works nicely for thin hair and kudos to brands, like this one, for limiting the chemicals... But the Ingredients List should be listed for consumers. It's not 100% organic obviously so consumers should naturally expect some chemical derivatives. For those who care for more info or who assume it's free of harsh chemicals, here's the list with a breakdown of the mysterious items:<br /><br />Aqua/Eau/Water,<br /><br />PVP Copolymer: A petrolium derived chemical.<br /><br />Alkylpolyglucosides: Surfactant derived from sugar and fats.<br /><br />Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate: Extraction process where the oil is separated out for use with petrochemicals and other chemical solvents. The extraction is followed by extensive processing and forced reactions with synthetic chemicals (usually several reactions with several chemicals), which transforms the ingredient until a foam boosting chemical surfactant is produced.<br /><br />Polysorbate-20: A chemical emulsifier regarded as safe.<br /><br />Methyl Gluceth-20 (derived from corn starch/corn sugars),<br /><br />Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate: A chemical UV Filter<br /><br />Organic Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil,<br />Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract,<br />Organic Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract (UV Inhibitors),<br />Rice Amino Acids,<br /><br />PCA: Sodium<br /><br />Panthenol B5,<br />Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E),<br />Glycereth-2 Cocoate & Benzoic Acid,<br /><br />Parfum/Fragrance: Not specified so most likely chemical based.	2015-08-15

US	31036804	R2WA7Y33O2GT20	B00HB2ARDU	77657684	Philips Norelco BeardTrimmer 5100, for beard stubble and mustache	Beauty	5	35	37	N	Y	the head for the detail edge	I have only owned one other beard trimmer...a Remington from Costco.  I had nothing to compare to, and thought that making multiple passes through my moderately thick beard and mustache were normal, and that pulling hair, particularly on the mustache was normal.  When the Remington gave up I had no idea the number of choices out there!.....and multiple ones from the same brand.  There are so many reviews where people say they would never own a Norelco, Panasonic, Wahl etc again, and many more who said it was the best trimmer they ever owned.  Reviews from Men's Health and other sites were also all over the map.  So  here is a review to help you decide.<br />I finally decided on this trimmer based on moderate price, well over 55% 5 star reviews and not too many 1 star reviews.<br />I'M GLAD I took the chance! This little beauty is great!<br /><br />PROS<br />1.  The obvious..a great one pass (maybe two in a couple places),  very even, non pulling shave.  (I mean, isn't that the real test?)<br />2.  Simple simple simple!  I really like a narrow detail side for above my lip, over my ears (no I don't use it for haircut, just a little touch up before the regular haircut)  so having the head rotate into position smoothly and securely, without having to CHANGE heads is great!  (The two heads are on the same non-removable end--very secure)<br />3.  Also on the simple side---ONE comb!  I was forever trying to read the small length markings on the TWO  double sided combs on the old one, and they didn't snap on and off easily.  You just put the one ONE comb on and adjust from a half inch or so beard, all the way down to a 1 or 2 day stubble look depending on how fast your beard grows.  There are 17 selections, with many short selections.The rotating dial is smooth to operate, with detentes that let you know that you are &quot;on&quot; the setting.  Once there it stays put.<br />4.  The comb only has to be removed when you rotate the head....not to change lengths.  It looked too rounded at first, and the combs too thick.  Not so.  because of the design it doesn't poke, and separates the hairs nicely.  The comb attaches firmly into the trimmer, and comes on and off in such a way as to not stress the plastic.<br />5.  There is a charge indicator, and the charger charges fast.  The razor CAN be used while it is charging.<br />6.  Slender, ergonomic design, but not lightweight-  just the right weight in the hand---really well made.<br />7.  It's washable--not important for me, but might be for some.<br />8.  Blades don't need oil<br />9.  It's AMAZON...no my name is not Jeff Bezos, and I own no stock.  I had finally decided to return to Costco and buy whatever they had...It was a Norelco 7500 which they had at least 10 of the day before.  In it's place were TWO Norelco electric razors (not capable of beard trimming) and a Wahl multipiece, in case you want to go to work for Supercuts.  Ah, the old Costco curse--buy it when you see it--it may not be there by the time you circle the warehouse!  BUT, I went home, ordered from AMAZON about 8PM and it was (no joke!) on my doorstep at 10AM the next morning with free shipping.<br />CONS<br />1.  No stand---not a con for me---I like an uncluttered counter.  My old one HAD to charge in the stand, so I left it out sitting.  This one I just put in the drawer.<br />2.  No multiple attachments--again, not a con for me.  I didn't want a combination can opener- beard trimmer, or a bag of attachments, or a stand where they always fall off.  I suppose a nose hair trimmer would be nice, but I don't need one.  And then, you would lose the simplicity of the rotating permanently attached head.  Just pick up a nose hair trimmer guys. Amazon has them for as low as $7.75 (Wahl) and Hammacher Schlemmer has what looks like an amazing one for $20 if you have barbed wire growing out of your nose.  I was just genetically blessed with no back hair or nose hair--but I can empathize!<br />3.  No laser.  Really guys, a laser!I'm a gadget guy, but even I couldn't see the use of that!  Well maybe if I had multiple weird beard/goatee angles.  But then I'd feel like keeping it in my tool box, and who wants to run to the garage every time you need a shave?<br /><br />In conclusion---are there better trimmers out there?  I don't know, maybe, but I can't imagine a simpler one that does such a great job---oh did I say it was powerful too?  I do have to say I was a little curious to see what Norelco's $200 beard trimmer must be like, but not curious enough to lay out that kind of money.  this one is just perfect.	2015-08-15

I bought this because I thought it was the same and I wanted a pump bottle to take on the plane when I travel. This is not the same. At all. The only similarity is the scent. The aerosol spray goes on light and absorbs almost instantly with zero greasy feel after. This stuff is just gross. It's just argan scented baby oil and it stays sticky, slick and greasy for hours after application. My friend hugged me at lunch two hours after I had used it and cracked up laughing - she said my arms felt like I had stepped out of 1974. No thanks.	2015-08-15

The lotion comes with both the standard cap shown and a pump -- which I prefer to use. The standard cap isn't terribly hard to use, but due to the shape of the durable, firm bottle of the lotion, it is a bit inconvenient and awkward to squeeze the lotion out. Replacing it with the pump made the lotion come out effortlessly and much easier. The lotion itself smells pleasant -- light, clean, and not overwhelmingly strong. I was actually expecting a bit more of a masculine touch to it, but it's not feminine either so I'm okay with the smell. It's also described with a light citrus smell, but I can't really tell if it's even there; the cooling sensation also isn't there, which is a bit disappointing considering that's how the Water is advertised. Applying the lotion definitely leaves skin smooth and soft but there is also a bit of greasiness -- not much, but still noticeable.<br /><br />I received this lotion at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review.	2015-08-15

It does work to block armpit odors and for a long time too. But by the end of the day the scent turns a bit more earthy and somehow I feel this would be a better scent for a man. The product consistency is slightly grainy and definitely a weird and foreign way to put on deodorant. Take a pea size and rub it into your underarms. I would surely buy another one but in a different scent. I purchased this at a discount for my review	2015-08-15

I'm pretty young and it's embarrassing to say, but I have stretch marks on the side of my  thighs.  They are hideous to look at. I'm ashamed of the marks and how vivid they are.  When I wear my  bathing suit in the summer time, it's so apparent and humiliating.<br /><br />I received the bottle today. I smothered a bit on my thigh and then used the Derma roller to roll on the stretch marks.  Hopefully, in a few weeks time I won't ever have to see my stretch marks again.

But it's buildable too and works great with the beauty blender from sephora.<br /><br />I use color #4  and for comparison purposes I've used NARS groenland tinted moisturizer as well as NARS Barcelona powder And when I wore MAC powder I was medium beige.

I love that this product gets such a good rating from EWG.  I read many reviews of this brand before buying, and I have to agree with the posters who noted how difficult it is to sharpen this pencil.  The first time was not so bad- after that I lost about 25% of the pencil each time I tried to sharpen it (and I was trying hard to be careful!). I found it was easy to apply and stayed on pretty well, but at $15 it is just too expensive to buy again and lose so much at each sharpening.	2015-08-15

OK, this was a difficult one to rate.  This was my first experience with waxing and I expected that there might be some discomfort and/or pain.  I also noted other users saying how messy it was to use, yep that it was however, it did indeed remove the unwanted hairs (above lip).  On the other hand the pain was excruciating!  I am hardly a wimp but this was so painful when removing it that my eye's watered something fierce from the pain.  It looked like I was crying.  It didn't leave any red marks and it removed 99% of all unwanted hairs.  Only a few remained to be plucked.  I would use this again if it wasn't for the pain.  It does say to press on the skin afterwards to lessen the pain but that is only temporary relief.  Four hours later, it was still painful but to the point I could ignore it easily.  Too bad, I really like how well it works but don't know if I'll use it again due to the pain.  Plucking is far less painful for me.	2015-08-15

It foams and rinses nicely, smells good. We use it for bubble bath and as body wash, which it does well for both. I don't know what language that other fruitcake was reading but there is NO sulfate listed in the ingredients.  There are dyes yellow 5 and red 33, but this is a topical product, not an ingested one so I don't see the issue there. At any rate, I like it and will be buying it again in other scents too.	2015-08-15

Pros: The battery life is good - I only have to charge this every couple of weeks using it every other day. The adjustable length is quite nice as well, especially with the digital display. The trimmer is also quite comfortable to use. This trimmer does the job decently well, but several gripes lower the rating.<br /><br />Cons: The vacuum collects some hair, but leaves a lot in the sink (even if you clean out the chamber between trimmings). It's better than a regular trimmer in this regard, but not quite as good as I'd hoped. The closure for the hair collection chamber is poorly designed - a small plastic tab holds it closed and mine broke off after about a month of gentle use. I now hold the door closed with a hair elastic which works okay, but not great. As for cutting quality, I find that I need to go over the same area several times to avoid leaving stray long hairs and the cut is not the cleanest. I suspect sharper blades would help here.<br /><br />Overall: This trimmer does a fine job for the price, but when it fully breaks I'll be looking for other options.	2015-08-15

Jose Eber flat iron have thought thru about their design.  This is a great iron and it works well for my coarse and thick hair.  Easy to control and great holding position where you can push your thumb without burning yourself.  It would get a five star if it has self turn off feature.  Ok,  I am reducing 4 to 2 star.  It started out nicely but the iron seems to starting to pull on my hair so much and perhaps the plate is no longer work well in 2 months.  The iron is on max high temp but did not do much for my hair (my hair is straight already).  no I would not recommend this product.	2015-08-15

I ordered this product because I have a Brazilian Blowout and it sounded like it would be a good shampoo and conditioner for the treatment. I used the shampoo and conditioner and I have to say that my hair looked wonderful. Straight and silky without being greasy...however...the perfume smell is so pungent and overwhelming that it gave me a horrible migraine. I am sensitive to scent and this scent is absolutely overpowering. I had to wash my hair FOUR times with my old products to get the smell out. I hated to waste the money, but I had to throw the products away. There is no way I would use them again or recommend them until they correct the scent issue. I really liked the results, but I absolutely can't get past that smell. If they reformulate it to either be unscented or toned down the amount of scent by about 95 percent, I would use it again, but unless they do that, I'll never use this product again. If you are sensitive to artificial fragrance or strong odors, this is probably not a good product for you.	2015-08-15

I had heard of the Vidal Sassoon London Luxe dye before entering the campaign. Specifically, I've heard great reviews of the shade London Lilac and had even considered choosing the shade myself to try. However, since I'm currently in a nursing program, the shade seemed too bold, so I had chose Dark Royal Chestnut instead. I had tried several brands of at home hair kits before. In comparison I found Vidal Sassoon London Luxe to be average. The method of application was like most brands, but I personally prefer a mousse or foam application instead of the cream consistency, since it's easier and quicker to apply. The colour pay off is great and it gave me a vibrant brown shade. There were no streaks or patches and the colour applied evenly. There's nothing bad to say about this product. It delivered as I expected and nothing bad or good stood out. I did notice however the retain price of this product, which is around $12, even though most drug store dye kits are often on sale to around $6. Honestly, I don't think I'll find myself purchasing this in the future, although I am REALLY tempted to the London Lilac, so that will be the only reason if I ever purchase this.	2015-08-15

I went to dip my fingers in and was met with resistance! I was taken back because I was expecting a smooth gel-type texture and I had to dig my nails in in order to apply the product. This smelled nothing like the other shea moisture products. It smelled like chemicals and rubber! I smoothed some of the &#34;gel&#34; on wet hair and all it did was frizz my hair up. I get better curl definition with just a leave in!<br /><br />This wasn't sticky and it's like it didn't want to mix with my hair or even stay on my fingers! I feel like I purchased a really bad batch based on the many positive reviews and the fact that all the other products I tried from this line were fabulous. I immediately washed that section of hair I applied the product on and returned it for a refund.<br /><br />I tried using it with the soufflé as I read that people got great results using them together and then using it on it's own. It was a frizzy, tangled mess.<br /><br />Can someone tell me if they experienced a similarity in texture/smell? I'm so inclined to think I grabbed an old jar off the shelf or is it because it has agave nectar and other natural ingredients so it won't be like a traditional gel?	2015-08-15

It absolutely works as advertised. I have noticed some reviewers seem to be confused by the fact that this is a powder, and they assume it is a dry shampoo. It is NOT a dry shampoo. The product will probably allow you to keep a style overnight, but it is definitely a volumizer that should be applied either directly to your ROOTS not the entire hair shaft or to your fingers, which you then distribute where you want it on your roots. If you just shake it all over and expect it to work, it won't. It will make your hair coarse and slightly sticky.<br /><br />How I use it on short, fine hair: I apply gel or spraygel to damp hair, then blowdry as usual. Then I apply this powder to my crown and the back/top of my head to create some lift. I sometimes even do spot applications if my hair is flatter in one spot than the other. Then spray, and I'm done! That's it. No need to blow this dry like a spray-in root lifter.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give this a shot. I would suggest shopping around to major drugstores and local retailers to get the best price, but this product goes a long way with a little applied, so it should last awhile. Also, it is a smallish can, perfect for traveling or carrying in a purse for quick touchups (although it works all day--I've never had to use it for a touchup).	2015-08-15

The holder is nice and tall to suit even long brushes, and it’s wide enough to hold quite a few brushes. The design of this holder is so cute! It’s floral and feminine, and the colors are so pretty. The pattern has a vintage kind of style to it, which really suits my tastes! The holder has snap button closures on each side of it which are very easy to open and to close. You can choose to keep the lid on the holder to keep your brushes safe and secure, or what I do is just leave the holder with my brushes open on the counter for easier access. Having a holder like this can be more convenient than a traditional makeup brush pouch because this type of holder makes the brushes easier to access, to remove from the holder and to put back. It’s also great for traveling! This is a very pretty and functional makeup brush holder! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-15

I suffer from mild generalized and social anxiety, so I pop one in every morning and can really tell the difference on the days when I forget to take one. They're great before again before an audition or work presentation, and help with flying and road trips since I tend to get motion sick. I also take three before bed to help my mind calm down a bit and have found that they do help me fall and stay asleep. Its great because they are non-habit forming, and I haven't experienced any negative side effects (knock on wood). Its also great because i can take as many as I need through out the day and not have to worry about overdosing ect, however I have found  that taking more than three at a time isn't really more effective.<br /><br />Calms Forte is not a sedative and is not meant to work like ambien or another sleeping pill of that variety. Its possible that people are confused over how they are marketed as a sleep aid, when the effects they provide (for me at least) are the relief of tension and anxiety, which then help me sleep better. Its not going to knock you out though, if thats what your looking for.	2015-08-15

I recently purchased the regular biore strip with no charcoal and I feel like the charcoal absorbed more than the original. My skin is always clean and smooth where I removed the strip. It feels good to the touch. There is often some black residue left on the skin afterwords, but it rinses off easily with water. What I can say is to make sure you wait until the strip has hardened on your face. If you take it off too soon, it will definitely cause discomfort.<br />If you are someone who deals with congested skin in the t-zone area, this is a wonderful solution. I will be going back to the charcoal once my new strip are used up.	2015-08-15

After  having several gel manicures that lifted in a week, I picked at, my nails were paper thin... I tried this because a friend had it. I didn't love the color she had, but my nails were strong. I went to Amazon, read the reviews and got the idea to just use the top coat (step 3-glaze). I read reviews for other products too and came up with this routine that has made nails stronger than ever before, even when I had a new gel manicure.<br />2 coats of OPI Nail Envy... then 1 or 2 coats of my color (not L'Oreal's gel), then a coat of L'Oreal Step3 glaze. A day or 2 later I add another coat of OPI Nail Envy or the Step 3. My nails are healthier than they've ever been.	2015-08-15

I felt that it left my eyes more dried out. I didn't use them faithfully everyday but when I did use them, my eyes seemed to feel uncomfortable to me.

I already have dry eyes, contacts don't help, but the liguigel wasn't keeping my eyes moist at all. Refresh Optive is a thicker consistency than this one.

Ladies should not neglect the delicate skin on their necks and d&eacute;colletage, but applying really expensive face creams there feels extravagent. Based on the reviews and ingredients I decided to try this cream. I recognize the ingredients, and the smell, which is not unpleasant. It has not irritated my sensitive skin, and keeps the moisture level high. I apply this to my neck, d&eacute;colletage and the backs of my hands, then usually put another cream over it, especially in winter, to lock in the moisture. My skin looks great, feels hydrated and some of those very fine lines that middle aged ladies start finding on their d&eacute;colletage have been reduced. It is not a miracle cream, but I try many creams in my quest to defy the appearance of age, and this is my second bottle, which means that I'm happy with the performance, and after running out of the original bottle, I noticed its absence. I do recommend this product for its natural ingredients, no nonsense packaging and a great price! I have not used it on my face, so I cannot attest to its performance in that area.	2015-08-15

On one hand, I like the lack of hazardous chemicals. This sunblock is deemed acceptable for use at many parks and resorts where they care about reef protection, so I like that about it. However, that's basically the only thing I like about it.<br /><br />The scent is very similar to Juicy Fruit gum, and it got annoying pretty fast. The texture is very greasy and pasty, and it did't really rub in the way normal sunblock does. You'd have to wash your hands after applying it, because it feels pretty gross until you do. It's very thick and white, and we had a hard time keeping it from getting all over our swimsuits.<br /><br />I also didn't like the packaging, as the sunblock is quite thick, and once the bottle is around half full, it gets hard to get it out. A tube that can be flattened would be much easier.  Still, the drawbacks are worth it if you're going to be swimming in a body of water where other creatures are affected by your choice of sunscreen. I definitely won't use it in pools, though.	2015-08-15

I have ordered several products from FOXBRIM. I have found all of them to be high quality and effective.  As for this Lavender I found it to be refreshing and the fact its natural makes it even better. I have bought the products I have from them because of what's listed on the front label. However, the back of the label is where I find most of the products I get even excited over.  Ingredients like Witch Hazel, Vitamin C, Organic Aloe Vera, Yucca, Sage, Pomegranate, and other all natural healthy for the skin and body ingredients.<br />I keep mine in my crochet bag.  I crochet all day, because I have an Etsy shop I have to keep stocked, so I often crochet all night. Making me feel and look run down. He lavender refreshes my skin and it also helps me stay calm, so I ca go to sleep when I'm done, instead of having to wind down.<br />Keep this in your bag to use throughout the day. Shake well to mix the ingredients. They separate a bit when sitting for a while.. Shaking insures you get the right combination of all of them..  I don’t like saying I LOVE THIS!, because everyone seems to say the same thing. But I can say I LOVE LAVENDER!! And this smells like real fresh lavender when shaken and sprayed.<br />I love the items this company put out so far. I am looking forward to trying more of them.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />My No Nonsense Thoughts:<br /> I could copy the description or retell you that you have already read in the description, But you've already read it. I will try and tell you what I see, Smell, hear, what happens, and my opinion as well as I can. So it's easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you're wanting to give someone. I have money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen's description.<br />As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.<br /> I have no connection to this seller and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I have never been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I'm  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don’t spellcheck or my dyslexia takes over.. But I will do my best to be honest with you.	2015-08-15

Plus, I contacted the seller and they answered my question right away. I think these are good for an intro into using cloth pads (they are the first that I have used).  Wouldn't recommend sleeping in them necessarily, but larger overnight pads may be on the way from the manufacturer to solve this little issue.  So, yay!	2015-08-15

It stings a lot but does a good job removing hair.  The small size gives you good control.  I really love the facial cleansing brush, and a big plus is that you can use it in the tub.

I regret using this &#34;treatment&#34;<br />There is a reason why there is a disclosure stating that their product does not cause broken hair, but rather could be a result from the heat of ironing because they want to blame it on the heat!!!<br /><br />For the record I used the flat iron in medium and passed 2 times which I normally use it on a higher setting but since the product had a burnt smell I was afraid so I decided to use it in medium and pass it only twice as opposed to 3 or 4 times like I normally do.<br />I normally don't write reviews but I don't want anyone else to go thru this with this product. I don't care about the $ but for my hair that now I don't even know if I would have to cut :(<br /><br />Yane<br /><br />If you decide to buy and use this product, remember, you have been warned....I hope someone learns from my mistake.	2015-08-15

It was packaged so well that it probably could have been dropped from the top of a building and been in perfect shape.  It applies so smoothly and the color is very pigmented. It is a powder, and it's literally as smooth as baby powder.  A little goes a long way with this, and did I mention the size?

The Ingenue color is the one a lot of Victoria Secret models wear and I always like how their lips look sorta natural, just enhanced. And that's exactly what it does for me. Plus, it somehow hydrates my lips instead of drying them. You really can't go wrong with these and so far, I haven't found a bad color yet.	2015-08-15

As others have mentioned I too have noticed ...	I know a lot of people have had issues with this new replacement blade... but for me, it seems fine. As others have mentioned I too have noticed that it does seem to pull SLIGHTLY more then my old blades... I usually shave every day and don't notice it. It's fine. However if I skip a day, I notice it. If I skip 2 or more days (which I have not yet) I'm sure I'll really notice it.<br /><br />For those of us who shave every day and don't have THICK hair, this blade works fine. I can see how others with thicker hair have had issues. And as others mentioned they did change the way it works. They do give you the orange blade remover in here, but I don't have a reason to ever remove the blades (and you honestly don't need the tool).<br /><br />People say it's easier to remove the cover now to get to the blades... okay. I find it no different then the old design. Maybe quicker, easier to remove everything since theres no hinge, who knows...<br /><br />Anyway, I gave it 3/5 because it does work fine, however there is a different in blade quality over the other blades. But it's still a fine value.	2015-08-15

I settled on the Super 6 Serum because not only did it contain the vitamin C I was after, it also contained other beneficial ingredients that I hoped would address other skin care concerns I have.<br /><br />I liked that it didn't sting when I applied it.  I liked that even though it is a bright orange color, it didn't stain or color my skin.  I liked that it didn't break me out. I liked that it absorbed quickly and didn't leave my skin feeling sticky.  What I didn't like was that it didn't seem to do much.  I wasn't expecting a miracle:  a little skin brightening, some help fading dark spots, maybe a bit of softening for the fine lines I'm starting to get around my eyes or at least some help preventing new ones.  This product didn't seem to work very well for me in any of those areas.	2015-08-15

I love Panasonic stuff normally, but this isn't about what I love.  It's about what you, the informed consumer, should buy.  So, if I had it to do over again, I'd do more research and get a better model.  It's decent, but just that.  My old rotary Norelcos cut better and shave smoother, and one of those sounds like it's ready to explode.<br /><br />I think this shaver is built well.  Feels solid. This is something I've noticed from Panasonic for many years and one of the reasons I bought it, as they rarely make anything that isn't good.  But when you switch it on, especially after a full charge, it basically sounds like it's running at about a hundred thousand RPM, and gives you sort of a lackluster cut.  Multiple passes over the same area.  Really hard to get a decent shave on the neck.  The flip-out trimmer is also not a very aggressive cutter, but it's fine inasmuch as it won't let you get too out-of-control on your moustache.  Other reviewers have mentioned a &#34;linear motor&#34; available on higher-end models, so they may do a better job.  My experience so far leads me to believe rotaries cut better, or at least faster.	2015-08-15

It was packaged nicely and tightly in a good box (great for gift giving I think) It came with a small instruction 'book', headband, charger, and the cleaning brush itself.<br /><br />A big point in this for me was- Most cleaning brushes that rotate or have that mechanism can not be used with cleansers that have exfoliating beads due to the right of those beads getting into the motor, I don't have to worry about that with this. I think it's also a good option for someone with sensitive skin who may not do well with the regular fiber bristles.<br /><br />I tried it out right away this is what I noticed-<br />The silicone actually gives a great grip even when wet.<br />The \\\"bristles\\\\\" are nice and firm but still flexible to get a nice lather going.<br />The on button is centered and easy to find and push.<br />The adjustable vibration levels are a really great feature for me!<br />The tapered top is great for getting right up on my hairline where I seem to sweat a lot and need that cleaning power.<br /><br />So far it has held a nice charge for me. The fact that it is rechargeable is a huge bonus in my book- not having to deal with it dying and not having spare batteries.<br />It is super easy to clean, super easy to charge.<br /><br />I received this product discounted in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."	2015-08-15

I used it for the first time.  I saw it a while back at CVS and read that it was good for thinning hair. So I was on the fence for a while until I saw that it was on sale. So after using it for the first time and after drying and setting my hair I noticed that my hair's volume was just superfluous. Very noticeable. So perhaps it also works to improve volume for thinning hair. The only other complaint I have is that I may have to use a conditioner after this shampoo the next time as you will need one. It was not easy to comb my hair.<br /><br />I will try to give my updated review in a few weeks.	2015-08-15

My hair is so dry that even with a in shower conditioner and a leave in, it still looks dry and frizzy. Not when I used this in place of my in shower conditioner. I didn't need the leave in. And it stayed silky through another hair washing without even using it again that time. You do want to listen to the instructions and immediately wash hands after applying, took me a few hand washes back to back to get it off. I pinned up my hair for the few minutes it was applied so I didn't dye my neck and back. All in all, I'm very happy with this product.	2015-08-15

This earring organizer is okay, but it is plastic, as it says in the title, and flimsy. The space under the earring holes is not enough, so long dangle earrings will hang below the next organizing space. Droplet earrings and studs do best. I find the product bending under the weight of my earrings. Also, the holes are close together, and you have to put earrings in every other hole.  In short, buy an organizer that is heavier, and has holes that are farther apart.	2015-08-15

I put this on for the first time today, so this review will be of my initial observations. If I observe any results after some longer use then I will update.<br />The consistency of this product is quite watery. Before applying, I shook the container and it was still watery. When I initially put it on my skin it was a bit difficult to spread but did absorb pretty fast. My skin felt pretty rough in the areas I applied, not moisturized at all.

Like most electric/battery powered toothbrushes, it makes a little noise...but then again you have a rotating device inside your mouth so you're going to hear it.  The brush bristles are not to hard and do not hurt my gums.  The rotation of the brush heads don't rattle my teeth or hurt my gums like some other brushes I have tried.  The brush works and cleans well.  The tooth paste...though not my favorite brand...was actually ok.  Since my wife already had a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I shared the other one with my daughter.  It was her first battery powered toothbrush.  Though 40, she acted like a teenager...had loads of fun with it...and in the end...said she really liked the way it cleaned.	2015-08-15

It is NOT a conditioner.  It is suppose to repair fibers.<br />Instructions say to use it on wet hair before shampoo.  It comes out creamy, but once it touches your wet hair, it seems to vanish.  I have no idea if I am getting it on all my hair or not.  Using extra does not make any difference.<br />Leave on for 1-2 minutes and rinse out.  Hair feels no different after rinsing.  Again it is no a conditioner per say....but how are you suppose to know if it is working?<br />If I just used this and got out of the shower, I would not be able to get a comb thru my hair.<br /><br />The Kerastase Resistance shampoo is great...softens and conditons.<br />But I have to say that this product is useless part of the hair care.  You'd be better off getting an after shampoo conditioner or a leave in conditioner.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of one, since I am not 100% sure it is not secretly working to repair my damaged hair.	2015-08-15

US	10942711	R2GXYIKNJFSZRT	B00PFCT2R0	21259241	Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara	Beauty	2	1	1	N	N	Lousy.	This mascara doesn't hold the curl in my lashes at all.  And it doesn't give me much volume either.  Like almost all waterproof formulas, you can't apply more than one thick coat otherwise your lashes will get really clumpy.  But my other waterproof mascara does hold the curl all day so this one was a true disappointment.  The brush doesn't reach every lash and I found myself really struggling to get good coverage.  The color is nice and dark which is the only good thing I can say for it.  Even with a thin coat, there were some clumps and too much mascara builds up on the tip of the wand.  My regular waterproof mascara is The Rocket and although I'm not a fan of the brush, it does build considerable volume without clumps.  It also holds the curl.  This may be a result of the shape of the brush or because it's a totally different formula, I'm not sure which.  I think it's unlikely that Maybelline has numerous waterproof formulas.  It's more like they only have one and simply offer different brush styles.  Whatever the case may be, I get more volume and length with Rocket than with Lash Sensational.  If I can only apply one coat, I want to make sure each and every lash is coated and has maximum volume and length.  I can actually apply two thin coats of Rocket because it seems to take a little longer to dry (which is a good thing).  I use the Diorshow lash primer and then Rocket (Diorshow mascara sucks, btw) and I get full, dark lashes that look like falsies.  My lashes may have thinned with age, but they're still very long so I need volume the most.  Rocket is my go-to product and I'm sorry I wasted my money on Lash Sensational.  I may be looking for a mascara unicorn but there's bound to be a waterproof formula that permits several coats and still holds a curl.  So I'm still searching.  In the meantime, I'm sticking with Rocket because I refuse to spend big money on a product that only lasts three months.  For now, Rocket is the winner.	2015-08-15

This is a good product but doesn't quite fit the description of BIG volume. I have tiny sparse lashes and need something to make them visible.  I was looking for something more dramatic like the L'oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara. What is great about the product is that it does not smear.  I did see a couple of tiny flakes at the end of the day but nothing to complain about. I had previously bought Yves Saint Laurent Volume Effet Faux Cils Luxurious Mascara for a False Lash Effect 1 High Density Black but it would leave smudges within hours--disappointing for $28!  I decided to try this product because of the 2000 plus reviews.  I think I might try L'oreal on one eye and this one on the other to compare and see what they look like at the end of the day.	2015-08-15

Yes yes yes!!!!! Finally a product that's helps my course thick hair!!! I've always been told I have horse hair because of how thick and course it is. It breaks because its so dry even though I've used conditioner as well as oils. I started using arga oil and coconut oil almost a year ago and it didn't help it be more shiney but it didn't help much with the softness. I opened the gorgeous jar smelled it (smells wonderful), felt it thwn read the directions. After the first use my hair smelt amazing but I didn't notice much of  a difference. So I tried it again a couple days later. After the third use (about a week later) my hair was much softer and it seemed to feel hydrated and oh so shiney. I now use it once a week and am amazed at how well this has helped my hair! After spending hundreds of dollars buying salon products that didn't help much this is now my go to hair product! It even helps my curls look more even and not so frizzy. If you have thick course hair you must give this a try!!!! I did receive a discount for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-15

In my opinion, when a person is actually buying your product, you don't get greedy and jack the price up. People were buying from you guys because you were affordable and better than Wen. I've have never tried Wen, but I did purchase this product when it was $9.99. I'm glad I got it then because I'd NEVER pay $17.00 for a conditioner (even if it put sparkles in my hair). I'm a 4c African American chic. This conditioner kept my hair moist all day. It works great. Unfortunately, I don't have $17.00 for one product, so I won't be buying it again :-(. I liked the smell of it. Some people don't. I didn't get product build up and it had a lot of slip. The bottle came filled to the very top. I really liked that because it gave me a true sense of how much I used. I didn't make a dent in the product. With 4c hair, it takes a lot of conditioner/water because our hair tangles from the roots (it sucks a million). I am very pleased with the product but for $17.00, Renpure has gotta be freaking crazy!	2015-08-15

To achieve a great shave, you need a sharp blade. All 5 blades does is spread out the contract area, it does not increase shave quality. One blade that is angled properly, easy to keep dry and replace, and infinitely cheaper will serve you just as well.<br /><br />When you buy those fancy multi blade razors, ask you really get for your money is that fancy snap on ability.<br /><br />As far as two sided, single blade safety razors go, this one is of particularly high value for the money. To a certain extent, any razor of this design with the right angles and ease of use will fit the bill, but shaveology has really stepped it up with extra quality blades, a drying cloth and simple, high quality, travel sheath.<br /><br />At the price I payed, I can't imagine higher value.	2015-08-15

I used to get some freckles every summer, mostly noticeable on my hands, but as I got older they stayed around longer, were bigger, and I think some people call them age spots instead of freckles now (although I don't like to call them that). I bought this anti aging serum hoping to lighten those spots. I took a photo of my hand after applying the serum a couple of times and then again a few days later. The spots are definitely lighter than before I started applying the serum but in the photos I cannot see a lot of difference.  There were no instructions included in the packaging or on the bottle about applying the serum but I remembered that on the listing it was called facial serum and that it was supposed to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  I decided to see how the serum worked on the lines around my mouth. So this morning after washing my face I took a photo and then after applying the serum I took another photo a few minutes later. This time I not only saw my lines and wrinkles smoothing out, it shows in the photos.  I don't know if this is just a temporary reduction in the appearance of the lines and wrinkles or if I continue to use the serum it will make my skin look younger but I really like what it's doing so far.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review but I like the results I'm getting and will continue to use the product.	2015-08-15

Every been so mad, you had to laugh? Well that's me right now. I ordered milky Remy saga 12 inch 1b. What I got was some cheap knockoff 8 in hair. They even had the balls to put it in a bag labeled 12in as of I would be dumb enough to.believe that was the correct size. I typically buy this brand in store but thought I would give it a chance online via Amazon because I have never had an issue with any items via Amazon. NEVER AGAIN! Further, I know exactly what the advertised hair looks and feel likes, so for a company to be blatantly deceptive, makes me mad as he**! I always look at reviews and saw so many positive ones (including pics), plus it's amazon, so I felt comfortable with the purchase. Lesson freaking learned. My only bright side to this is that I only bought one option (I saved a lot of their options) just to give a test try. I'm glad I went with my gut and did that because I would have been out of a lot more money if I bought all I saw on the page. I promise to all shoppers that I am not a bitter customer trying to retatilate. I am a honest customer that is completely stunned that this company flat out LIED about the product they advertised!!! I would give this zero stars if I could.	2015-08-15

I use it for my hair as a leave in conditioner with the Argan oil(i mix Argan,Jojoba,Coconut and Black Jamaican Castor Oil).I noticed a huge difference.But my review is not about my hair. I stopped going to a nail salon for my pedicure and manicure after i noticed that every time i would go(even different ones)i would get nail fungus.I know that it takes many months to treat your nail.For a dermatologist appointment i have to wait 4 months.I tryed many brands from the store and nothing was working for me.The only product that was better was Focalex,a product that i could buy it from Germany,a hassle to get it.And my toe nail was better,not completely healed. One day i mixed jojoba oil,coconut oil,few drops of tea tree oil and levander oil,to use it for my skin and my back acne.I didn't liked the smell at all,i wanted to use all of the mixed oils so i applied what was left on my toe nails.Next day i noticed the nail fungus was gone.Completelly gone!!I couldn't believe it.I am really curious if any of the reviewers have tryed the Jojoba oil for their nail fungus.If yes please reply. I am thinking to use the same for my husband.He is wearing boots in the summer because of his work,and he is very sensitive to oils,he might be allergic to one,so i will wait to consult his doctor.	2015-08-15

Great Deal!	I am a huge fan of cleansing facial brushes.  Washing with your hands or a washcloth just cannot compete with the cleansing and exfoliating ability of a facial brush. The gentle bristles exfoliate dead skin and reduces blackheads, deep cleanse pores, and remove makeup, sweat, oil, and dirt.  If you haven't used a facial cleansing brush before, trust me when I say that once you cleanse with a brush, you will never want to go back to washing with your hands or with a wash cloth.<br /><br />A Clairsonic facial brush will run you around $100, and a Clinque facial brush around $90. Luckily, HaloSpa offers this awesome 4-in-1 cleaning brush for a fraction of the cost of one of those name brand brushes.<br /><br />The HaloSpa cleansing brush is cordless and runs on 4 AA batteries. It is water-resistant and safe to use in the shower - just don't submerge it in water.<br /><br />HaloSpa's cleansing brush comes with 4 attachments:<br />an exfoliating facial cleansing brush for deep cleansing and exfoliating your face<br />a large body brush for exfoliating dead skin and deep cleansing your body<br />a facial sponge for cleansing sensitive skin or for applying serum or moisturizer<br />and a pumice stone for buffing away calluses and dead skin<br /><br />I use the facial cleansing brush for washing my face in the am and pm daily. My skin feels so fresh and clean after cleansing - I love it. I use the body brush bi-weekly to exfoliate my entire body in the shower. After the shower I drench my body in lotion and my skin is oh-so-soft. Love it. I have also found that the body brush is great for exfoliating my legs and underarms before I shave. It helps me get a nice, close shave and leaves my skin feeling extra smooth. Also, I tend to get ingrown hairs and exfoliating with the brush prior to shaving helps to keep them astray.<br /><br />So, for about a quarter of the price of one of the name brand facial brushes you can purchase a cleansing brush that serves 4 purposes. The HaloSpa Advanced Cleansing Facial Brush and Micro-Exfoliating System is truly a great deal and I would absolutely recommend it.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product.

Beauty	5	7	8	N	N	This is everything that tweezers can and should be! High quality, beautiful and exceptionally well designed.	Okay, now I feel bad: before this week I had pretty much taken tweezers for granted. Tweezers were just .. well, tweezers. To me, tweezers just had a purpose and they either served that purpose well or they didn’t. Recently I was given the opportunity to receive these Care Excellency tweezers in exchange for evaluation and a review and guess what I learned? That HOLY HECK TWEEZERS CAN BE AWESOME! I was expecting tweezers: what I received were the Taj Mahal with a Porshe on top wrapped up in MagicOreosWithNoCalories of TWEEZERS. First, these Tweezers (they deserve the first letter to be capitalized: it differentiates them from tweezer mutts) come in a beautiful pink zippered case. This case seriously rocks: beautiful color, strong zipper, quality made case (I’ve had purses that aren’t made this well). Nestled inside of the wonderful case are Tweezers that set a new standard for what tweezers should be. A ton of R&D must have gone into the design: perfectly weighted, perfectly sized and perfectly shaped for precision use. The tips are excellent - precision-aligned, no splinter or stray hair is too small to be firmly grasped and there is zero sliding once grasped. I love the quality and the attention to detail that went into these: from the German Stainless Steel to the amazing ergonomic design, every detail is spot on. My eyebrows have never had it so good. These Tweezers look amazing and work beautifully!	2015-08-15

I have had adult acne for about 15+ years now that had only improved slightly based on various products I have tried. I have spent so much money on expensive products to no avail, and I have tried so many different things. I have been using nixoderm for approximately three weeks now and I am astonished with the results. I started using it in the midst of a really horrible breakout and it didn't so much help clear it up because the damage was already done,  but it really helped with the marks that remain afterward. I have still had some small pimples but they come to a head quickly and go away quickly. I'm a picker so the fact that they come  to a head makes it easier to leave them alone once I can pop them. My pimples didn't come to a head before.  I use it only at night because it's a thick paste and just wouldn't work for daytime. It says to cut it with Vaseline if you have sensitive skin but I usually put on my night time moisturizer first and then blend someone nixoderm on top. I go a little heavier if i see there might be a pimple emerging. It does have a burning sensation but it subsides after about 10 minutes. It  causes something peeling, which I thought might just be from the glycolic acid peel I still use for dark spots , but a friend of mine tried nixoderm and says that she started peeling after a few days as well. I found an info sheet online that says use for 7 or 10 days then stop for 3. I have done so and I imagine it's just to give your skin a rest due to the exfoliating effect. I survived pms with no breakout whatsoever. The end result is my skin hasn't looked this amazing in years. I think it is even helping to fade my dark spots as well. I don't have a before picture to take, but I can tell you at any given time I would have 5-6 pimples that would stick around for at least a week at any given time. Highly highly recommend!!	2015-08-15

Both were bundled together and tightly wrapped in plastic. I could see there was powder under the plastic and of course it went everywhere as I freed them from captivity. One is fine; the &#34;evil twin&#34; still contains a great deal of powder as judged by weight, and I'd hoped to be able to transfer it to a different container, but alas, the mechanics of the twist open cap defy known laws of physics. It will not close completely (nor open further), which is obviously the cause of the original powder disaster, but neither will the cap concede to my masterful attempts at forcible removal. I can't bear to throw away good powder, but as it refuses to be shaken out in a useable manner, it is not really worth keeping. It also seems ridiculous to go to the trouble to send back so that another innocent person can be covered in powder.  So, you see I have a true dilemma. The other one works beautifully, and is delightfully powdery, which is great, since I essentially paid double for it.	2015-08-15

I emailed Maple Holistics and asked for a free sample of this product. That is a plus in my book when a company will let you try their product before you buy it. I've been using the free sample (which was a generous amount) for a few days now. I have to say I like it a lot. It really does work well on my dandruff, the only thing I don't like about this shampoo is that it leaves my hair a little dry and causes some tangles. But I expect the dray part since most dandruff shampoos do dry out your hair. But all in all it works really well and will be buying another bottle once the free sample runs out.	2015-08-15

Some of them are great and others are not. Some of them last for a up to 2-3 weeks while a lot of only lasted a couple days. I am happy to say these tattoos go into the good pile. My sister and I love metallic tattoos, so we both tried them out, and we both love them. They are easy to put on, and they lasted our entire two week vacation at out summer home. When we got home, we did have to take them off for work, and they came off easy as well. What we did was rub in some baby-oil and let it soak in and then hopped into the shower and scrub it off. It doesn't take a lot of scrubbing; the oil and the steam from the shower do the work for you.<br /><br />The quality of the tattoos were great, and the quantity was good. There were two sheets and each sheet had about a dozen tattoos, and there were a variety of designs. My sister loved all the arrows while I favored the birds. We were both happy with the selection and did not feel limited in our choices. These are great for vacation time especially when you do not want to bring jewelry with you. They lasted a long time even through sweaty days, swimming (in fresh water,) the sand, and showering (without baby-oil.) They are just fun things to have, and we did have a blast using them and got more than a few compliments while wearing them. I would definitely buy these again next summer.<br /><br />Overall, we both recommend this product.	2015-08-15

The formula I got was way too wet and clumped my lashes like crazy. It doesn't make my lashes look terrible but it takes forever to dry and that's a real problem because when applying a coat to my bottom lashes I often times look down and that caused all of my top lashes to clump and leave goopy streaks of wet mascara on my lids. Wouldn't reccomend.	2015-08-15

This rest solves the gel rest problem. I like the gel rests the best because they are the most comfortable and durable. I can sanitize them better than any other rests I've used. The problems I've had with most of the gel neck rests, is they are only good until they get wet, then they slip off. I've tried the gel rests with the built in suction cups before. They are better than the ones without, but they eventually give way when wet as well. The major pro with this item is the suction cups are made of material that are not gel. They adhere terrifically. They are built around the gel and attached that way. I'm assuming one would want to keep that area dry in between uses so it doesn't eventually break down there.<br />The only problem I have is the single cup does not reach to the outside under the sink. Not sure if my sink has too thick of a rest? Either way, it is not made for universal use. Nevertheless, it still stays on, the single one just stays un attached. It does get caught on the chair sometimes if I am not careful when I bring the client up from the bowl. If this company would make this rest a little longer in the single cup area, it would fit most sinks, and I would sing their praises and look for a way to rate it with 10 stars!	2015-08-15

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	Leaves my skin silky soft with a pleasant scent!!	First of all, the scent of this product is wonderful! I believe is one of the ingredients: Peppermint Oil, It's best, refreshing scent ever!<br />It was shipped promptly and protected. I love this moisturizer from the second I started using it.This is a non-greasy moisturizer that goes on smoothly,doesn't take much, and makes your face and neck (even my hands!!) feel refreshed and amazing, so soft!!. It absorbs quickly and does not leave any greasy residue. After cleanse your face or the part of your body you want to treat and applying this great moisturizer you are left with a nice refreshed feeling. So far, it has really gave my face a nice beautiful glowing and healthy look to it which I like a lot.<br />I received this item at a discount, in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

Packaged in a generous 1.7 ounce glass jar. Creme is the normal moderately thick white cream. I can't detect any strong smell, just a very faint fresh clean smell that doesn't linger long.<br /><br />This is a great sunscreen for sensitive skin. A lot of sunscreen products irritate my skin or burn a little bit especially when sweating, this one hasn't so far and I tried it for 4 days now and sweated with it on pretty heavy. It doesn't leave a thick mask like feeling like some other sunscreens I have tried, make up goes on easily right over it. Leaves my skin soft, smooth, very hydrated and fresh looking. So far I have no clogged pores which a lot of sunscreens do to my skin. It absorbs quickly, leaves no oily residue or sticky feeling. One more thing that is my pet peeve of sunscreens, if I sweat while wearing them and the sweat gets in my eyes it burns like crazy, and this one doesn't burn if I get sweat i my eyes either. Just this has sold me on this as sweating outside and burning my eyes, it is really hard to find a product that doesn't do that to me.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

I love tarte brushes and this one hasn't dissapointed me yet. I have been using it to apply my setting powder, and I really like the results.

I wish this product, or any Dove product, worked out for me because they have some really dreamy scents!<br /><br />After the first wash, everything was fine. I wash my hair everyday, so the second day I started to feel my hair less clean and more stiff. On the third day, my hair looked greasy. On the fourth day, my hair looked greasy and I could barely get a comb through it.<br /><br />This was experimented on my hair on days where no other products were used in my hair. This leads me to believe that this shampoo and conditioner duo, like all Dove shampoos and conditioners do to me, left product build up within my tresses.<br /><br />Not a good look, but to each their own. I personally like the results of a clarifying shampoo and a heavy conditioner combo of Garnier and Herbal Essence. Works wonders for me, but definitely not Dove.	2015-08-15

Another note, I would use this for cooler weather rather than hot weather as although it does feel sticky and clammy when you first wear it.

For anyone who has read my reviews you know that I am a natural health consultant, but I am also a huge fan of Majestic Pure.

He slept through the night, which is rare for him, and he wasn't as groggy in the morning. I did notice that the oil has a slight soap scent with it, but this doesn't detract from the lavender or how it works.<br /><br />This is, like most of Majestic Pure's line, a therapeutic grade so it can be used in a variety of health and diy applications.	2015-08-15

My first impression was that the scent is a little strong. It has a soapy-clean sort of fragrance that I was initially not certain I would like.

Now, I like how easily this applies for a solid and I also like how it does not creep through my black t-shirts (but it will still leave white marks inside, of course). Finally, it is entirely effective as both a deodorant and an antiperspirant.<br /><br />Dove deodorants are gentle on my sensitive skin and always perform well. It is a product I trust and use!

This replaced my older replacement head to my Arcitec since Norelco discontinued it.

My shave is as close as I remember it being over three decades ago and my shaving time is cut in half compared to the previous head. I would rate this 4 1/2 Stars if I could.

My kids and even the hubby hates to have hair all over them after a hair cut.  The broom never seems to pick all the hair up and we still seem to find hair days later.  I have always wanted to try a haircut cape to see if it would control the mess and I was so happy that it did.  And Guess What???  Guys can use it when shaving their beards also, or if you trim their beards for them!  I opened the package and it popped open for me, so quick and easy.  My hubby wanted to try it first because he shaves every week and my bathroom always looks like a disaster afterwards.  I placed the cape over his head and then velcroed the back securely.  He shaved, un-velcroed the cape, slid the cape up and dumped all the hair in the trash.  He went to the bath tub and just let the water rinse the leftover hair off.  We hung up on the counter to let it air dry before folding up again.  He was so happy that he didnt have to change clothes or sweep because they cape caught all the hair.  Cant wait to try it on my little mans hair when it gets long again.  He is going to love not being covered in hair.<br /><br />*I recieved this Haircut Cape for Kids for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review	2015-08-15

I'm kind of a newbie when it comes to essential oils, but my lady and all our friends are seriously into them and, intentionally or not, they've dragged me into it too. And I kind of like it, if truth be told. I feel a proper witch, brewing and blending, devising the proper blends to cure this or that ailment. So I've been trying to build up a small collection of essential oils and essential oil blends in order to get ideas for myself on new things to try. This, however, is the very first cream I saw infused with essential oils, but since I am very familiar with Plant Therapy brand products, I had every confidence that they would deliver a quality product and so I went ahead and ordered.<br /><br />I really enjoy this. Now, the listing says &#34;aromatherapy&#34; but I'm a dude who can't smell for beans. No sense of smell unless it's a steam-roller in-your-face Hulk-strong scent. So I never quite know if I am able to benefit fully from these types of things. But whoa-oh-oh! I used this and, sense of smell or not, I was awake! My skin felt tingly and alive. I felt quite energised and refreshed (and the lady said I smelled divine). It comes in a nice bottle, professional and comprehensive labeling. There's no messy residue from applying thecream and it absorbs pretty quickly. Overall, I'm so very glad I tried this!<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for a genuine critique.	2015-08-15

If you are going to use the gym/pool shower, it is a hassle to carry multiple bottles.<br /><br />The bottle itself is big and contains 22 oz of product whereas standard size bottles contain only 14 oz. It makes sense for this product to be big because you use much more of the stuff per shower.<br /><br />I am satisfied with this product. It lathers well and smells nice, excellent for use after exercise. The shampoo and body wash aspect of it works very well, but the conditioner is not the same as traditional oil-based conditioners. I am accustomed to conditioners that use oils to make my hair smoother and easy to comb, but this conditioner doesn't seem to have that effect. I was expecting this, since most shampoo+conditioner combinations don't feel the same as traditional conditioners. If you have very dry or brittle hair, you may need to use a dedicated conditioner in addition to this product. Overall though, it is a great 3-in-1 product for the average person.	2015-08-15

If I use a product that my skin does not like, it becomes noticeable almost immediately.  I tried these sponges and I was super impressed by 1) the size of the sponge, nice wide sponge 2) the texture of it,  is amazing!! nice and smooth and soft and 3) how safe it was for my face.  Not one single sign of a rash from using this sponge.  I use it with my daily facial cleanser cream.  Lather it on and scrub away softly with these awesome sponges.  I need to order a few more for my kids to try.	2015-08-15

I have tried lots of similar serums	This is a nice serum. I have tried lots of similar serums, well this one will be in my top 10 choices if you were looking for vitamin serums. This one is based on hyaluronic acid that is full of great qualities for skin. I like that this serum has anti-aging properties. I love the packaging - it will be great for a gift for someone you appreciate. I love the scent - very cirtusy and mild, not too strong, but at the same time very refreshing. I like the consistency. This serum is a bit whiter than I see usual creams with hyaluronic acid. I like that. The texture is great, not too liquid, easy to apply on the skin. I also like how fast it absorbs in the skin - there is no residue from this serum after you apply it. My skin doesn't tug anywhere, it is not making my face tight at all. Easy to apply under your makeup as it immediately dries, and no need to wait for half an hour before putting on the next layer of your makeup and skincare routine. What a great product! I have received this product for free for a review.	2015-08-15

I am natural 4c- extremely dry, kinky and fragile.  I purchased this product from my local Sally’s.  Thankfully the sales clerk was very good and encouraged me to take advantage of the sale.  This product normally sells for round 9 regular price.  I think I got maybe 4 boxes for less than 20 during the sale.  I choose to write a review on Amazon because I do enjoy shopping the site and I really depend on reviews when making purchases here or elsewhere.<br /><br />I have been natural since 2008.  After many years of frustration with breakage and difficult to manage hair, I returned to relaxer around April 2011. After on application my hair literally fell out!  By June of 2011 I was down to hair that barely covered my scalp.  Starting over natural I struggled with the same frustrations as before. Since relaxers were no longer an option I resigned to wearing wigs and just focus on keeping my hair healthy and clean.  I've now been using 619 for at least 4 months. I noticed a difference in the state of my hair after the first use. It was noticeably softer and more manageable.  After 4 months my hair is stronger, way less breakage, moist, maintaining length, and is way softer than it has ever been! Even my hair coils also seem to be more relaxed and not as tight.  It seems that the stronger my hair gets, the less it coils.  I do not have nearly as much shrinkage after shampooing. Because it has been difficult to restore moisture after shampooing, I try to go at least 2 weeks before shampooing.  This not so much an issue with 619; however, I do not care to shampoo too often. I did not want to wait 2 weeks between 619 treatments. I apply it to my hair a couple times a week.  Since my hair is short, I do not need to use a full bottle.  I pour 619 into a small spray bottle. This is a great way to store leftover and makes it much easier to apply evenly.<br /><br />Although this product is a bit expensive, it is worth the money! I would encourage you to check out Sally’s and try to catch it on sale.ncourage you to check out Sally’s and try to catch it on sale.	2015-08-15

It leaves my skin soft and I hardly have any hang nails. Also, it seems to keep the cuticle grown to a minimum. When I use a cuticle remover, it seems like there is less to remove. As another reviewer mentioned, even if I miss using the oil for a day, my skin is still hydrated and looks great. It's difficult to say if it has helped the strength of my nails as I use shellac. However, since using this cuticle & nail oil, it does seem like my nails have less damage when shellac is removed. The scent is also very pleasing. It's very subtle but nice. I will definitely buy the larger refill bottle when I run out. :)	2015-08-15

Anyway, they work, but you can go through a lot of them when it isn't necessary if you just purchase the Extreme Course in the first place.

In all cases I have found that the electric shavers and their blades do an okay job of cutting facial hair. It's not as close as a blade, but &#34;close enough&#34; so your face looks smooth. These Braun replacement blades/screen last about a year. Cleaning the shaver in the cleaning solution prolongs the screen and the blade's life. The solution, however, is expensive. The newer electric shavers can be rinsed clean just using tap water, and they shave is just as close as the Braun. I have since moved on from the Braun because of the expense of cleaning solution (which is nothing more than rubbing alcohol and a tiny bit of mineral oil and a couple of drops of lemon extract). One star deducted because of the price of the cleaning solution.	2015-08-15

I am a fan of essential oils and i really like lemon oil for cleaning my house as i have children and don't like exposing them to chemicals. I have a 32 oz spray bottle and i mix about 80 drops of lemon oil and about 40 drops of tea tree oil and distilled water.  I just spray on my counters to clean them.  You can pretty much use it anywhere; toilet seats, laundry for a fresh scent.<br />  Another use that I always talk to my friends about is using it for bad breath and to whiten teeth a bit.  I'm a dental hygienist and i will mix a few drops with a little baking soda and coconut oil and apply it to my teeth, after brushing, and let it sit for a while and it helps whiten my teeth a bit as i love coffee but i don't love that coffee stains my teeth.<br />  This particular brand, morning pep, i had never heard of until recently and I had been ordering from the popular brands that cost and arm and a leg.  This works just as well, has a great scent and it isn't diluted and there are no additives or chemicals that i don't want. The seller even wrapped the bottle really well in bubble wrap to prevent any leakage or breaking of the bottle. I did receive a discount to test it out and this is my opinion of this lemon oil that is not at all swayed by the fact i bought this at a discount.  Overall,  I'm pleased with morning pep's lemon oil and it works just as well as the popular brands but doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  I have been paying way too much for years and am pleased that i can order this here on amazon and get a quality oil that doesn't kill my wallet. I would recommend this.	2015-08-15

Beauty	5	1	1	N	N	Just as good or better as the high-end brand facial cleansing oils	I have a few cleansers I like using, and this is one of them. Tatcha which is high-end skincare and has a price to match it, has their version of this and I tried that first and liked it very much...then saw this one at less cost, and since I now have tried both, I see no difference in them other than price.  It has the same 'oil' application that when wet turns milky white and cleanses off dewy and not oily.  It goes a long way too. I like the application pump as well.  Nothing bad to say about it. Very good product. I also have to say that each time I check a price of skincare products at Amazon against the price I paid on QVC, I am saving money on Amazon. This product I got several times on QVC at a cost of $10 more when you factor in their shipping and tax.  Buy it here.  I also saved about $20 buying Dr. Perricone's MD PhotoPlasma SPF moisturizer, another great product, on Amazon over QVC's price.  This is a lesson learned.	2015-08-15

I used it for two weeks and stopped immediately.  My teeth became sensitive (never an issue before), they feel weak and &#34;achy&#34;, and I swear they are MORE yellow than when I started.  I am convinced this toothpaste quickly began to erode the enamel on my teeth.  I am going to speak to my dentist to ask whether I've done permanent damage to my teeth, and frankly, I dread the answer.  I so sincerely regret this purchase.  I have been a life-long &#34;Regular&#34; Colgate Paste user, and I am so sorry for being tempted to try this product.  Now that I have read the other reviews, I am even more convinced that &#34;Optic White&#34; is the cause of the problems I am now experiencing.	2015-08-15

Hair feels like good quality, very soft and silky. It did have a little bit smell when I first got it but faded away very quickly after one washing. The smell isn't something I would worry too much about because it is easily taken care off. I only installed one weave to add thickness to my naturally thin hair. The hair blended right in and was undistinguishable from my hair. The softness and how well it fit in with my hair really made this product great.	2015-08-15

Waxing was a hassle as it took too much work was messy and i had to wait a while for the hair to grow back. But with this epilator you can epilate even fine short hair. I dont recommend this for bikini area though as it hurts really bad. It worked especially great for underarms. Also it pulls out 80% of the hair but cuts off the remainder instead of pulling. I end up with at least one razor bump every time i use this but considering my past experiences i must say this has been the best of all. Worth the purchase!	2015-08-15

I liked this when I first dried and flat ironed it in, but after the treatment, upon washing the 2nd day, while drying hair, it started vreaking off in chunks in my brush!! I was horrified!  My hair is medium fine, but i have used other straighteners over the years, like keratin smoothering ones, professional treatments which worked fine. This is the worst breakage and experience with a smoothing treatment or even a perm that I have EVER had. This product should be off the market in my opinion. I have a prof cosmotology license and i assumed since it was only a 7 day treatment it couldn't be too strong .... Well BUYER BEWARE! Now i have to wait a year for my long previously good conditioned silky hair to all grow back.  I contacted the company for a refund and got no response-	2015-08-15

Like other reviews, initially when you apply it on your face, it does give you a grayish tint. But, once you wait a bit after application it will brighten your skin and match your skin tone.  Even my husband and my 7 year old daughter complimented my skin after my first application.  They both said the BB cream even out my skin tone and covered up my dark spots.  It is my first time trying this brand of BB cream, so I am REALLY SATISFIED with the results!  Definitely will reorder this again, once I run out.	2015-08-15

I love it!<br />Thankfully, I was blessed by God and my parents with lucious lashes of my own, but they aren't really dark... at all.<br /><br />This mascara gives me the best look that I've come across when it comes to mascaras. I've tried pretty much all of the drugstore brands and nothing comes close to this.<br /><br />It goes on easy and the brush really separates my lashes so I don't have to sit there and pay so much attention to detail.<br /><br />It also doesn't remove easy for me, which I like. I cry, it doesn't budge. I go swimming, it doesn't budge. I sleep, it only slightly budges, but it's not good to sleep with makeup on anyway.<br /><br />I love that I can apply 1 coat for an everyday look, and 2 coats for a more dramatic look. The photos show only 1 coat.<br /><br />It does respond well to makeup remover wipes. Only then, depending on if you're using a quality brand, does the mascara remove with ease.<br /><br />I simply adore the effects and will continue to purchase.	2015-08-15

It's smaller than the regular (pink) beauty blender and flakes black spongey particles every so often. It doesnt seem to have the same denseness as the regular bb either, as when I squeeze it after it's wet, it feels like it collapses too easily. With a regular bb there is a small bit of resistance and it's difficult to measure this sort of complaint, but they don't seem be the same despite how they're supposed to only be dissimilar in color.<br /><br />Perhaps I got a faulty product, though next time I think I'd rather buy the the regular pink blender.	2015-08-15

But when I recieved my new Series 9 ..."	I have been using my new razor for a week and a half now and here is what I think about the newest in BrAun's product line, the Series 9 9090cc. I have used regular straight edge razors, (cheaper ones and the more expensive kind) and several different electric razors in my life. My &#34;newest&#34; one was a BrAun series 1 which I have used for years and loved. But when I recieved my new Series 9 9090cc I could not wait to try it out. Unfortunately I had to wait since I had just shaved prior to recieving the package, aghh! The series 9 gives me a perfect, tight shave. It gets all of my facial hairs, no matter what direction they are growing in or what lenght they are. Those are issues I have always had with other electrics, not  with the series  9. I do not get finger numbness from prolonged use and vibration, since I can shave much quicker now than before, and the vibration of the shaver is incredibly much more subtle, more like a massage. Three different, wide shave heads get all types of hair in one or two passes, and they move independently to the contours of your face . The battery charges in about an hour,has a niffty LED display to show me it's charge and you can  charge it in an emergency in only five minutes, though I have not have had to do this yet even after a week of use. It comes with a carrying pouch and a cleaning brush that you will probably never ever need to use, since it includes a cleaning station that cleans and sanitizes the razor thoroughly after every use, and it also dries the blades with a built in fan. The trimmer works great, and I especially like it's new back facing mount, which makes it easier to get those pesky sideburns and mustaches into proper  shape. It has a special power lock function which keeps it from being turned on by accidentally pushing the power button, which is great for when you travel. I even love it's chrome and satin black look, it' like it was made for the terminator :) . I can Honestly say, just as about any other guy out there who has to shave constantly, that I have never looked forward to the daily grind of having to shave. Until now. This is hands down, the best shaving experience I have ever had, period. In my opinion, there are only three  &#34;downsides&#34; to this shaver. I find that many times as I shave, I inadvertently flip up the swivel head button because of it's placement. Also the cleaning solution is not exactly inexpensive and you will need to replace it about every eight weeks. Finally, it's about a $300 investment, that will hopefully will come down with time.<br />To sum it all up: Pros== EVERYTHING, close shave, fast, beautiful, cleaning station, multiple wide heads, long battery life, battery power indicator, power lock travel function.  Cons- in reality, just the price tag about $300, and you will have to spend a little for the comfort of always having a fresh, clean shave using the cleaning solution, not a bad trade I believe.<br />Finally I want to say that even though I have recieved the product as a special promotion from Braun, my review has been as thorough and honest as I could have possibly have made it.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />After having used the shaver for almost three weeks now, I still have to say that is hands down the best electric shaver I have ever used. It cleans itself, four different shaver heads get to all my facial hairs, it's so fast that it's like getting a mini massage as you shave, it's ergonomic and overall a beautiful product. The only cons to this product that I have been able to ascertain: it's not cheap, at over $300, but this is a treat for your face, so not necessarily a con if you hate shaving; you will have to spend some money periodically to replace the cleaning cartridges, but again, the flip side is using a newly cleaned shaver every time. The biggest drawback for me, is the multi-head lock switch and pivoting head: the switch is placed exactly where I place my thumb while shaving, so I have to be extra careful not to push on it while shaving or I inadvertently release the head. Also the head of the shaver, I find if I press just a little too much and not even that strongly, it releases from the lock and pivots by itself as I shave. This last point might be the big issue for me. Will the head assembly eventually fail because it can't remain easily locked while shaving? That is the big question, and considering what you will have to pay for this product, it is THE big question in my mind. I give it a 4.5 out of 5 just because of the shaver head locking issue and nothing else. Overall still love this shavershaving or I inadvertently release the head.

These are the next best thing save for Restasis, which is by prescription only, and if you are on Medicare, your copay for a three months supply comes to $370.00.  Compared to that cost, Hylo-Forte is a true bargain, and it does the same as Restasis.  I happen to have chronic dry eye syndrome, and Hylo-Forte works fine for me.  I apply it in the morning and at bed time.  Very seldom do I need to reapply in between.  The application just takes a little practice.  You may spill a few drops in the beginning.  I highly recommend it for anybody with dry eyes.	2015-08-15

I haven't really noticed a difference in my pores at all, probably because they are massive, but I still use this after cleaning my face before bed, and sometimes in the mornings if my skin feels a little dry. It perfectly moisturizes and my skin has been looking a lot nicer lately. The only thing that bothered me initially was the pump. You'll probably see a lot of other reviews saying the pump is terrible, and it is. I got around this by just unscrewing the top and dabbing the product onto my finger off of the pump straw. You are able to get the perfect amount you need every time.	2015-08-15

I would wash with the anti fungal tee tree oil soap twice a day and then completely dry the area with a blow dryer (much to my GF's amusement)  and then apply the the Aloe Vesta Antifungal ointment .

It is a step below Sonicare, but also far more affordable the the premier electric brushes. Spinbrush is battery-powered (included and installed) and offer above-average cleaning capability at the touch of a button. What's missing relative to the higher end alternatives is a timer. You can brush for 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or 10 and never know. Until you press off, it will continue running. The timed brush feature is standard fare for Oral B and Sonicare's electric line. This kit comes with two powered two brushes each with a replacement brush head. There's also a 4.3 oz Arm & Hammer toothpaste, though it doesn't matter much what toothpaste is used unless you have particular dental issues (sensitive gums, enamel decay, etc.). The brush head consists of a a spinning spherical brush on top and an oblong bottom that goes back and forth. This is excellent for removing plaque and getting a deeper clean than a manual brush could offer. One concern that may affect some users is that the motor on this brush is very loud, making it difficult to brush and watch TV at the same time. It's loud enough that it might wake up your spouse if they're still asleep while you're brushing. It would also be nice to have a cap to cover the brush head when not in use. Despite this, Arm & Hammer's Spinbrush offers practical way to improve your dental hygiene. 4/5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of 10/14/15, my wife's Spinbrush stopped working abruptly. Mine is still working, but the battery is only half as powerful as it originally was. This powered toothbrush is not a long-term solution. It will last about 6-8 weeks with regular usage. For those who want a long-term solution, invest upmarket to Sonicare or Oral B's more robust electric toothbrush options.	2015-08-15

This is the third time I've ordered Solkare and would not spend a summer in Southern California without it.  I am reasonable fair and have to work on a tan all year to keep from burning with just normal exposure out of doors.  Once I discovered Solkare I know I am protected from that hour or two out in the yard or garden without being covered in sunscreen.  The other day I took my two Grandsons to the beach and tide pools, I did put on sunscreen just as an extra precaution because I knew I was going to be in the sun all day.  Not the slightest burn or redness, a first for me and a testement to the quality and power of Solkare.	2015-08-15

I've had several pre-cancerous moles removed so I'm careful to stay out of the sun but I still like to look normal aka not blinding white. My friends noticed after I started using this product that I looked tanner but they said it looked very natural and a few of them went out and bought it for themselves. The first time I applied this I used my hands and it was streaky and left my hands stained. Ever since then I have applied it with a tanning mitt and it has been perfect. I usually exfoliate once a week (with scrub AND an abrasive glove) especially on my ankles and knees, no lotion, then apply this when my skin is dry. I do another layer every few days until I can tell it's starting to get blotchy in some areas and then I start over with exfoliating.<br /><br />For my purposes of looking natural and not like a bronzed goddess this method has worked well for me and it's become my favorite tanner. If you sweat a lot or shave every day obviously it's going to come off sooner because you're exfoliating the skin it has affected. And while it &#34;dries&#34; in 60 seconds you have to use your own common sense and know that it takes a few hours to really &#34;set in&#34; and going out to play tennis or anything where you sweat a lot right after you use tanner is a bad idea.	2015-08-15

It gives me additional volume and fattens my lashes nicely.  Be sure and wait until it's dry before applying regular black mascara.  I use a regular mascara for the first coat and a waterproof formula for the last coat (to ensure my lashes hold the curl).  This method works really well for me.  I'm not sure that this primer works better than drugstore primers, because I haven't tried any of the drugstore brands, but I do know that my lashes look fuller and thicker when I use the Dior product.  Some people have suggested that this primer is simply a white mascara but if you look closely, there are little fibers in it that enable it to add dimension and heft to the lashes.  I'm not sure I would repurchase this product though.  Although I haven't tried it, it's possible that I would get the same false lash effect with a few more coats of regular black mascara.  I guess I can try this on one eye to see whether it makes a difference.  However, I do know that I like the way my lashes look when I use this primer.  Who knows?, it may grow on me.  I do recommend it if you have thin sparse lashes.  It definitely adds weight and volume for a fuller, thicker look.  And my lashes stay nice and soft to boot.	2015-08-15

It's exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Because of previous purchases from different companies, I was hesitant to buy these brushes especially because they were so cheap.

I had seen this at sephora and the staff there gave it rave reviews. I was able to purchase the algenist complete eye renewal cream at a reduced price for an unbiased and honest review through the seller. I am a mother of four, work full time, and go to school full time so my eyes tend to have dark circles around them. I have tried covering them with makeup with no success. This cream has made my dark circles fade dramatically and I have noticed the skin around my eyes is smoother and not so loose. The only thing I don't like about this product is the smell. It has alguronic acid which is what makes this product truly work. My facial lotion masks the smell of the eye balm, and I will definitely continue to use this product long term.	2015-08-15

I started using it and had some results of my own. My skin overall is pretty good but my pores around and on my nose were pretty visible. After a couple months of use, I can say I've seen a noticeable decrease in the size of my pores; almost invisible around my nose and working its way up to the top. My daughters acne scars on her forehead have flattened and visibly less noticeable. I don't use this everyday because for my normal/dry skin it's slightly drying. When I use it, it's either for the morning or the night never both. I will definitely recommend this as a great bar cleanser/skin toner.	2015-08-15

I was a bit skeptical at first because I have never been a fan of gel deodorants. However, after using it for a few weeks now I am pretty happy with the performance of this product. I tend to sweat a lot in the summer heat and this deodorant keeps me sweat free for several hours. I love the scent too. It has a light refreshing scent that you can smell hours after applying it. But the best part is that because it is a clear gel it leaves absolutely no residue on my clothes! Normally when I've used gels in the past they take awhile to dry. This particular deodorant dries quickly and leaves your armpits and clothes dry.  Overall, I'm happy with this product and I would purchase it in the future.	2015-08-15

I'm a huge fan of Disney, and Elsa is a character I heavily relate to, so seeing a beauty book of her I was sold! I love this palette! There are 8 shadows, a highlighter, 2 eyeliners, an eyeshadow brush, and a lip color (kind of a liquid lipstick) and for $12 (Walgreen's price) its totally worth it!<br />The eyeshadow are so nice! Love the pigmentation and texture! Very soft and nice! I only had one dud and that was the color called &#34;Elsa&#34; which is the purple color. That shadow is pretty bad. Not pigmented and pretty much had hardpan when I bought it. Which sucks. But the other colors do make up for it!<br />The highlighter is my personal favorite thing from this beauty book! It's such a nice texture and is very shimmery! It's a very intense highlight but if you tap off the brush its very nice and subtle-ish 😉 lasts all day and look stunning on the face!<br />The eyeliners are okay as well! Not incredible, but not awful! One does have shimmer so, be cautious if you want to wear it in the waterline (I would assume it would be fine, just be aware of the glitter in it! 💖)<br />The brush is awesome! I use it for both packing on eyeshadows and blending! I've washed it around 3 times since I've gotten it and have had no shedding! Very soft as well!<br />The lip color is a mix between a lip gloss and a liquid lipstick. Very pigmented and has a great texure, but it doesn't dry matte and has a bit of shine. I love it! Not sure of the staying power though! I think it lasted maybe 1-2 hours? Which isn't bad but not something I'd necessarily reach for if I'm going out for longer than that.<br />Overall id give this palette a 4.5 stars. Only because the Elsa shadow is a very bad shadow and you'd assume that would be the stand out shade. But I would highly recommend for anyone who likes Disney, Frozen, and Makeup! 💖💖💖	2015-08-15

They separate my lashes get off any clumps and allow you to do several passes to build lashes without looking over coated.  I don't know about their normal use but they are perfect for lash separation and you can use one over and over until it gets too coated so the pack will probably last me a year.  Really works well used to use a straight pin or a safety pin when I was younger this is so much safer.  Even though I use an awesome mascara that has a great brush these take it to another level.	2015-08-15

I recommend it highly. I've shaved head and face, and wifey has shaved legs, underarm, and bikini, no cuts for either of us. She loves it, she's never going back to disposables.  It should handle any decent blade well. I've used Supermax and Supermax Blue, with Feather up next. The cost is a fraction of disposables and with plenty of lather and rinsing the shave is better than any disposable I've ever owned. We're happy, and you deserve to be too!	2015-08-15

Before trying this deodorant, none of them did the trick. I put some on, let it dry and then get dressed. I remain odor free all day and don't have to worry about deodorant marks.I usually buy the secret clinical protection but was kind of turned off by the powdery feeling of the soft solid. This Outlast clear gel works just as well, if not better than the clinical protection and has that nice smooth gel feel that doesn't leave any residue behind in your shirt. I think I'll end up buying this kind from now on. *I received the product as part of a promotion from BZZAGENT, this is my own opinion.&#34;	2015-08-15

I've got to say, I just received this brush set and it does not compare to the other ones I own. I love real techniques but I think these are fake, no I KNOW these are fake. The fan brush looks like it's falling apart. The make of the brushes look decent but when you look closer you can tell that the same materials aren't being used in comparison to the regular real techniques line. It is plastic at the bottom- a cheap looking plastic. Also the writing &#34;real techniques by sam and nic chapman&#34; are on the wrong side. If you do a side by side comparison to real ones you will see what I'm talking about. If you look at the real ones, the writing should be on the other side of the brush. Plus the text should not be black in colour. Bristles are frayed and seem so fragile I'm scared to even use them, especially for the price I paid. I'm sure I can still use these brushes, but for me to pay 43 dollars us (converted to canadian 50) is absolutely ridiculous. Buyers beware and do not buy from this seller. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON FAKES.	2015-08-15

I recommend brushing or combing through the piece of hair right before you put it in the tool so it most likely won't get tangled up in it. IT DEFINITELY IS HARD ON YOUR HAIR WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE TOOL!! The process of pulling out the tangled hair from the tool not only burns the hair, but it breaks it. Personally, I don't plan on curling my hair every day (probably once every other week) so this is perfect for me, but if you are going to use it every day, it seems more damaging than your every day curling iron.	2015-08-15

I was skeptical, but decided to try it after reading the great reviews.  It comes with multiple brush heads, but so far I have only used the small brush for the face.  It provides strong exfoliation without irritation.  I feel like it definitely gives my face a deep clean.  I wouldn't use it every day, but more like twice a week.  It's nice that it can be used in the shower if need be, although I have been afraid to get it that wet.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it catches my long hair on the sides of my face, even with a tight headband on, so you can't get too close to the hairline with it.	2015-08-15

I was glad that it did provide full blockage from light.  But,  it was  velcro closure.  I had it as tight as I could possibly close it and it still slipped off my head because the elastic had quickly stretched out.  The adjustable clasp with this one is much more secure on my head but not at all uncomfortable.  The nose coverage area is also smaller but that actually works way better for my face shape and nose.  I have not used the ear plugs.  I feel like I have tiny ears or something because even the tiniest Warburg are painful for me.  I will not be using those.  For the cost,  the comfort and clasp of this mask,  you are definitely getting a quality product.  I ordered the green one first.  I would like to order another one soon just to have an alternative.  I seem to be very sensitive to light when sleeping.  Even the little dot on my phone charging is  distracting.  This really helps me to refocus on trying to get to sleep if I pop my eyes open and it's pitch black.  The molded cups are fantastic and do not prevent me from opening my eyes.  Love this mask!	2015-08-15

I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now.	2015-08-15

The jar looks legit, and maybe it is (just the jar though), but the cream absolutely will not do anything for wrinkles or fine lines the way the real DHC product does.<br /><br />I've been using this cream for a month and it's done nothing for fine lines. When I used the tiny free sample that the real DHC sent me in the mail, I saw a noticeable visible improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth within only 3 days.<br /><br />Save your time and money and just buy directly from DHC, seriously. This stuff doesn't even smell like the real thing because it's lacking the ingredient that diminishes the appearance of wrinkles.<br /><br />I gave this product 2 stars for &#34;I don't like it&#34; instead of 1 star for &#34;I hate it&#34; because at the very least I can still use it as a very basic moisturizer.<br /><br />Spend your money patronizing businesses that actually give you a high-quality product that works instead of individuals who are just looking to make a quick buck ripping you off.	2015-08-15

Ive purchased a few different types, and this is my second purchase of this one. The first one failed after, perhaps five years. That seems fair to me.<br />My beard is typically about 4-5 days growth, trimmed very close.<br />Reasons to like it:<br />1) it's ine of very few on the market that are adjustable with a slide switch - adjustable w/o adding attachments. That means  whether I go with the grain or against it, I have many options to keep my beard at a very controlled SHORT length.<br />2) Battery life is very good.<br />3) product life is very good<br />4) Price is fair.

I used to to heal a piece on my knee cap and it seemed to work well but not any better than other non-scented lotions. The main problem is that it doesn't really soak into your skin; it just sits on top. Prepare to feel greasy! It also rubs off fairly easily. However, the smell is absolutely amazing! Seriously if I could eat this stuff I would, it's the best smelling lotion I've ever experienced! It's also got all natural ingredients which is a plus.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend it but not over lubriderm or a similar un-scented lotion, as those tend to soak into your skin a little better.	2015-08-15

You just put a small amount on your finger or a q-tip and apply to the skin tag 3 times a day. Now I am starting to see some changes, and am confident with a little more time that my skin tags will be gone.  Only reason this did not get a 5 star rating is that it did not work as quick as expected, but it is working, just slowly.<br />I have had no issues as others have described, I am happy with this, and would recommend to my family and friends.<br />I was provided a sample at a discounted price to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

US	1657122	RLX1YT7EM6MAO	B00IP42FBA	612248691	InstaNatural Organic Rosehip Seed Oil - 100% Pure & Unrefined Virgin Oil - Natural Moisturizer for Face, Skin, Hair, Stretch Marks, Scars, Wrinkles & Fine Lines - Omega 6, Vitamin A & C - 4 Oz	Beauty	4	1	2	N	Y	Linoleic Acid for Acne Prone guys and gals	I'm currently making the transition into using more natural beauty products in my nightly routine to encourage healthy cell growth and keep wrinkles at bay. I may only be 21, but I've come to fully understand that prevention is key!<br /><br />Anyways, the sizing of this bottle is very generous for the price, the bottle came packaged well and sealed properly. 1 star there.<br />The smell was fine- it smelled slightly of roses and oil, as I fully expected- not rancid (thankfully). I'm not in love with the smell but it smells as it should. +1 star.<br />I'm happy to note that the product does not irritate my acne prone skin, nor does it cause break outs- it absorbs into my skin quickly and goes on very lightly (yay!). It's still an oil so I wouldn't recommend applying it in the morning, but it works wonderfully as a night-time wrinkle/moisturizing treatment. (especially around the eyes)<br /><br />That being said it is advised to those who have moderate/severe acne to avoid direct application to trouble areas, but rosehip seed oil has a higher percentage of Linoleic acid  (44%) compared to Oleic acid (14%) which is richer and more likely to cause problems for those with acne. I don't apply this oil to my trouble areas on the sides of my forehead, but I've been applying it to minor trouble areas on the sides of my cheeks (note: MINOR) and haven't experienced any breakouts. 2 more stars right there baby.<br /><br />Overall this product is pretty great, hasn't caused me any problems yet (which is saying a lot because I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts)- but I haven't seen any results either so until then I'll leave off the 1 star. When I do notice any changes I'll be sure to come back and revise this :)<br /><br />P.S. if you have acne prone skin I highly suggest doing some research into Linoleic vs Oleic acids- skin is very delicate and should be taken care of properly with the proper products for your skin type :)	2015-08-15

This LOUISE MAELYS Short 32cm Anime Character Cosplay Full Wigs Party Costume Orange is not only really cute but it's also very comfortable! The thought of me wearing a short AND orange wig was actually a pretty scary thought, however, after putting it on I actually really like it! This does say &#34;costume&#34; but you could actually wear this on any given day for whatever reason you want.<br /><br />This wig is very easy to put on and you can actually play with it a little bit to get a few different &#34;styles&#34;. I was actually able to put it on backwards and get another style out of it which I think is really cool because having a wig that can be &#34;changed&#34; is a great way to be able to find what's best for you and how you would like it to look. The orange color on this wig is very vibrant and pretty; definitely an eye catcher! My fiance's favorite color is orange so it was really fun to put this wig on before he got home from work and him walking in to see me in his favorite color! He actually smiled and said it looked very pretty (not sure if he was lying or not but either way it got a smile out of him so my plan worked). I would definitely recommend this LOUISE MAELYS Short 32cm Anime Character Cosplay Full Wigs Party Costume Orange!<br /><br />!My pictures are with and without flash. The flash actually helps show the vibrant-ness of the orange!<br /><br />**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**	2015-08-15

I made a Shea cream with sweet almond oil, olive oil, vitamin e, rosemary, rosehip, juniper and frankincense essential oils. I use this oil all over my body including my hair. It is extremely moisturizing.  I have received this product in exchanger reviewing. I would highly recommend.	2015-08-15

I have only had this one week and used it three times so far without any dryness or irritation. I do not have any exposure to the sun so am unable to know if there is irritation with that. I was especially pleased with packaging of the product as it was protected in a small box. The two ounce bottle is very generous and the pump dispenses the serum perfectly. Also the consistency of the serum is thick enough that there was no waste of it. The last brand I used was thin like water and it ran out of my hand no matter what and the pump squirted it so forcefully sometimes it made more of a mess than anything.<br />  I am impressed with the personal attention I received from the company representative who sent me information about the product before I received it and to my surprise, she answered two other specific questions I had when I asked. This type of personal service is hard to find these days and something that I value. I am an &#34;old timer&#34; that remembers when everyone was helpful.<br />  Despite my age and due to medication, I have facial break outs still and this serum has already helped.

We have a 40ish male, with thicker facial hair and a 20ish year old with much less, finer facial hair. The shaver wasn't something the 40ish year old liked. He said the shaver did not allow for a close shave that he prefers. He complained it didn't get as close to hard to get places, around the nose. But he did say this is why he never uses electric shavers, this is no different. Now, the 20ish year old loved it. He said he thought it shaved close and was easy to handle even for his large hands. The shave was close for him and it allowed him to shave in a hurry.<br /><br />My thought is the hair on my husband is too thick, and there is too much for this shaver and my sons hair is thinner and easier to shave for this &#34;economical&#34; priced shaver. I think my husband would need a heavier duty shaver for him to be happier.	2015-08-15

My hair was actually not very damaged, so the result wasn't as dramatic as it might have been, but I do see a difference. I have been doing a single process red on my hair for a LONG time, and I've always been pretty good about doing a treatment of some sort after every color, so again, my hair wasn't really very damaged, but 20 plus years of  coloring your hair every 5 to 6 weeks... it wasn't perfect either. I followed the single color process directions from their website, and put a super tiny amount of the no. 1 (.125 oz) into my base color and processed as usual. Rinsed that out, and put on the no. 2 for 20 minutes. washed my hair and did my normal post color conditioning treatment. It feels pretty good, and it does feel fuller. Pardon the crummy selfie before and after - I'd been up about 5 minutes in the before, so yeah.. a little rough. :-)	2015-08-15

And it makes a lot of sense to have a treatment for oil to NOT contain oil.

I was nervous to order because I really can't stand the smell of roses. Therefore I do not like the smell of this product. That is just a personal thing. Nothing to do with the product. After about 10-15 minutes I don't seem to smell it anymore and have asked my husband if I smell like roses and he says no. Thank goodness for that!  I spray it on my face after washing it and it feels very nice. It feels like it tightens the skin without making it feel dry. The biggest reason I bought it is for my hair. I hope that it helps with the dryness  I get on the ends. Typical hair products are full of silicones and oils. I have a closet full of them. Even really pricey products like Kerastase.  I really like how this is working. I feel like it helps the health of my hair without weighing it down or drying it out. I have only been using for a few days but I am hopeful that I will continue to see a nice improvement with my hair and skin.  So far I would say I will repurchase.<br />Btw, the emails I have received from the company after purchasing shows that they really care about your happiness in your purchase. I imagine if you had a problem with a broken bottle or something like that, they would take excellent care of you.	2015-08-15

It works one day and then the next won't turn on.  I called and emailed Conair and told them of the issues and they did replace one, but I had to pay to ship it to them.  I explained that they had a quality problem but they did not care.  I asked to talk to a manager and they would not connect me to one.  I then tried emailing and they did not respond.

When I do get one I apply a little and it dries it out. I can actually feel it working. Very happy with the product and its a great price point. Thank you!	2015-08-15

My preference has always been natural skin care products and this by far tops my list. I absolutely love this hand cream. I felt a difference within a few days! My hands are much softer now and it amazingly doesn't wash completely off after washing your hands.  I love the fragrance, and  lavender is one of my faves.  I like how this product is combined with a hint of citrus scent; such a great combination. The texture is light and airy, similar to a creamy whipped souffle.	2015-08-15

I really liked this cleanser -  it leaves no make up on your face. After I cleaned my face I checked with a make up  remover on a cotton pad to see if the skin is really clean (I use liquid foundation ever day)  -  the cotton pad was clean and spotless, which is what I was looking for. It does not remove the mascara well but I remove it separately anyway.<br /><br />I do also have dry sensitive skin and the cleanser does in fact leave a dry feeling. However, I usually follow with a Toner and it solves the problem easily.<br /><br />I would suggest to the manufacturer to work on the aroma of the product - it has a bit of a scent of a perfume for men. It's not flowery nor sweet, like the most cosmetics products for women. Personally I would have preferred to leave it totally unscented.	2015-08-15

It was just coarse enough to exfoliate my skin without feeling like I was scrubbing it off. The Kona coffee was the perfect boost for the mind and body. The caffeine helped me wake up while showering in the morning and also improved the look of my skin. Upon rinsing, my skin felt like heaven. It was the perfect balance of moisture.

Best smelling perfume on earth 😳 This perfume was made for me 😳After smelling this I fell head over heels jack&rose titanic type of love with this. after smelling this perfume other perfumes/colognes were like a joke to me. This is my second bottle. The first I stole from my sister lol she is a perfume/cologne junkie When my first bottle finished I went to Bloomingdales to get a new one, took it home and realized the one in the new box didn't smell the same. And it was pink. The original was a very light wash of yellow I took it back and told them it smelled different. They said they both smell the same to them. The thing is they had the real deal on display and was selling the fake ones. I told them I was willing to get the one display even tho it was used up but you know they said no 😏 They then blindfolded me in the store lol they had me smell the one on display then made me smell coffee beans then made me smell the one in the box. They were so surprised I could tell the difference lol I personally think the ones in the store that are refillable smells so fruity and fake. I've become a Thierry Mugler womanity insanity lol I know my baby. When purchasing this I was so scared but when I got it was so happy to be reunited with the real deal. Whenever I wear this I get at least 5 compliments a day of how good I smell. When I wore the one I purchased from Bloomingdales I got none. That was another reason I knew it wasn't the same.  Womanity just how that sounds. I have a lot of perfumes and colognes and I'm looking at them like what a waste of money.

I got to purchase this oil for a reduced price in exchange of my reviews and am completely satisfied with this brand. So much that once I finish this bottle I am going to buy another bottle of this same brand. I have lots of acne scars on my face. I use this oil to massage my scars at night and leave it on. The oil is on the greasier side so is best applied at night. The smell is strong but not to bothering at all. You get used to it after some time. I am yet to see the effect on scars as it will take at least one month to see any changes as my scars are too old. But my face is no more dry and scaly ,rough and itchy. This oil acts as a conditioner for my face. In the morning I can't avoid touching my face because after many years my face feels smooth and nourished. I will update my review after a couple months if I see any major change in my scars which I am sincerely hoping will diminish with it.	2015-08-15

I used to use Burts Bee lip balm but it never kept my lips this moisturized so I ordered Smiths rose bud & eucalyptus  salve but I started to get a reaction to those.

Now that I'm halfway through the tube, I can say that although it's very effective at blocking the sun and pretty decent under makeup, I probably won't repurchase. My face and alcohol don't get along, and applying this is like dousing my face in a martini. It smells very alcoholic and has that tell-tail &#34;cooling&#34; effect that alcohol has (plus alcohol is listed right there at the top of the ingredients list). Alcohol is drying and causes faster aging, and unfortunately it is the first or second ingredient in a lot of beauty products. Besides this, it is really a great sunscreen. It doesn't wear off and creates a nice makeup base. It's non-shiney and doesn't cause breakouts for me at least. But I do feel that it's somewhat drying especially around my eyes, which is why I'll keep looking for the perfect sunscreen.	2015-08-15

I used this today for the first time and loved it. It went on very smoothly with no hint of white sunscreen.

It is after 11:00 p.m. and after so looking forward to being able to sleep tonight knowing that if my mother-in-law who suffers from dementia wanders during the night the new Wireless Wander door alarm we purchased would alert us. It didn't work last night when she got up, but we thought maybe our battery was old so we purchased a new one today. Not the case. Inconsistent alarms, if it alarms at all. So we tried the Wander Alarm with Motion Detector that we bought at the same time as a backup. Also DOES NOT WORK. So now I get to pull the packaging and receipts out and try to figure out how to go through the hassle of returning both --- which is something I loathe doing!

Didn't they even do any focus groups before they released this, to let people try it out? The old formula was clear and silky, and soaked right into your skin, whereas the new formula is thick and viscous, almost like glue, and when it dries it feels a bit like having a dried egg white mask on your face - ugh.  Also seems like false advertising that they have more than 4500 reviews that are all based on the OLD formula, which was great. This new formula is awful - I'm sending it back for a refund. Update: I got a refund, but their customer service was not very friendly about it. They didn't seem to care that a previously loyal customer was upset by them drastically changing the formula and raising the price.	2015-08-15

Klutz-proof ;)	I have used this twice with good results. The processing time is 20 minutes or less, depending on how your hair holds a curl. I have naturally wavy hair but the waves and curls are not very uniform. This gives me the amount of curl I want while still looking natural. I have used it twice and nobody has asked if I have had a perm.<br />Update: I just used this again, and seriously, even a klutz will get good results. I covered my head with rods, but not in the tidy rows in the directions. And thinking I remembered the process, I didn't mix part A and B -- oops-- so I applied part B after part A and hoped it would still turn out okay.Still turned out great ! I also varied the rod size for a natural look. When I first reviewed this my product hair was just below my shoulders, now it is a medium length bob.This gave me more bounce, definition and curl than my naturally wavy hair.I used it for the minimum amount of processing time with good results ( 12 minutes). It says not to shampoo immediately after, but I would recommend a leave-in conditioner or hair serum to pamper those fresh waves or curls.	2015-08-15

I couldn't wait to try out this epilator as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my old epilator. For those who are not familiar with epilators, the Braun series 7 epilator is one of Braun's more expensive products that has added features to make sure that the device is relatively easy and painless to use. The massaging cap and built in light make it so much easier to spot tiny hairs and epilate without too much pain.  This product has two speed settings and several attachment heads that can be used depending on the area that needs to be epilated. I would recommend using the lowest setting on areas like the legs or arms, where there is generally thicker hair and more hair growth. In this way, the epilator can grab the hair from the root without breakage. So far, I have only used the sensitive area cap and the shaver cap. The razor is wonderful; you could just use this product for the razor attachment to be honest. I have never had a smoother shave! The sensitive area cap is not as effective at grabbing hairs compared to the regular epilator without a cap. I actually preferred not using a cap for my legs and bikini area. The charge lasts a fairly long time with this epilator. After plugging it into the outlet, it had full charge within an hour. After doing both my legs and armpits (approx. 40 minutes) , it was still working which was great! Overall, I am really impressed with this product! It is easy enough to use for beginners, but also advanced enough with multiple features that long time users can also enjoy it.<br /><br />Tips and Tricks for People New to Epilating:<br />- Epilating for the first time will definitely be painful, but I promise the pain will lessen after a few uses! Try numbing cream or taking a painkiller 30 minutes before epilating if you have a very low pain threshold.<br />-Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate! Exfoliate with a good scrub before and after epilating to prevent ingrown hairs. This is so important. Unless you want to manually pluck every in grown hair out, you need to exfoliate.<br />-Use aloe vera gel or another type of soothing ointment after epilating. It can really calm down the redness and irritation that happens after epilation.<br />-Applying baby powder onto the areas that you are about to epilate can help dry up any excess water or residue that is left on the skin. It's easier for the device to grab dry hairs vs wet hairs.<br />-Make sure that your hair is the correct length before epilating. I think the optimal length is 2mm-5mm. When the hairs are too long, their is a lot of breakage and left over stubble, which defeats the purpose of using an epilator haha.	2015-08-15

LARGE Size Facial Moisturizer For Youthful Radiant Skin | Enriched with Green Tea, Vitamin E & B5	Beauty	4	0	0	N	N	positive result	My face is really sensitive so I have been looking for a product that doesn't cause more problems and actually helps with my aging skin. It's actually a hard thing to find. I had been somewhat pleased with this product. It doesn't cause a breakout but with my sensitive skin and the 0.5% of retinol, it will dry a little more than I like but I think with the other moisturizer (coconut oil) I use in between really helps. It takes time for your skin to become acclimated to a new product. I personally would not use it three times a day but I have sensitive skin. I have freckles and it has helped the discoloration of my skin from around the bottom of my nose and under the eyes to the cheek area. This is a plus because I have cosmetically cover that usually and don't as much now. Hopefully I will have better even better news in a month.

I have never used shave cream like this before, but it is GREAT!!! some of the reviewers complain that it doesn't smell like Sandalwood, which in comparison to oils and incense, they are most likely right, BUT no matter, the smell is, as one reviewer put it: &#34;like the old barber shop smell of the old days&#34; and he's right AND the women LOVE it. My wife said that it smelled &#34;Manly&#34; and that's good enough for me. I'm looking into getting more of these Taylor of Old Bond Street toiletries because I like the smell of the shave cream so much, I want the rest of me to smell that good!!! would I buy it again? IN A HEARTBEAT!!! OH! and the shave? I'm using a Mach 3 Gillette right now and the cream made the shave, smooth as glass, I don't have a tough beard, about average, but the very few nicks I did get, the cream seemed to stop the bleeding, without the sting that the alum sticks give. BOTTOM LINE: Very GOOD product.	2015-08-15

Beauty	5	0	0	N	Y	As effective as Oz Naturals facial cleanser at a lower price!!	I was using Oz Naturals, and had great results aside from the the intense stinging if i get it near my eyes. So, I was looking for an alternative, and did not find a suitable one. In my search, I tried this product. It worked great for clearing any mild acne breakouts that I may have had, without over-drying my skin (just like the Oz Naturals).  Unfortunately, it still has the stinging effect on the eyes. I compared labels, and the formula in this product is identical to Oz Naturals at almost $10 less. So, not finding anything that works better on my skin without burning my eyes, I've stuck with Earthen Beauty for the results and the price. I've adapted to being unable to use it to remove my eye make up (I use organic jojoba or sesame oil and then follow up with this cleanser), because I haven't found anything that keeps my face smooth and blemish free like this does.	2015-08-15

I am 66 years old and beginning to get the sag wrinkles on the sides of my cheeks. The sag wrinkles are beginning to plump and becoming less pronounced. I will have to say that this is one of the better creams I have used in a very long time.<br />I must thank the company for the opportunity to give you my totally honest opinion of this produce that they sent me at no charge.

I have naturally dark brown hair and I have been highlighting it (with bleach, done professionally) to blonde for about a year now. It doesn't act as much of a cleaning shampoo, but it definitely brings out my highlights and makes my hair brighter, especially right after I wash it. My friends notice the difference and it is obvious in pictures. I use a regular shampoo first, then I let this shampoo sit on my hair for five minutes then rinse it out and put more on for another five minutes. For the conditioner, I mix it in with a regular conditioner and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. The only drawback to these products is that they dry out your hair, so if you notice your hair dried out or breaking, I recommend using a hydrating shampoo to go along with this.	2015-08-15

It gets EXTREMELY tangled and can be impossible to comb after a shower. I saw this elixir in a YouTube video and the girl recommended a lot of products I'd already tried and this one. She said this one was the best of the bunch and was her &#34;cream of the crop&#34;, so I had to try it. And OMG IT'S AMAZING! I only spritz it 1-2 times if my hair is really tangled, or I wear it at night. It really is an elixir. It takes away any tangles better than anything I've ever tried, and I've tried A LOT. It also smells really, really good (all Shea Moisture products smell great). It leaves my hair shiny, soft, tangle free, and frizz free. Can't say enough good things about this. If your hair is extremely dry or tangled, try this. It's better than It's a 10, Pantene, argan oil, and every detangling product I've tried (which is A TON). I even like that it's called an elixir because that's exactly what it was for me.	2015-08-15

You can make your eyelashes huge-very buildable. The first few times, they looked a little gunky, but then somehow you just get better at applying. The fibers do flake off if you mess with them too much, or if you don't set them well with the gel, but I didn't find them getting into my eyes much. They give a dramatic enough look that I actually felt like I didn't need any other make up on. I'm not a fan of the way false lashes feel, so this will be my go to glam mascara if I have some time to spare to put it on (I'm just OCD about it looking right). Overall, a great few new concept  - definitely cheaper than some of the others out there, but this is my first fiber mascara so I can't comment on the quality in comparison to the others.	2015-08-15

My hair has always pulled red mind you, no matter if I use ash based color or neutral. After buzzing my hair 5 months ago, I decided to finally do something different once it grew out to a normal length. I bleached my natural hair color for 45 minutes with Keleidoscope Blue bleach from Sally's with 30 volume developer for 45 minutes. My hair came out a yellow tone on the roots, with orange on the tips. Which is natural for me when bleaching my hair. I decided to do a the smokey pink permanent hair color from Sally's just to see what it would it do. It was awful. My hair was still orange and added no pink whatsoever. That's when turned to &#34;Shark Blue&#34;. I slapped it onto my &#34;orange&#34; hair with a processing cap and let it sit for an hour and a half. I didn't dilute it with water or anything like some other users on here have done. I did occasionally put my hair dryer on it to give it some heat. Once I rinsed it in cool water it came out a grey/blue color which I'm obsessed with. I plan on getting violet shampoo and not washing it for a couple days at a time to maintain the color. But needless to say I'm very pleased.	2015-08-15

It looked watered down and a little oily.  I got a little on my fingers and it didnt even stain, just rubbed right out when normally I get a bright red stain.

Beauty	5	0	2	N	N	Good things does come in small package!	My dry and chappy looking hands needed help (badly) and this product could not have been recommended to me at a better time.  Yes, I tried a variety of different home remedies for softer and younger looking hands from scrubbing with baking soda to soaking in oil and warm milk.  I am not saying it doesn't work but not even stay at home mom will have time to go through this tedious regime on regular basis.<br /><br />Which is why Sundari Neem Hand Oil is like an answer to my prayers.  This super neat size bottle with clever roller ball applicator is so well design that it does not create any mess on application.  I was skeptical initially to switch from regular hand cream to oil base but I was sold after first use.  Not only it has a refreshing fragrant but within seconds after applying, it leaves no trace of oil nor grease.  I like to think it's soaked right into my hand!!<br /><br />It may seems like you will finish the tiny bottle in no time but let me tell you, after the first two weeks, it does not even appear to leave any dent!  It have just found an easier and convenient way to keep my hand soft and nice looking. This has just become a &#34;must have&#34; in my handbag.  It's a keeper and my Xmas shopping has just become easier!	2015-08-15

Didn't expect much but I was horribly wrong! They work better than anything I've ever used. No more messy oily makeup remover.

I dampen the towel, apply my facial cleaner and gently wipe all my makeup off in mere minutes. Rinse the wipe with mild hand soap to remove the makeup residue, wring and hang dry for the next use. They are machine washable just don't use fabric softener or dry sheets. I have accidentally included them in a load where I used fabric softener and it did not effect their effectiveness. I do try to avoid it though as long term used of fabric softener does build up residue in fabrics especially microfiber.<br /><br />They are cheaper in Wal-Mart so do a little looking around or if you don't have time buy them here, they are worth every penny!	2015-08-15

Pros<br />* Cleans Pores<br />* Removes Dirt<br />Cons<br />* Painful to peel off<br />* Can dry/irritate skin<br /><br />I love pore strips. I'm always that type of person who likes to take great care of their skin and is always up to date on the latest products. I have been using these strips for a couple years now and I love them! If you use them regularly (every 3 days) it keeps your pores clean so they don't get clogged and form blackheads. Although, my only complaint is the pain when you pull them off. It only lasts a minute but it still hurts. But if you're someone who has a high pain tolerance, you won't have any problems. I love these strips! They're a must have.	2015-08-15

I purchased the mirage diffuser just over a year ago and was initially very happy with the functioning, but less than 6 months later, the misting action was barely working and unit shuts off before the oil has been diffused.  I use high quality essential oils and have tried cleaning it after each use with vinegar/water solution. Unit will work slightly better for a brief time (a few minutes) and then quits. I have contacted ZAQ 4 times and they have not responded. I am very disappointed with ZAQs customer service.  While having difficulty with the Mirage, I purchased the ZAQ Allay, the Paradise and the Lotus models and they all put out MUCH more plume/mist and so far they continue working until all oil/water has been diffused, however, I have only had them 2-3 months, so we'll see if they last. I love ZAQ diffusers, while they work, but may need to plan to replace them every 6 months to a year.  It's unfortunate that  ZAQ does not stand behind their products and at the very least respond to emails.	2015-08-15

Can't really describe it, just not pleasant. Second, my skin broke out into a rash in my T-zone after using this for a few days, so I stopped using it. The rash went away the next day. I decided to just try it again just in case it was something else. I put it on, the rash was back the next day. So I've concluded without a doubt that it's this product. I've never had a face rash before this, I don't have sensitive skin either.<br /> I'm throwing this in the trash. Waste of 28 bucks.

When I received my product, some of the containers were kind of opened, and it had spilled a little in the bag, but at $5, I can't complain. Some of the spilled product cross contaminated my other colors. Glitter's difficult to clean, and I don't necessarily want light pink glitter mixed in with my other colors. However, if you want immaculate packaging, I suggest purchasing a set of glitter from Martha Stewart. There's a significant difference in price points though. The colors I received is different from what's shown in the picture. I assume that's because there are different sellers, but it would have been nice to have gotten some of the pastels that are shown in the picture. There's a pretty wide range of colors in the set I purchased, so I'm not unhappy. If I run out of glitter, I can see myself purchasing another set.

Wow it looked like I had fillers and botox. I am hooked on these. My holy grail of products and I have over 80 skin masks etc. My fave by far. Must get more. These came beautifully packaged.

This is the first epilator I've ever purchased/used, so I don't have a comparison to make with another type/brand.<br /><br />It came charged, which was very nice.  The first use was insanely painful.  Akin to waxing.  I had to take pain breaks.  But the following uses are less painful.<br /><br />This DOES NOT capture every hair.  I still had to use tweezers to remove hair here and there.  Does not prevent ingrown hairs.  (Other reviews have said they don't get ingrown hairs from this.)  And it needs to be cleaned between legs.  Hair gets caught in and under the head.  But it comes with a little brush, and it's very easy to sweep away the hair.<br /><br />I'm actually happy with it.  It is much easier/less messy than waxing.  And seems like hair does take longer to come back even compared to waxing.  Fast-charging.  And it's pinky and sparkly, which if you're a girly-girl, that's fun.	2015-08-15

I didn't wear shorts so my legs didn't get exposed to the sun that much, they're a different tone from my arms. This gives me my insecurity of wearing shorts.<br /><br />Seeing how this says it removes tan, I thought I'd give it a try. My first time I did on my arms I noticed the dead skin rolling off, i also used it on my legs. When I went to go tan (covering my arms and wearing a hat), I did notice my legs got a nice tan 2-3 days into it.<br /><br />When I use the mitten for the second time on my arms the dead skin rolled off, but the next day my arms barely looked lighter. It's true it gives you a nice tan, but i wouldn't recommend this to people with farmers tans. It also leaves your skin really smooth.	2015-08-15

I tanned all through my youth and prefer to be a dark color, but now I am in my 30s and have become all too aware of the sun's effect and aging. Well, I find this to be a terrific solution.  It's really not too dark but builds as dark as you want it to.  In fact under my spray I am whiter than white.  But a couple times a week I step in the tub and spray myself (I do it here because there's nothing to clean up- just turn the water on after you are done).  Then usually after thirty minutes to an hour I spray my legs and arms again.  I even spray my face during the first round.  The second round probably isn't necessary for most but I like to keep myself nice and brown. Also I should add that this stuff is dry in just a few minutes and has hardly any &#34;scent&#34;. I say scent because it's not a typical gross tanner smell.<br />I had a great realization how much better this stuff is the other day because I thought I could rub on some lotion the other day and succeed without any streaks or dark spots. Nope. I turned out horrible and had to scrub for days in the shower. Back to the spray for me. As long as you pay attention with even streaks you will be perfect.<br />I should also add that I use subscribe and save. I am never without a tan and I save money in the process.	2015-08-15

I dropped it down the stairs trying to carry it to her, and it survived. I was really impressed by that.<br /><br />Everything it says in the product description is truthful, and think about it -- when does a mirror have that thorough of a product description?

Yesterday, we went to the beach and she used used Honest Co. for the first time.  She came home with the most horrible sunburn ever!  The rest of the family used Walmart brand sunscreen, and none of us burned - she was the only one, and she applied more than any of the rest of us (also, she is more olive toned than any of the rest of us).  Therefore, the only problems came from this horrible sunscreen.<br /><br />Will be returning to Costco for a refund.  Protect your skin, and buy a different product.	2015-08-15

I really didn't want to believe how badly I was tearing up my gums with products like Oral B and Spinbrush battery-powered toothbrushes until I finally broke down and shelled out the $ for this product.  I have had worsening periodontal pockets for years, and my dentist's feedback has consistently been &#34;your teeth are really clean, but your gums are paying the price&#34;.  This Sonicare brush is a COMPLETELY different experience than my previous brushes - so gentle on my gums, and yet I can tell it's very effective as well.  I can't speak to the longevity and durability of this product, as I've only been using it several days, but as for what it does - excellent.  And I'm much happier to pay for this vs paying for gum grafting surgery, so hopefully a good investment in my health.  Also I don't find the quadpacer thing annoying at all, as some other reviewers have mentioned.  It is such a brief pause - more like just a momentary pulse vs a total shut-off that interrupts brushing.  Very pleased so far!	2015-08-15

I have been slowly thinning in the front since my early 30's (I'm 38 now) and was looking for a way to combat it. During my research I came across this product about 13 months ago. The reviews were mostly very positive, so I figured for the price it was worth giving it a shot. I was not looking to sprout tons of new hair or anything like that, but just to try and keep what I have as long as I can. I also wanted to wait before writing a review because you have to give hair loss products time to work.  I have not been using this shampoo for a little over 12 months now and I can happily say that it has done what I was hoping it would do, which is help me keep what I have. I have no noticeable hair loss in the last year, and in fact, my hair actually looks and feels thicker. I'm not sure if I have actually grown new hair or the shampoo has just made it look thicker, but I do know it looks better.  I got a haircut this morning and my stylist of 6 years told me that my hair looks and feels thicker than it has in several years, and that my scalp looks very healthy now. I use this every 2-3 days and leave it in 5-7 minutes while I shower. It lathers up very well, so you don't need to use a lot but you must make sure you massage it in very good as it needs to get in the hair follicles to be effective. I will update this review if anything changes for the positive or negative, but for now I'm very happy with this shampoo.	2015-08-15

I am fair skinned and have a hard time finding a natural looking, yet dark self-tanner.  I tried the Darksyde and loved it even more than Moroccan.  It smells better, has a darker brown color, less yellow as compared to morrocan, and doesn't stain - even temporarily.  Morrocan has not permanently stained my clothes however, once I put it on my skin I could not wear anything white, it would slowly seep through a white shirt during the day.  Darksyde has not stained any clothing after letting it dry 30 minutes or less or seeped through my shirt hours later while I sweat.  Amazing!  Since I use it frequently I will say it gets coppery/redish looking on fair skin and like most tanners tends to dry out the top layer of skin but not nearly as bad as other self-tanners and I only notice this after using it 4-5 times in a week.  I highly recommend the Ultimitt to apply evenly.	2015-08-15

These wipes a incredibly versatile and of much higher quality than most commercial wipes. They are very gentle on the skin and do not leave a residue. They are not heavily perfumed and are nice and thick. I have used them when caring for elderly parents recovery from various events and unable to bathe in the shower and most recently for my daughter after her surgery. Being able to warm the up for a few seconds in the microwave makes for a nice treat for someone who is bedridden! I also found them useful for keeping clean when I was in a leg cast and too tired to set everything up to bathe in the tub or shower. As a massage therapist I keep a pack in my traveling bag. I find them useful to keep refreshed if I am doing an outdoor event that is hot and sweaty. Many uses for a great product!	2015-08-15

I purchased the brush not for my beard, but for my hair.  I have thinning white hair that does not require a brush of extraordinary stiffness.  Yet I still wanted a quality boar bristle brush at a reasonable price.  This brush fits my needs perfectly.  It is stiff enough to easily brush my hair into place, but without leaving scratches in my scalp.  It is a perfect balance between stiff and soft.  I suspect that there are many other men and women of my age who no longer have a luxuriant head of hair, and don't want to abraid their scalp with the stiffness of some of the other high quality brushes.  I highly recommend they try this brush.	2015-08-15

I'll say right off the bat that if you're already using an electric toothbrush there's very little reason to switch to this kit unless you're looking for a cheaper replacement.<br /><br />►Toothbrushes:<br />The toothbrushes in this kit use two AA batteries (included) that fit in the handle. The common theme with these types of electric brushes are that they're generally a bit larger and more noisy than the more refined (and expensive) brands like Oral B and Sonicare. That is very much the case here with the brushes in this kit. The other negative for me is that I felt the brushes were a bit too stiff; I already have a bad habit of brushing too hard so paired with these stiffer brushes I'm not doing my teeth any favors.<br /><br />Each brush is considerably larger than both my Oral B and Sonicare brushes and features a multi-action head. I think they do a good enough job cleaning but again are considerably louder and offer a more jarring brushing experience.<br /><br />►Truly Radiant Toothpaste:<br />If you're familiar with Arm & Hammer toothpaste then you'll probably like the Truly Radiant formula. If you're not familiar with brushing with Arm & Hammer products then just be aware that these pastes feature baking soda as a primary ingredient. So your brushing experience will tend to be grittier than with other non-baking soda formulas. Personally the combination of baking soda and peroxide just leaves my teeth and mouth feeling cleaner than many of the other brands I've used in the past.<br /><br />My everyday brand is Arm & Hammer Complete Care Plus Whitening and honestly I'm not able to tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after using the Truly Radiant brand. I may consider ordering more but that will likely mostly be determined by price.<br /><br />►Included in the Kit:<br />1) 2 Spinbrush toothbrushes<br />2) 4 AA batteries<br />3) 4 Toothbrush heads<br />4) 1 Truly Radiant toothpaste tube<br /><br />►Closing Comments:<br />I think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product. If you find yourself in either group this is probably not a bad purchase. Amazon's product page currently doesn't have a price (item is unavailable) but looking at other retailers this does seem to fit within the budget conscious market of electric toothbrushes. Overall a good experience. Recommended if your needs align to what the product does.brushes<br />2) 4 AA batteries<br />3) 4 Toothbrush heads<br />4) 1 Truly Radiant toothpaste tube<br /><br />►Closing Comments:<br />I think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product.

It's complete with a double ponytail that's curly on the bottoms and has a bun on top. The wig is a gold color that is soft to the touch compared to other costume wigs I've purchased in the past. I have included pictures for reference.<br /><br />The wig is made from a high temperature wire that is of good quality. It fits using an adjustable hook located inside the cap part of the wig, so it always looks nicely fitted.<br /><br />The Anime Wig was for a costume I needed for a work party and it went perfectly with the rest of the ensemble. I'll be using it with my barmaid costume too. The wig can be combed gently if it becomes tangled during, or after wearing. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review. Regardless, I'm very happy with the product and would happily purchase.	2015-08-15

So the smell was not exactly the same straight out of the can (thank goodness)<br /><br />2.Appearances: there's no doubt about it! This stuff will make your bath nice and white- it's like taking a milk bath :D (depending on how much you put it). At first the powder floats on the top, then sinks into a cloud of white and spans out into the water by itself. Very lovely.<br /><br />3. Texture: This salt isn't grainy in the water at all :) it's not like putting epsom salt into the tub- like how you end up with irritating salt grains left over at the bottom. Nope, it's mostly powder like, a bit grainy in appearance but it blends into the water perfectly<br /><br />4.Size: The size of the canister is pretty good- I was expecting a lot less but indeed it is a pretty good amount (and better be for $17!)<br /><br />Overall I really like this product, I'm more than sure it will last me a long time :) Thank you Japan!<br /><br />EDIT****************************************<br /><br />I bought this bath powder again excited to be able to use it after a hiatus from baths- and while the seller was excellent and the item came well packaged and fast I realized that the formula for the product had changed. This new bath powder does NOT smell good. It smells really strong and almost manly. It burned my nostrils :(<br />Not only that but I could tell the formula had changed because the canister changed as well- rather than a regular finish- the canister was metallic- it had the same pattern but it's metallic red and orange. Don't get me wrong the change was beautiful- but the smell? awful. Very disappointed in the formula change. I'd post a picture but I gave this away to a friend as soon as I had drained the bath water- I wasn't even able to take my bath without my nose hurting.la change.

It is a sample size, not a full tube size.  The Fill &amp; Freeze is the key to this product working.

They last a really long time and honestly just look incredible! It is the only thing I wear these days, and I get to kiss my husband and he never has to worry about color rubbing off! :)  One unfortunate thing I've noticed with the colors I bought off of Amazon has been that the colors may gunk up and flake/roll (kind of like how when you use a pencil eraser you get those rolled flakes) after you have had them on for a while. I never had this problem with any that I bought in store, but I've had this issue with 3 of the colors I got on Amazon. I wonder if they are older? Or maybe some kind of off brand? I'm not sure why it happens, but I was very surprised because I hadn't ever had this problem. Unfortunately I found this problem out for the first time during the photo shoot on my wedding day, so we just had to rub the lipstick off and go the rest of the day with no lipstick. I hadn't brought any to touch up because in the past the lip color had always lasted 10 hours or more. Just goes to show - never use something for the first time on your wedding day!!	2015-08-15

I could feel a negative reaction from my skin but continued to use it anyway in the hopes of getting rid of the dark circles so I can only blame myself. After using this product not only did the dark circles remain, but I also saw/felt that the skin under my eyes got thinner and saggy when I smile after using this product. I have stopped using it but I wanted to warn others. This product was harsh on my face and I regret having used it since I now have saggy under eye skin when I smile.	2015-08-15

He has experienced a healthier beard and softer skin in the days since he's been using both products.<br /><br />With this cleanser, you receive quite a bit. You only need a small amount to wash your face. It is a nice, gentle cleanser, and contains DMAE, Vitamin B5, and Retinol, along with several other ingredients including organic aloe leaf juice, organic olive oil, and organic lavender. I liked that it had several organic ingredients.<br /><br />The facial cleanser, like the beard oil, features a nozzle that dispenses oil pump by pump. This allows you to get what you need, without getting too much. It also prevents a mess, which I appreciate, since I am the one who has to clean the bathroom. *Smile*<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice, gentle cleanser, great for any man. It would be a nice gift to include in a gift basket full of other products, like beard oil, shaving products, etc.<br /><br />* Product provided in exchange for an unbiased review.

Beauty	5	0	0	N	N	It smells fresh!	This may be an odd note to start on, but the first thing I noticed about this aloe gel was that it SMELLS better than past aloe products I've bought. It doesn't smell old or overly sweet, but kind of light and green, if that makes sense. I'm also really pleased with how little has been added to it, only a thickener for skin application, and a few preservatives to prevent bacterial growth; otherwise, it's pure aloe vera! I got this at a steep discount through snagshout, but I'm very willing to give it a go a second time around even without the snagshout price.	2015-08-15

Rosacea coverage is my number one factor in foundation.  This covers so well, and makes my face the entire same color.  No break outs, no clogged pores, no scent.  I wore no makeup to work one day and everyone asked if I was ok because my face was so red.  Got a sunburn?  Perfect coverage, no one will know!  Now I know how to be able to go home sick!!!  I also use the pressed powder to set my foundation because it is not a &#34;wet&#34; foundation that will dry into a matte.  I do NOT use the applicator, seems to waste too much, I unscrew the lid with the applicator on it and just use a small squeeze per cheek and a little more for forehead coverage and I am all set to use the powder.  Coverage lasts all day. I can come home and touch up my powder before going out and it looks all fresh again.<br />I HIGHLY recommend if you need it for flaw coverage.  My daughter uses it to hide her acne scars.  She is multi-racial and just uses the mineral wear powder/bronzer for darker tones.	2015-08-15

The Aircast SP was better, more comfortable and effective, but not by much. This boot is similar in design and appears to be better made, but has the same issues. The biggest complaint I have is that the plastic outer cover is supposed to go over the inflation and deflation bulbs that are built into the liner, but the smaller deflation bulb would slip under the cover and was constantly getting pressed by the cover as it shifted, thus deflating the air bladders and causing the boot to fit loosely. Also, the toe cap at the front seems like a good idea, but anything that gets in doesn't come out without removing the boot. After three weeks of use, the rubber that holds the plastic outer cover together had broken and the ankle strap was giving out. Still, this is a good boot. The liner is good, it's pretty comfy, and the bladder setup is very good when it was inflated. I just prefer the Aircast SP. It's more comfortable and the inflation setup is simpler and works.	2015-08-15

Not happening. Also, the wattage is so low that I had to air dry my hair for nearly an hour first.Otherwise it would have taken me over half an hour to dry using the styler immediately after shampooing. That additional time for air drying is not always an option. My hair is chin length on the sides and very short in the back. Although my hair is quite thick it isn't long. This dryer does help remove some of the frizz, but I still need to use the flat iron to get rid of the &#34;bulkiness&#34; and smooth it. I think this dryer would be a great option for two of my friends who have thinner more layered hair. It would give them the curl and the volume without having to dry and then use the curling iron.	2015-08-15

Dear Poppy Austin, I have studied and analyzed Argan oil. I have come to the conclusion as many others also, that, it is one of the top organic carrier oils in the world (if it is not diluted or anything added or taken away from it) for its healing, health, and conditioning properties. There was a very prompt, noticeable, change in my facial complexion. Quite clear, smooth, and soft. Very healthy looking. Now, it has proven to be one of the best carrier oils that also promote healthy hair, as well as growth. I now use it as my main ingredient in my personal BEARD OIL. My beard is about 12 inches long now and still growing, and the Argan oil has significantly increased the health and thickness, fullness, and ultra softness of my beard. It also has added a very gleaming shine to my beard, and is very manageable now, as well as the hair on my head. Anything organic is the best, as this is how the Good Lord Jesus intended us to eat, and take care of our personal hygiene. Anyone reading this should sence this for themselves, so if you are able to, obtain this PURE ARGAN OIL, and learn how to use it for your specific needs, and you will be blessed. Thank you Poppy Austin for your truthful information and very informative and cheerful you tube on this oil. Your neighbor and friend Barry. John 3:16	2015-08-15

It is a standard eternity band lined with simulated diamonds for added class and sparkle. The banding is 360 degrees and runs the entirety of the band. The diamonds are just the right size. They add a little sparkle but not too much. It is very classy and elegant!<br /><br />I think this ring would be great for a male or female. I actually love it to stack with other rings! It is not too blingy that it demands full attention so that is why it looks great paired with another ring! I own several rings from SilverCloseout and they all look great paired with it!<br /><br />This ring comes boxed in a hard sided container and is set in black velvet for gift giving! It is truly beautiful! 5/5 stars for design, value and versatility.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

[[VIDEOID:efd2705c5e995077eefbb580810e2284]]This review is for the Sterling Silver Cz Double Zig Zag Eternity Ring.<br /><br />This ring is VERY fashionable! I have never seen a style like it! It is my favorite ring I own from SilverCloseout! The design looks even more incredible in person than in the photographs. The diamonds are two sizes. They dot the entirety of the banding and sparkle, sparkle, sparkle! I would say this ring is great for younger people as well as old! It is a very fashion forward style that looks great with all outfits!<br /><br />The inside of the banding is smooth again my skin and doesn't cause irritation. SilverCloseout uses the highest quality silver so the metals feel great all day long and never tarnish or look old. I think this ring would be a great gift for a graduate, birthday or any other occasion! It does not look &#34;romantic&#34; but more &#34;fun&#34;! It is very girly!<br /><br />This ring comes boxed in a hard sided box to keep it safe and it is great for gifting! You can wrap the box. Inside the ring is set in black velvet. 5/5 stars for value, design, and fun factor!<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

Loved the millgrain detail, it adds interest to the bracelet without being overly flourished. Others had mentioned that the hinge and clasp didn't come together well.....I didn't find this to be the case. It is well made. Mind you, it's a piece of jewelry and should be treated as such. I'm not going to give it some rough handling to see how long it takes before it to break. I opened and closed it several times to make sure everything was as it should be. It was. I had concerns that it might be too small for my 2 yr old granddaughter, so I tried it on my 3 yr old grandson(43 lbs/43&#34;) It fit him just fine with a little room to grow. I also like that it has a sliding clasp. So should it ever open by accident, it's not likely to fall off unnoticed.	2015-08-15

I plan to wear these with a simple outfit and little or no other jewelry to let the pearls shine and take center stage.  The shapes are irregular, but to me that is part of their charm.  I don't have a single complaint.  I think I will be reaching for these often...and I may be back to purchase more strands as gifts.  If you are a pearl lover, I don't think you can go wrong with these.  Highly recommended!	2015-08-15

I've only been wearing this necklace for about a week now and there has been a definite change in my pain level.

I'm not sure that the magnet is actually healing anything, but it is certainly giving me some relief, and it seems to improve everyday.

My wife wears the occasional necklace when we’re going someplace that requires us to look nicer such as going our for a nice dinner, and she and I both wear wedding bands, but beyond that we don’t really even think much about adornments like this. I have a teenage son, though, who saw this and thought he would enjoy it. So far he has been happy with it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this chain and pendant is the unique design of the pendant. It is in the shape of a bullet and has a cross on the middle of the bullet. This design makes it look fairly unique. It is also pretty heavy and the pendant is made very solid so it could be dropped from a very high distance, possibly three flights of stairs and not break or get ruined. The pendant is hollow too, so it can work as a container for holding glycerin tablets for those that need such.<br /><br />The ring that holds the pendant to the chain appears to be substantial and strong. In the even that the whole should break it seems very unlikely that the ring would be the breaking point but instead the chain would be the likely point of failure. The chain is a typical ball link chain and is not the most strong available, which means it is also the inexpensive component in this set.<br /><br />After looking over the design of the chain and pendant, I let my son try it and see how it fit him. Overall it fits pretty well, and though the chain does not have a clip, it appears to be able to fit almost anyone. (Of course, the chain could be carefully cut and a clip could be added without too much trouble.) This allows putting on this chain and pendant very easy as you do not have to hassle with a chain’s clip. It also looks nice and has a unique appearance which my son likes. The bullet is also fairly realistic looking. Overall my son is very happy with how the chain and pendant looks and how it fits him.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this chain and pendant. Though the chain is not especially strong, the design of the pendant is unique, the pendant is manufactured very well and will not break. Also this chain and pendant is easy to put on, looks nice and there is no hassle with a clip.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

I treated myself to this ring when I found it on sale and just received it yesterday.  I truly can't believe my eyes.  The yellow diamond is drop dead gorgeous!  The diamond is super brilliant, bright, shiny, well cut, well set, and it sparkles like crazy.  The photos and the video of this ring do a great disservice to the actual ring.  It is so much more beautiful in person.  Having never purchased a fancy colored diamond before, I didn't know how I would feel about a yellow diamond.  I am extremely impressed and will now be seeking other fancy colored diamonds for my collection.  I feel like the fit is perfect.  The one drawback to this ring - and it is the only reason I didn't give this ring 5 stars - is the awful quality of the side diamonds.  This ring would have been much better if they had left the four (two on each side of the band) diamonds off completely.  They are some of the worst diamonds I've ever seen - three of the four of them are white, milky little blobs with no sparkle at all, and the last of the four isn't quite as bad but it doesn't come close to matching the other three so it isn't really an improvement.

This necklace is stunning. I initially bought it to give as a gift to my mom, however I may end up having to buy another and keep this one for myself. I have seen other necklaces similar to this one and have always wanted them, but they always turn out to be of a not so great quality.  This necklace comes in a lovely burgundy pouch which gives it a higher end feel. The necklace itself is sturdy and well made. The etching on the moon and the heart is perfect. There are no misspellings or scratches. The chain is high quality. I even gave it a few good tugs and it did not break. I love that there is a mixture of silver and gold on this as it would please lovers of both types of metals.  This is a very beautiful piece and I plan on buying more as gifts for upcoming holidays!  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-15

I was more concerned with not being able to hold it before purchasing, but it feels good in the hand and serves the purpose it was created for.<br /><br />The bead count is perfect and there are other great characteristics that aren't even highlighted in the product description. At the end of the main bead (guru, mother etc) there are two cords with three tiny beads each.  These are useful if you are doing many repetitions and want to keep a further count of how many times you have made a complete circle. They slide up the cord and stay perfectly in place. Beautiful! Also, the color of the cord adds an authentic touch at a reasonable price.	2015-08-15

Okay, first things first - the product image here is deceptive due to reflections on the polished edges of the ring.  The image makes it look like the edges are silver-ish, but the ring is actually completely black.  If you want a two-tone ring, this is not for you.  If you want a black ring with polished edges and a brushed body, this is a great choice. (UPDATE: It looks like they've updated the photos to make the black edges more obvious - excellent.)<br /><br />The brushed matte black main body looks just like the picture.  I've tried both the polished black and brushed matte black versions of this ring, and they are both very comfortable - it just comes down to which look you prefer.  All surfaces and edges are smooth and slide on/off my finger just great.<br /><br />This ring has a classic shape in that it is a rounded design, much like gold wedding bands have been for many years.  I happen to prefer King Will's beveled designs that have a flatter body because I think that they look better on my hands, but this is a very nice ring if you like the classic shape but want to move away from the age-old look of gold.  I see more and more guys with black (or two-tone with black) wedding bands these days, so you don't have to feel like a total rebel getting this.  :)  For $20, it's hard to go wrong with this ring.  It's very solidly constructed, like every King Will ring that I've ever tried.<br /><br />As you likely already well know, tungsten carbide is not the same as pure tungsten. However, it is also much less expensive and has a lot of similar qualities - which is one reason why it is so popular for rings these days. What makes these rings so strong can also make them brittle, so rather than deforming like a gold band would if you hit it hard enough, these can crack. That's just a note, as you definitely don't have to baby these things.<br /><br />Pros:<br />(*) Looks mostly like the product image except that the edges are black and not silver-ish like they appear in the photo<br />(*) Comfortable with very smooth surfaces everywhere<br /><br />Cons:<br />(*) Absolutely none as long as you buy this knowing that the edges are black<br /><br />(I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.)oth surfaces everywhere  Cons: (*) Absolutely none as long as you buy this knowing that the edges are black  (I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.)	2015-08-15

This is such a good deal, don't pass it up! First of all, you get 80 different types and colors of earrings for the price of one if you bought it at a different site or in store. I was a bit skeptical about the roughness that other reviewers mentioned. But, after looking at the earrings I couldn't see anything, nor do I feel anything. These earrings are a bit less flexible than what I'm used to, that's my only complaint though. I am also wearing it in a 6 year old cartilage piercing, so I am not sure how well these would do in a fresh piercing.<br /><br />I got 20 of each bent barbell (eyebrow), 20 labrets, 20 horse shoes, 10 belly button, and 10 industrial. The industrial and belly button are the only earrings not 16G, they are 14G. Each were an assortment of colors!!<br /><br />All of the earrings came in tact, no cracks can be seen in any of the balls/cones...but honestly, if one breaks on me...I have 79 more to choose from!!<br /><br />Great purchase. I won't be needing new ones for a very long time.	2015-08-15

The bracelet has an inner diameter of 2.25&#34;, and an inner circumference of 6.5&#34;, so it's a great bracelet for a smaller wrist.  It comes in a standard paper gift box. The clasp was a little hard for me to open, but not too bad.	2015-08-15

The Rainbow&#34; Concentric Circle Women's Jewelry sets by  QIANSE JEWELRY DIRECT is a pretty cute set.I received this product within two days and well packed.The design is unique . The circular pendant isn’t attached to the little curved piece like 'C' that holds it. The side of the circular piece has little holes, which I guess I didn’t notice in the picture. The design looks like more thought was put into it than most jewelry pieces. The chain is great quality, not too heavy but not too fragile. There’s a small adjustment area at the end. The clasp is easy to get on and off by myself.The earrings are equally pretty . They can dangle and swing to the front and back The backs of the earnings have the plastic shield that is more comfortable to wear, at least in my opinion.the pendant and earing have  inlaid with a great many colored crystals which looks very nice .This set can go with any dress and great for the summer!Overall happy with the product and i will surely recommend the product to my friends and family.<br />sample provided to evaluate and provide my unbiased reviews.	2015-08-15

It is delicate and unobtrusive. Don't expect the coolaid purple-blue in the picture! Photoshop color enhancement: giving people false expectations since forever. It's more of a river blue which warms into a dusty rose color. The color vacillates between warm and cool in different lighting, always moody, defying identification. A color commitment-phobe.

I know that's sort of sudden given that we just met, but...well...this ring is awesome, and sometimes I feel silly wearing it around without actually being married.<br /><br />But I still do.  Seriously, this is one fantastic looking and comfortable ring.  Looking at the pictures here, and then after unboxing it (and these do come in a nice presentation box), I wasn't sure if I'd really like the matte finish on the center region.  It seemed kind of boring.  Yeah, I was totally wrong.  Completely, utterly wrong.  I love it.<br /><br />I feel like I'd just babble about this ring, so I'll try to simply convey that it is very comfortable and looks (IMO) even better in person once you have it on.  King Will makes several similar styles, and I've tried three of them: this one, [[ASIN:B010N8ATBS one with a stepped edge]], and [[ASIN:B010N89158 one with flatter polished strips around the matte finish]].  I like all three of them, but I'd say this one is my favorite.<br /><br />As you likely already well know, tungsten carbide is not the same as pure tungsten. However, it is also much less expensive and has a lot of similar qualities - which is one reason why it is so popular for rings these days. What makes these rings so strong can also make them brittle, so rather than deforming like a gold band would if you hit it hard enough, these can crack. That's just a note, as you definitely don't have to baby these things.<br /><br />Pros:<br />(*) Looks exactly like the product image, so if you like the pictures you should like the look of the ring in person (or, if you're like me, you'll like it more in person)<br />(*) Comfortable with smooth surfaces everywhere<br /><br />Cons:<br />(*) Might cause your eyes to burn when you, albeit innocently, startle someone by spontaneously proposing in the line at Chipotle...and they break out the pepper spray.  The silver lining, though, is that there will be tortillas all around to mop up and enjoy that spicy goodness<br /><br />(I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.)ved a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.)	2015-08-15

My lovely lady loves to wear jewelry, and what's not to love? The shine, the sparkle, the glitz -- it also makes gift-giving very easy, knowing that if it glitters, she'll probably love it. She never takes it off, except when it comes to the beach or the pool, and then she only does it reluctantly and tells me the whole time how naked she feels because she doesn't have her necklaces on. When I saw this, I thought this was a perfect glittery budget-friendly alternative to wearing her good stuff when we're enjoying the chemical-filled pool and the abrasive sandy ocean. If it gets lost or ruined, no big deal, and she still can have the security of her shiny necklaces.<br /><br />It arrived on a necklace card and wrapped in plastic so that it wouldn't be damaged in transit. The treated turquoise is really beautiful. It's a substantial piece that looks elegant (not tacky, thankfully). The earrings perfectly match the necklace. When I gave them to her, she loved it (especially that it's teal, her favourite colour, and she thought I was ridiculously romantic for the gesture). She put them on right away and they have endured most of our summer adventures. The only drawback is when she wears them for extended periods of time, the necklace leaves some discolouration. Overall, we're both happy with what we got and I've been called The Best Boyfriend, so I win too!<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for a genuine critique.	2015-08-15

My wife’s birthday is next week, but she already saw the order in Amazon.  So she couldn’t wait to try them on.  She says that the earrings fit very well and are a good size – not too big and not too small either.  She doesn’t have any other diamond jewelry, so she prizes this a lot.<br /><br />She wants a matching necklace but there is something wrong with the Amazon webpage for the earrings – 404 error that says the page doesn’t exist. I need to notify Amazon customer support because there is usually a companion necklace for diamond earrings like this.  If there is a companion necklace, I want to buy it for her birthday. And that would be a surprise.  Here is the closest necklace design that I can find that has a little gold trim in it. If anyone knows where I can get an exact match, tell me where I can find it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00XPMWBNY Sterling Silver Two-Tone Diamond Love Knot Pendant Necklace (1/4cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), 18&#34;]]	2015-08-15

The color, though, is true, and they do sparkle quite a bit. Other than not being able to see the facets, the size is okay--these are for my mother, who prefers stud-type earrings (no hoops or dangling things) so she should be really happy with them. They came in a clear zip-lock bag though, not a box, so I need to figure out how to properly present them.	2015-08-15

[[VIDEOID:43d836a9289c26817aa10fc5b9de847b]]This review is for the Sterling Silver Simulated Diamond Checker Ring.<br /><br />I love this ring! It has a LOT of sparkle! The top is checkers of sparkle and diamonds. They completely coat the top of the ring. There is a lot of drama and sparkle to this piece. It wraps around my finger perfectly to allow maximum exposure to the diamonds.<br /><br />The inside of the ring is smooth on the banding. It is very comfortable and slides on and off my finger easily. The back of the checker board pattern is open to allow light to pass through the diamonds for added effect. It is elegant, classy and beautiful. I think a male may also be okay wearing this ring! It seems sort of unisex.<br /><br />The ring comes in a hard box ready for gifting. It is presented in black velvet to keep it scratch free and dust free. The amount of silver you are getting in t<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

However, after wearing the ring 3 times, some of the stones in the channel set area (center area) started to fall out. I did not bang the ring while wearing, just normal wear. This should not happen if the stones were properly set. So I emailed the company, Jewelry Liquidation, Inc., asking if I could return the ring at my expense for repair. I never received any response from them. Obviously this is a company that only cares about making the sale and does not stand behind their product or provide any customer service.

The pearl is very large and has nice luster.  The clasp is adjustable, which is actually a feature that I do not care for but it can be nice for most people.  The only issues I have with this necklace are the pearl has a large scratch on one side, the chain was badly kinked when I took it out of the box, and the clasp looks cheaper than the rest of the necklace.  The kinks worked out once I hung the necklace and it looks very pretty on.  I paired it with some basic pearl stud earrings and a navy romper outfit and I got several compliments.  I would recommend it for the price and the size of the pearl.	2015-08-15

It is carved from one piece of stone and the surface is smooth with no flaws.  As it is made from a natural material, there is some variation in surface color, although the overwhelming majority of the bracelet was precisely what you see on the screen.  This does not appear to have been dyed in any way.<br /><br />I have quite small hands and ordered a medium.  I was able to get it on, but it was a close thing.  Because this is a rather thick, natural material, there is no &#34;give&#34; the way there would be with say, a metal bangle.  So my advice would be to order a larger bracelet than you think you need.<br /><br />This has the weight you'd expect from jade and it warms to your body temperature the way you'd expect.  Although I am not a gemologist, I have worked with beads made from some of the materials commonly used to simulate jade (dyed quartz, green serpentine, etc.), and those have a different look and feel to them.  So as far as I can tell, this is genuine.<br /><br />This is now one of the nicest items in my collection of work jewelry, and I think it could be used on a more formal occasion as well, especially if paired with pieces containing yellow gold or freshwater pearls.<br /><br />Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.	2015-08-15

It comes in a cute blue box with a little ribbon on it. The bracelet is very flexible and for being costume jewelry it's very nice and great quality for what it is. The rhinestones glisten nice when the light hits them and I believe that it is a nice piece to wear if you're going out on a date or a night out on the town with your friends. If you have a child and they want to get mommy &#34;a pretty bracelet&#34; this is a great option. It would also be a great piece for a teenager to wear with her prom dress. I chose red red one because red is one of my favorite colors  and I love real rubies. My grandmother did Avon for as long as I could remember and my favorite items were their costume jewelry, so if you are a costume jewelry lover like me this is perfect for you. These are absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.	2015-08-15

I got this for my daughter's birthday, as she'd been saying that she wanted a music-themed necklace.  It's very pretty, but the one pictured is better quality than what I got.  The soldering in person is a good bit more evident than in the image, and the silver itself isn't as smooth.  I'm considering replacing the chain because as someone else noted, it came already partially tangled and will probably continue to tangle with wear.<br /><br />Still very pretty an a lot more eye catching than most of the other musical note jewelry to be found, without being gaudy.  The polishing cloth is a small, but appreciated bonus.	2015-08-15

When I got married my ring size was a 7.  After gaining some weight, unfortunately, I now wear a size 9.  I can hardly ever find a inexpensive ring in my size.

It really sparkles and dazzles in the light.  I have had several compliments since wearing it.  It is 18k gold plated and does not rub off.  It truly is a beautiful ring and I love it.

They're very inert, and I like to sub them in for the original parlor jewelry after about 2 months because they're so small and nonirritating.  My hair doesn't get caught in them, they're comfortable to sleep in, but they're big enough not to get lodged in my ear.	2015-08-15

Traveled abroad on vacation to an island not necessarily known for being 100% safe so I didn't want to take my real diamonds. Didn't want to worry about damaging my real ring or worry about it back in the room while we were out and about. This replaced my engagement ring for the trip. Good looking, good quality (for what it is) and held up great on a vacation where we were in and out of the ocean, four-wheeling, hiking, in and out of pools and jacuzzis. Looks real, felt comfortable, very light weight, and held up great. Accurate sizing. Center stone is cushion cut, aprox 2-2.5 carats. happy with purchase, product and durability.	2015-08-15

This is a nice looking ring; however, wearing it is another issue entirely. The back of the skull/seal is hollow and for me made the ring very uncomfortable to wear. The edges are simply too sharp and almost seemed to cut into my finger. Also the hollow area trapped water and sweat causing a welt to form. If the manufacturer ever offers a solid version I would buy one in a heartbeat! For short periods, and maybe during colder seasons, this ring is great but in the south during the summer its downright painful.	2015-08-15

But I guess a flash can do that.<br />What I love and I hope you can kind of see in my picture... is that there is a beautiful deep filigree design all along the side.<br /><br />I only really took off a star because the topaz is far lighter very much making it apparent that this is costume jewelry and then the opal has far too much fire..again pushing towards the costume end of things ...but as a whole I still really like to love the piece<br /><br />If you like the picture I included, then you will love the ring ... really for the price it's wonderful .. the filigree detail surprised me and the seller really should have included a side view showing it.<br /><br />Overall...if you know what you are getting into ..I would recommend it for a great sterling silver classy costume piece	2015-08-15

They have just the delicate touch of &#34;bling&#34; that I appreciate.  The only problem is that they seem to slip away from the curve of my ear, but maybe I can find a way to secure them, or I'll just reach up and check on them frequently.  Note: They're not actually ear cuffs, more like earrings that hang up instead of down.  So pretty as they follow the curve of the ear.	2015-08-15

However I received it broken.  On the left and right side of the stainless steel engraving are two black leather bands which wrap through the engraving and then the two ends are supposed to be inserted in a circular cuff where the chain is connected to.  One of the black bands just hangs loose and you can see that it was supposed to be just cheaply glued in there.  I didn't wear my band for about a week or so and then put it on to go camping and when I came back my mom pointed out that it was broken and asked me if it was that was how it came.  It is how it came, I just hadn't noticed that both sides weren't the same.  I received a broken product from them and will update this review when I hear back from them.  I just filed a refund request so I will update to let others know how they treat their customers.	2015-08-15

It does look like the picture and looks well made but it is huge.  It reminds me of a guy's ring on my finger.  It isn't shaped at the top so it looks like a big old chunk of ring.  Don't get me wrong, I like chunky rings but this looks totally like a mans ring when in your finger.  If I was rating the make and quality alone, I would give that 5 stars as it is really well made and smooth. The amber like part is perfectly aligned with the metal.  It's a nice weight too.  Shame it isn't more feminine looking.	2015-08-15

I was really hesitant to spend this much money since the stones were not listed as CZs. Well I ordered it anyways because I just adore the design. In person you would think that the stones were CZs. This baby really sparkles!! Just what I was hoping for.<br />I have small wrists and was worried that it would be too long.  It is a nice length.  I will add the measurement later. The primary clasp is very strong and secure. However, I have to give it 4 stars since the secondary security clasps are a bit thin, arrived slightly misshapen and one did not close without my molding it. I would have gladly paid $20 more for the secondary clasps to be thicker. I have another bracelet that I paid much less for that has great security clasps that have stood the test of time. I will keep this bracelet I think or try to exchange it to see if they are all that way. There is not much point is spending this much money and not having it be secure.	2015-08-15

I thought there would be some thickness to the pendent versus just a flat piece. I agree with another reviewer regarding the chain and feel like it cheapens the look of the piece. I will be replacing it for a nicer one. I still feel the pendant alone was worth the purchase and love how it hangs.	2015-08-15

I got a little [[ASIN:B00T2TGY2S Glamulet &#34;Family Tree&#34; Charm]] to go with it, which slid on like they were made for each other (they were).  At first, it was a little hard to figure out how to open the clasp on this bracelet.  Twisting and pulling didn't work.  The charm opens up like a clam shell, so we can add more beads.  The only problem with this design is it's difficult to put on my wrist without help.  The few times I tried, my single loose bead would fall off as I'd lose my grip.  Eventually, I'd get it, but having a full strand of beads roll off like loose pearls would be a nightmare.  Fortunately, this bracelet is so loose on me, I just slide it on and off without undoing anything.<br /><br />This product was provided for review by Glamulet.	2015-08-15

Upon taking the bracelet out of the box I did notice the catch was a little loose, but it seemed to be alright if I pressed hard to ensure it was closed. It appears I was wrong, because after just one wear on a night out I realized after a couple of hours the catch must have opened and it had slipped off my wrist, very disappointed I only got to wear this bracelet on one occasion, it looked really nice.	2015-08-15

I got these in the silver color, and they came quicker than I expected.  I received them on the first day of the window I was given that it could arrive in.  The packaging was really cute, and the bag that they were in was super soft, and will be used again.  The look is very on trend right now, so I was extremely pleased with that, and they are so pretty.  The only issue I had was that the material seemed a little soft, one of the ear posts bend a little when I tried to put them on the first time, but I was able to bend the post back into shape easily and quickly.<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-15

At first I fell in love with this clicker until I had to change it for work, which is when I discovered how difficult it is to get out. I tried using my hands, pliers, other people's hands, but nothing worked until I figured out I had to carry a size 4g taper to pry it out of my nose. Now that I know how to get it out, it's not a big deal, but I did panic a little at first. Hope this helps anyone that has the same problem!	2015-08-15

I really like these earrings a lot! I opened them and put them in right away but I noticed that my ears were hurting a little bit after a while. I suspect it's due to the fact that I've not had any earrings in my piercings for a long time and the posts may have been just a bit too large to be comfortable but they're certainly cute! The size I was hoping for were the small and medium sizes, but I can see myself wearing the larger size as well.They're not heavy and being stainless steel, are hypoallergenic, so that's a relief! I did take a couple of photos, which I'll upload A.S.A.P. as well. I imagine these will be nice earrings for most people to wear on a daily basis.

It can be worn as a bracelet, belt, or multiple ways as a necklace. I purchased the dark blue and there is more blue in it than comes through in the picture which I am happy about. Great packaging. Very well presented. It came wrapped around a cushion in a box with a window. I was expecting it to maybe look more like children's jewelry but it doesn't at all. I think it looks more expensive than it is. I am still not sure how to use the waterdrop pendant clasp, but so far I am still enjoying this piece of jewelry just as it is. Also, I am enjoying the compliments I have received on it in two different outings wearing it. Definitely worth the price and would be great as a gift.	2015-08-15

The metal is highly polished, and becomes a band of pure shine when it catches the light. The rounded interior is very comfortable. It took a day for me to get used to the feeling of it on my finger (as I don't normally wear rings) but after a week of nonstop wear, I even wear it to sleep. The only reason I gave four stars was because the surface does scratch rather easily. I work in an office where the ring occasionally hits other metal surfaces, and I now notice tiny scratches all over it. However, they don't detract from the overall look of the ring, and I will continue wearing it for a long time. Very pleased with the quality and price.	2015-08-15

I sent a different ring through Amazon to my now fiancé because I was deployed overseas. I got back and bought this ring (amethyst) and proposed to her in person 2 weeks ago (31 JUL 2015).  I chose this ring because I am in the military and do not make much money and this is her birth stone.  She just came to me tonight and showed me how it is falling apart. The sides are rubbing the silver off ( the sides do not touch any skin and she takes it off to clean). I am not going to return it because it means a lot to us in what it represents. I never write reviews.  However, I don't want other individuals to have to deal with this. I added a picture but the detail is not very good.	2015-08-15
US	1844381	RCB76DIPHQPOM	B00V55C1ZG	346030911	BodyJ4You Star Nose Hoop Ring Stainless Steel 20 Gauge (0.8mm)	Jewelry	2	3	3	N	Y	Not too great.	The coloring on the photo is pretty misleading. It's mostly red and green, and way smaller than the photo, but that's common sense. It was easy to put in and went right back to shape, but the star part was a little mishapen, so it didn't fit quite as snugly against my nose as I thought it would. It is nicely made and all, but I wouldn't say it's stainless steel.. It turned the outside of my nose green after a day in the pool. Not a big deal, but it could potentially cause an infection in the long run, so I took it out. I thought about returning it, but it wasn't really worth the time or effort since it was pretty cheap to begin with. All in all, don't buy body jewelry from this seller because it's not stainless steel and it will turn your body part green. Probably wouldn't buy again.	2015-08-15

The earrings are amazing especially for the price and came a day earlier then expected. A good thing to mention is that some earrings open more then others which is not a problem since you can force them to open a little more since they feel and are sturdy earrings. I ordered the Black, Silver, Gold and Blue earrings. I gave away the silver and gold pair of earrings as a gift and stayed with the ones I really wanted which were the blue and black earrings. The color on the silver and gold earrings look better in person, but the black and blue pair of earrings were beyond my expectation. The metallic black color on the black pair of earrings and the metallic blue color on the blue pair of earrings were subtle but nonetheless stand out and give off a nice shine while in light. The only problem from my order would be that on only one side of one of the black pair of earrings the paint was smudged off in a small area and the metal silver color is showing. Other than that my experience was satisfactory and I am happy the blue pair of earrings came to me without a scratch because they were the reason I decided to purchase the earrings.	2015-08-15

The size 7 that I purchased was a pinch large for my ring finger but would have been worth re-sizing if it weren't for the stones.<br /><br />In the pictures, the stones look symmetrical and even.  The center stone looks larger than the side stones and the side stones look like they're equal in size and shape.  In person, the center stone is still larger but one side stone looked twice as thick as the other side stone.  And the cut... I wasn't expecting super fancy for the price, but I did expect that the basic cuts would at least be even.  For the most part, the top facets looked fine but each of the side ones and angled ones looked completely uneven and when you looked at the three stones from one side (no matter what angle), they were not rectangles, they weren't parallel at all - messy, lazy cuts no matter how you looked at it, and just did not flow at all with the beautifully, smooth and sleek band.<br /><br />My decision to return basically boiled down to value for the price as well as how it made me feel when I looked at it because really, it is about how you feel when you look at it, no?  I have seen cheap ten dollar rings with perfectly even cuts - not that I want to buy a ten dollar quality ring, but that I could probably find a quality silver band with some black, basic cut synthetic stones that are evenly cut for less than this band and I'd feel better about wearing it, looking at it, and not minding other people seeing it.  While I know not everyone is going to notice the unevenness of the stone sizes and cuts, I do.  I have to look at it every day.<br /><br />On the flip side, I have seen that most other reviews are from people that have purchased this as a gift or as an engagement ring.  Had this been the case for me and I did not know the cost nor foot the bill, I would be far less critical as I would be grateful for the gift. Still, the blatantly uneven stones would still probably nag at me to some degree even if I did keep silent.  I realise that this may be a personal issue/preference and some of you may not care or notice.  All I know is that I'm not totally OCD, not even close, and this bothers me enough to mention for others out there who are.<br /><br />The return was quick and hassle-free as it was a Prime purchase.  Customer service for the company was quick to write me to ask for additional info as to why I was not satisfied so I wrote basically what I wrote here but also included some additional image links for clarification as to what was so disappointing about the cuts.  I also stated, that I'd buy the ring again as I love the design if I could be guaranteed that I would receive a ring with stones that looked like the one in the picture (even with regard to cut).  Or, I would even be willing to buy a more expensive version of the same ring if the band was white gold or platinum versus silver as the design is exactly what I've been looking for.  I am pretty sure it's been well over a month now since I sent my reply to the company's question and never heard from them about whether or not alternatives are available.<br /><br />As a side note:  never brought the ring to a jeweler to have it appraised so I cannot speak for its authenticity.  Although both the stones and the band appeared to be solid, the band did not have any stamp on the inside of the ring confirming it's silver.<br /><br />I purchased this ring on May 6, 2015.  I waited over a week to give considerable thought to the ring before I decided to return it and I do not regret the return.  This original review is on Aug 15, 2015.

Received prior to original delivery date.  Great Buying Expereince!	This pendant was purchased as part of my 35th Anniversary gift for my wife.  It was delivered about one week earlier than planned (@2 weeks after order placement), and was therefore received well within the time needed.  Addtionally, the Pendant matched the weight written in the item specification, the color was very close to that of the photo, and it looked great-better than the photo.  (The photo does not adequately capture a translucent quality in portions of the Jade Rose that adds to a high quality appearance).  The chain for the necklace was very fine and lightweight, but adequate.  (Being as lightweight (as it is) could be a problem with frequent wearing for some however, this was never planned by me to be the actual chain used with the pendant).  The jewelry box & surrounding exterior container were well constructed.  Very &#34;Nice for the Price&#34;!  My bride was very pleased with this necklace and said that I should write that it is the best Jade jewelry I have ever bought her!  (Of course this is our first 35th Anniversary and is also the first time I have bought Jade jewelry for her, but ... she likes it) !!  Thank you.	2015-08-15

Unfortunately there's a minor typo in the reference and it actually says 1Tim 6:16-16.  I got it for myself though as a constant reminder of what's in those verses and that is printed correctly.  Very comfortable fit once u get the right size...I went through 2 because the first was too big and size 10 is comfortable.  A ring sizer came with my school ring and this is the right size (my school ring is also a size 10 from a jeweler and fits the same way).  It does seem a little thicker than gold but not bad if u don't wear other rings on the same hand.  It might catch on things if not sized right.  It does fit comfortably but is noticeable because it's thick.<br /><br />Oh, at work we have an XRF material analysis X-Ray machine that verified that this is 316 stainless steel which is the high grade of stainless steel.  They may have messed up the scripture reference, but this is a good quality steel that should last years and a very comfortable ring :)	2015-08-15

It is very shiny and it sparkles from all directions, especially when there is brighter light around.  It has a heavy, weighted feel to it.  It was not too uncomfortable to wear, although it feels wider on my finger than the majority of my other rings.  It also seemed to be a bit bigger and I had to reorder a smaller ring so it was not so wide and so it did not rotate around easily from the weight of it.  I recently purchased two other rings for the same finger, so I am sure the size of my finger has not changed.  It did not look too &#34;fake.&#34;  The stone has a clarity to it that made it look close to my diamond wedding set (to the natural eye anyway) and the silver was not gaudy looking at all.  Great ring for the price, especially since I normally do not like round cut diamonds at all.  Perhaps the halo look adds to my attraction to this ring.	2015-08-15

This ring is absolutely beautiful I love the way it sparkles and shines when light hits it. I got it in a size 6 and it fits my ring finger perfectly although normally I wear a five. So if you're looking to buy this ring I suggest you get it one size bigger than you normally would. It looks beautiful and you can hardly tell it's fake unless someone is going to sit there and actually examine it. It's not only beautiful but it's a good decoy ring so even if you're not in a relationship and you don't want to be bothered when you go out you can always put it on and act like you are taken you do go out. I also like to wear it if we are going out somewhere I am not for value is because my real ring is way too expensive to wear out and worry about. These are absolutely my very own honest opinion after having received and try to get this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.	2015-08-15

The twist is very feminine and works its way around the band. The diamonds are just the right amount. It is not COMPLETELY blingy but just the right amount of sparkle.<br /><br />The inside of the ring have specks of open windows to allow sparkle with the diamond flecks. The twist design is smooth on the inside so it feels good against my skin. It is very comfortable but designed well to look very elegant and classy.<br /><br />The ring comes in a nice hard box with velvet ring setting. It can be wrapped for gifting. This is a great value ring for the amount of silver you get. Everyone will love this ring! 5/5 stars for design, elegance and value.<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-15

These are vey pretty but very heavy. The dark red stones have a much deeper color than in the photos. The earrings look rich and sparkly without being gaudy. The sterling swirls on the front are adorned with the marcasite stones, while the back has a scroll design that I didn't think anyone would see. But every so often the erring would twist that other side would be visible. It makes them a little more special.<br /><br />The only drawback is that they are unexpectedly heavy for their size. I can only wear them for an evening before my lobes start to feel stretched. It is a good thing that these, for me, are more of an occasion earring then something I would wear all the time.	2015-08-15

The shoes are very light so you aren't slugging around in heavy shoes, The cushioning can't be determined just by pressing the heal, you have to try them on and feel what it's like to walk on cotton. The gel isn't a marketing gimmick - it's real. The support is wonderful. Think about buying another pair. I recently added the Asics socks with the band of elastic and heaven for my feet get's better. Also note, Footlocker San Francisco had these shoes in a different color for $160 but I ordered the color I liked for $70 less including tax (Prime so shipping was free).	2015-08-15

The shoe itself fits fine, but after 4hrs in them the design is peeling off. This is after use in dry grass for lacrosse- she wasn't even kicking a soccer ball that might have rubbed at the design. Disappointed in this design flaw that was its selling point for my daughter.	2015-08-15

Needed to add a versatile/casual boot to my wardrobe. Was going to buy from a Clarks store until I discovered the prices available on Amazon. The savings and Amazon Prime was a deal I could not refuse but still I waited. The next day was disappointed to find the product being offered at a higher price than the day before. I found a 3rd party (Right-Price) selling the boot for the same price Amazon had it for the day before but I was skeptical at first because of the horror stories I've read of 3rd party sellers. The 3rd party had great reviews (4.8/5 at the time) and was also prime eligible and so I risked it. All in all I am every happy with my purchase. Not only was I able to get the item for a great price, but I also got it tax-free and the item came in a week sooner than estimated despite being back-ordered! Great value, excellent boot, runs a little larger so may want to size half a size or a full size down. Shoutout to Right-Price!	2015-08-15

You get two sets of zippers per shoe, but honestly, you really only need one. Lace them up a little on the tight side to begin with... the zippers will fight you a bit for a while... but in the end, you'll have a set of shoes that fit your foot perfectly and are super comfortable. They will then go on / come off with practiced ease. I usually take an 11.5 (Euro 46) and the 11's in Converse fit well. Not terrific arch support with Converse, if that's a deal breaker for you.	2015-08-15

Right from when I opened the box I was disappointed, as soon as I took off the white tissue I noticed part of it was sticking to the boots.

I tried to wipe it with a damp towel and soap but no luck (touched the front of the shoe with some white paper so you can see). The only other thing is that it is very narrow around the ankle and very wide around the calves.

However the shoe felt stiff, hard on the bottom. Did not seem as flexible as I am used to. Also the toe box was a little too narrow, not comfortable for long. I do wear a 2E shoe and need a wide toe box. Also, I bought a size 7.5 as most of the shoes that I buy in an 8 are too big, (Propet's) and this was a little too short, so may be true to size in that regard. I wear an 8 in most other shoes, New Balance, Saucony etc.	2015-08-15

However, the main purpose of a purse is functionality. I need a purse with a wide opening so I can easily find what I'm looking for. I'm constantly having to remove my wallet and cell phone to get to the bottom of the purse. There is no &#34;wiggle room&#34;. Also, the strap that comes with the puri is very flimsy And is constantly wrapping itself around the purse. The shoulder strap is not wide enough to wrap completely around my arm. All in all I would not recommend this product.	2015-08-15

I initially bought 5.10 Guide Tennies, but the first pair was too big and when I went down a half size they were too small. So I jumped brands. I ordered both the Boulder X and the Mix (also La Sportiva). I was really impressed with the fit of both shoes (having European half sizes basically gives them American quarter sizes). The heel was snug and I had no slippage (something lacking in the 5.10s). The Boulder X has a lace around the heel that really snugs things up.<br /><br />My overall impression of the Boulder X was that it was rugged. It has a nice looking edging zone at the front of the toe. The lugs were nobby and looked like they would be good for hiking. There is a lot of lacing, which is both good and bad since they are a pain to get on and off but there is a lot of customization to fitting. The rubber seemed pretty sticky, picking up plenty of dog hair as I tested them out around the house. They definitely look and feel more like a hiking shoe than a climbing shoe. They are a lot stiffer and have a lot more support than a climbing shoe or more minimalist approach shoe. Just testing them out in the house I noticed they were quite warm<br /><br />While I liked the Boulder X I did end up sending them back in favor of the Mix. The Mix is much lighter and more flexible. The rubber seemed softer and stickier. The trade off is in support and durability. I feel like the Boulder would probably last longer and perform better on longer hikes. But currently most of our approaches are less than an hour, so I opted for the more comfortable of the two shoes. But if I find myself doing longer approaches the Boulder X is top on my list.	2015-08-15

I previously purchased the identical shoe in the same size, different color from a local quality store paying full price, that fit perfectly and with good arch support.  So in feeling &#34;safe&#34; that I knew my correct size and the fit of the shoe, I found this shoe online, in a beautiful color, same size and on sale.  However not only is the size too large (shoe is actually 3/8 inch longer than that I bought in store - but labeled the same size) - but also the insole is different - with zero arch support.  While I can wear my in store purchased shoes all day without a back ache, I can only wear these a couple hours before the back hurts.  If these are seconds, I wish you would label them as such.  If the shoes were not so used, I would return them.	2015-08-15

They are very soft and flexible, they feel much different than most shoes.  I thought they fit true to size (11 for me).  I like a deep arch support and with this shoe it's quite minimal; however, I usually add orthotics I just hate to give up the very soft sole.<br /><br />While the nubs that make up the sole are what attacked to this shoe it provides interesting support.  It's very flexible more so like walking in a moccasin and little arch support.  I've also tripped several times while walking in them.  After wearing them a couple weeks I'm already noticing some wear on the front of the toe even though it doesn't seem like I'm dragging them there.	2015-08-15

UPDATE: bought 2nd pair (love the breathe-ability). If you normally wear a size 11 (women) buy a 12! Fits perfect. Don't forget some shoe inserts, love them.  I usually wear a women's 11 comfortably (with a little room so my toes don't constantly hit). My toes are touching the very end on these. I would prefer to buy a half size bigger next time. The arch support is for medium arches, you might want to buy an insert if you have high arches. Other than that, these shoes are awesome! Love that they have the leather upper toe (work requirement), but, mesh on the sides for my foot to breathe. As a delivery driver, I spend over 10 hours/day in these shoes, and they are very comfortable. Will definitely buy these again.	2015-08-15

When it first arrived, it had a strong unpleasant smell that dissipated after a couple weeks--that sucked. However, after the smell disappeared I've used this bag often to add polish to my business casual wardrobe. The faux leather is pretty convincing and I always get compliments on this bag.	2015-08-15

I could tell almost immediately that I would enjoy running in these shoes. Soft enough to cushion my foot strike but not so much that I couldn't feel the road. As the run wore on the shoe nearly disappeared into the background, exactly what I look for in a good running shoe. I look forward to many more miles with these on my feet. The only thing even slightly negative I have to say about these shoes is in regards to heel striking. IF you are a heel striker these shoes could be awkward. The M strike plate positioned slightly in front of the heel makes getting from your heel to toe off difficult, or at least not as smooth as one would like. A great shoe to work on your foot striking in though!	2015-08-15

I usually wear a size 5.5 and the 6 fits perfectly after some breaking in. Don't be discouraged by a tight fit at first -- use a hair dryer to stretch the straps to the perfect fit and you'll never want to wear any other flip flops ever again. My feet are terrible -- even wearing sneakers, they'll be hurting after being on my feet for any stretch of time. I went on a trip and walked a TON in these without any pain. They're waterproof too, so perfect for the beach. Only con: when they do get wet they can make a bit of a fart noise when you walk. Still, totally worth it for the style and comfort. This is my second pair because I was afraid they'd get discontinued and want a backup pair.	2015-08-15

Comfortable compared to other brands that do the same styles (Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, Penguin).<br />I ended up buying two pairs because I like the look of these and the wear really well with tapered and skinny slim jeans.<br /><br />A bonus I found is that they are easy to clean and the white canvas and rubber rand doesn't get dirty as easily as one would think.<br /><br />My only gripe is these Avery Dash III come with the worst shoe laces ever. They are like a waxed nylon fabric, really long, thin and in a dirty white shade beige color that do not match the look and color of the shoes. I ended up getting all white cotton laces from a local shoe store and they look sharp.<br /><br />I'm also not sure why these are still selling for over $60 online when most local shops sell these between $20 and $40 on sale.<br /><br />I'm actually looking for the leather versions of these right now so I can have something for the North East Fall/Winter wardrobe.	2015-08-15

The do have a small Velcro strap but I couldn't get it to stay when I tighten them. The Velcro would just come undone and they would fit real loose again. Also there is a lot of space between my heal and back of shoe so my feet slide back and forth when I walk They are just like the pic.

I was a few days from going off on a 3-week vacation, and it was either break in a new pair of tennies or fix the old ones. The reviews of Shoe GOO, though a bit mixed, convinced me to give it a try. I was skeptical at first: the stuff is not easy to work with, and I wasn't sure I'd gotten it applied well enough. Kept the shoe clamped more than 24 hours, and when I tried it out, the sole looked to be solidly attached. Not only did the fix make it through 3-weeks in sunny Italy during which I averaged about 10,000 steps a day, but the shoe is still solid after another month of routine daily wear.	2015-08-15

Great boot!<br /><br />To start, I'll say I read some reviews and ordered a full size smaller than normal but ordered them wide. Toe box and midnfoot for perfectly. A little bit of heel slippage at first but after wearing them around for a bit with a good pair of boot socks, the fit is perfect.<br /><br />This boot looks awesome. I'm not a rider and don't work on a farm but the fall/winter I'm usually always in jeans and flannel and some sort of boot. This one is definitely my favorite. It's as comfortable as a tennis shoe and offers a lot of support and doesn't feel cheap.<br /><br />I wear boots everyday for my job and know how pricey some can get. For the money, you won't find better.	2015-08-15

I wear a fitbit constantly and I average approximately 4 miles a day walking at work.  (split approximately half and half inside and outside)  Up and down stairs and ladders, and a lot of time on knees with the toe of one shoe or the other on the ground.  I figure for about 8 1/2 months, at 5 days a week, I've literally put about 680 miles on them.  There is still nothing wrong with them, although they're beginning to show a little age.  No threads broken, nothing has come loose, and they still have the original laces in them.  The sole on them looks nearly as good as the first time I put them on. Although i'm not a hiker, or outdoorsman, I see no reason these would not do a fine job for trails or whatever.  If and when they ever wear out, i'll absolutely have to have another pair just like them, and perhaps another pair in a different color for wearing with casual attire.	2015-08-15

I've been on a search for a pair of casual sneakers that could replace my beat up Toms. At the rate Toms wear out, I knew I needed something more durable. I'm a fan of Clarks & actually saw these on QVC. $90 over there! Excellent value here on Amazon, and so comfortable right out of the box. They fit slightly more narrow than I was expecting, but nothing that effects the wearablity of the shoe. I'm not sure these will offer major arch support to someone looking for that, but a simple insert insole would do the trick! Highly recommend. Cute, comfy, quality.	2015-08-15

I would highly recommend ignoring the negative reviews on this particular boot.  Also use a bit of common sense and thinking outside of the box...something we humans tend to ignore.....Bad apples happen.  This can be applied to life in general...For instance, the growing hatred of Police Officers in our country....Bad apples....every single group of people in existence have bad apples...every single business, group, club or organization has bad apples.  The human race in its entirety....bad apples everywhere....If you apply this common sense logic to life...it...well it will be beneficial.<br /><br />4 years of service, and I still can't wrap my mind around how perfect these boots are.  If they made a non-goretex version I would also buy those, but I can honestly say, I NEVER think about my feet while wearing these.  I don't get overly hot in them, and I trust my life to these boots.  The fit is unreal, the lacing system is a tank, and the heel lock is incredible.  I have a mostly flat foot...basically extremely low arched feet, and it is a dream to wear these.  The design and build of this boot is ridiculous.  They are also extremely lightweight in my opinion.  Comfort is outstanding.  The stiff sole is great...and I can run in these easily when I need to..Tread is perfect for anything I've done and anywhere I've been...wet or dry..  The tread doesn't wear overly fast, and that is great.  Toe cap is phenomenal, could kick some teeth out if needed.  On top of that, the looks are in my book, perfect.<br /><br />It's one of those boots, that you might consider buying several pairs in the event you can't buy them years down the road...<br /><br />I have tried pretty much all of them...you name it...The drifter wins across the board.<br /><br />Hope this review helps coming from someone who exposes their boots to the most extreme environments and conditions.	2015-08-15

You can buy their equivalent at walmart and have the same outcome. Of course they work and last as just as long. I cannot remember what I paid for these but if it was more than $7 I definitely paid too much. The rubber probably cost more than the shoes were actually worth. The soles slide out. After a month or so of use, the bottom rubber started separating itself from the sock part. I stitched the foamy insole thing to the rubber from the inside trying to hold it in place (not easy as the shoe had to be turned inside out). After repeatedly stabbing myself in the finger with a leatherworking needle (normal sewing needles hate going through rubber) too many times, I reassessed the situation and came to the conclusion that the foamy insole was just going to tear anyways, so I stopped. My handiwork lasted about a week. The drawstring is great. These will be tossed after this summer in lieu of something better for next year.	2015-08-15

After wearing these sandals on average once or twice a week for 6  months, I still have the problem of the black color rubbing off onto my heels. I wear little black foot peds or whatever they are called and the black dye rubs right through. I have to really scrub my heels to get it off. And strangely, the right strap that goes over the instep is shorter than the left sandal, which is the correct length. The right I have to really tighten to keep it on. My other Naturalizers are just fine.

This is not customer friendly.<br /><br />I spent about half an hour to color the new boots. I am dissastisfied with the result. If I press the leather from the inside (sort of poking through) the light yellow shows through. Maybe If have to use even more shoe shine wax. All in all I am disappointed.	2015-08-15

I was overall extremely happy, but based on reasonable expectations. They did scrape one of my toes up. Would give 4.9 stars if it were possible, but can't give 5 when they wounded me :)<br /><br />I used to wear high shoes when I was younger, but haven't in years. Managed to wear these and dance in them with reasonable comfort for awhile, but did take them off and walk around barefoot for awhile, too. These have a wide enough heel that I felt stable and were tall enough that I didn't trip over my dress. They were white, and really cute. Therefore, they accomplished my goals. My feet did hurt a bit after awhile, and my toe hurt quite a lot (scraped a layer of skin off the top of big-toe knuckle, from one of the straps). That said, I plan to keep these shoes in my closet and wear them from time to time... Just might put a band-aid over that toe first, until they're properly worn in.<br /><br />Also, the zipper on the back of the heel was a little weird.	2015-08-15

So if you have wide feet, you have be patient for a few weeks until it breaks in. If you have regular/narrow feet, then you're okay with this point.<br /><br />SOLE: initially it was fantastic. The cushioning was amazing. However, it got compressed quickly and lost its elasticity. So after a few weeks, it was just an average OK sole just like any other unknown brand.<br /><br />DURABILITY: the upper is just fine. A few threads flying here and there, but no biggie. The problem is with the sole, which is made of soft/weak rubber. It just wears out so quickly (in addition to losing its elasticity and compress-ability as mentioned before). This wearing out of the sole made it look less than what you'd like to wear in a decent outing. So I ended up wearing this for grocery shopping or for running errands on my own.<br /><br />If these sandals had a different kind of sole, I would've bought many more. Everything else is just fine or perfect.	2015-08-15

I figured, &#34;what could go wrong, he won't fit in them next summer anyway.&#34; They arrived and were a little too snug to begin with. By the second use, the plastic ball tightener on the back broke. I had to rip that part off while at the beach because it left a jagged plastic shard and a sharp and pointed spring sticking out. The bottom of the shoe is that plastic-like material and not a rubber sole, so slipping is also a risk. Bummer.	2015-08-15

I really like them now, but the shoes weren't very comfortable at first till I did a little surgery on them. The insides of the shoes by the arches were hurting my feet, so I took a pair of scissors and I cut out the inner shoe footliner where the arches are. Then I inserted thin airsole cushions cut to the shoe size and I inserted those in the shoes and tried that on for size. Works perfect for me. If later I buy another pair of hush puppies, I'll know exactly what to do so I can have a great fitting pair of shoes. I should explain that I have always had a hard time finding the right shoes to fit my feet.. Some shoes I have to send back for a refund. Now I found some good shoes that I can wear as long as I doctor them up first. Also I'm 70 years old so maybe I won't be needing more new shoes for too much longer.

I could definitely wear these all day (and do). The velvet material is interesting. I haven't gotten them dirty to see if it's as easy to clean as the description claims. I had a hard time figuring the best size. It might run just a tiny bit narrow. I ended up going with the 7.5 size (usually I wear between 6-7) because it felt more comfortable in the width than the smaller sizes. It left a little room left but the straps help keep in on without &#34;flopping&#34;. The insole lining measures almost 10 inches long (with maybe 1/8&#34;-1/4&#34; of the heel curling up), and gets no wider than 3.25 inches.	2015-08-15

Love the soft, non-slip, cushioned foot bed and the simple yet classy design that I could wear to work but I had to return them.  As another reviewer mentioned, the sandal is entirely too long and likely very easy to trip over the extra length in the toe area.  I normally wear a size 7.5 or 8.  For this sandal, I would have gone a whole size down and exchanged for a size 7 but exchange wasn't an option for some reason. The size 8 that I originally purchased was only $21.56 prime.  I have not repurchased since the price has jumped about $10.  There is zero arch support and would not recommend these except for short walks for those in need of arch support.  I have a medium width foot (aka B-width), probably a little on the wider size even, but typically never venture into C/D width for any shoe.  Even so, the strap across the toe area is a bit loose and not adjustable.  Definitely would not recommend for people with narrow feet.	2015-08-15

I previously owned the adissage sandals, which I loved. These sandals are WAY more comfortable, but they are not to be used in water (as stated on the label). The sizes are different as well. I was a 10 with the old sandals, so I assumed that I would be a 10 in these...not the case. I had to send them back for a 9. No biggie, Amazon rocks! The bottoms are much more durable than the old adissage. These are a very hard foam, as opposed to the old, softer foam. These make great house slippers. Buy a good pair of Reef sandals for water use.	2015-08-15

I bought these for Vet Teching, which requires me to be on my feet for up to 12 hours, if not more. I chose these instead of Dansko clogs because to me, Danskos have an uncomfortable pad that pushes down on the top of my foot. I didn't have that problem with these shoes. They do take some time to break in, so be prepared for that by bringing some other shoes with you for the first couple days and switch them out. Once mine were broken in, I was able to work through the day without my feet, legs, and back aching. The only negative about this particular style of this shoe is that the &#34;scales&#34; of the snakeskin pattern started to flake off after a few months of consistent wear. But besides that, these shoes lasted me a good 8 months of working 5 days a week for 10 - 12 hour shifts!	2015-08-15

I bought these because I wanted a pair of sunglasses that would fit over my prescription glasses but not make me look dorky. I bought these instead of clip-on sunglasses because I mow lawns for a grounds company, and was hoping that these glasses would keep stuff out of my eyes and from scratching my prescription glasses. They do, mostly. because of the shape of the frame of the Cocoons and the shape of my face, I occasionally (about 5 times a day) get some flying grass/rocks/trimmer line between the lower right and left corner of the Cocoons and my face. Not a big deal, because before I bought these, I used an old pair of glasses (different prescription, thus poorer vision) that was scratched and pitted. Now, I can wear my daily glasses, and don't worry about scratching them up. In addition, these make trimming along bright white objects (concrete driveways, white siding, etc.) much easier, as I am not squinting. I like the Flex-2Fit temples- they can be adjusted to make the fit tighter or looser. I usually straighten the temples and bend them in toward my headThey are also great for driving as they cut the sun's glare, etc.<br />Overall, these were a great investment. I hope they last. Just beware, these may not fit snugly against the front of your face like some sunglasses would.	2015-08-15

Update 2:  Actually the 14 4E were slight too big - I got some blisters because of them being loose. I 14 2E would be a better fit for the 13 $E. What interesting is that the shoe fitting tool says they'd both fit *perfectly*.   Buying shoes online is still hard. ---   Update: Amazon has introduced a new way to see if 1 pair of shoes compares against another pair.  So I entered that I had the MT910v1s and wore them in 13 4E and they fit perfectly and Amazon recommended (with a fancy 3d graphic) that the V2 size would be 14 4e.  Well I took a chance and ordered a pair and guess what -- they fit perfectly. Amazon gets a GOOD JOB from me.  New Balance gets a SHAME ON YOU for wildly mis-sizing the V2 or these shoes.  -------------  I was thrilled hearing that New Balance was making an updated version of the 910s, I still have my original pair (worn out but good for the beach) and would have re-purchased the v1s again if they were available.  The bad news about the v2's is that the toe box area seemed significantly smaller and my big toe and the toe next to it hit the edge of shoe while walking, making it a very uncomfortable shoe.  I experienced the same issue with there 1069s and it caused me to have x-rays done to determine if I had broken a toe  (I didn't.)  I returned them without trying a larger size because they stop offering .5 increments at 13 4E.  I hope new Balance starts sizing their shoes correctly. I'd expect a v1 and v2 to offer the same toe box space.  I gave them 2 starts because the black and orange coloring looks really good.	2015-08-15

They felt like bedroom slippers and the fit was perfect.  I honestly didn't put a lot of faith in the performance but I have been surprised!  I am a nurse of 35 years and still on my feet a lot daily.  I wore these to work, taking a back up pair of shoes, totally expecting to start having discomfort after a couple of hours.  I wore them all day and honestly they literally put a spring in my step.  I have worn them several days since then and at the end of the day, they are still feeling good and my feet do NOT hurt.  I have a narrow foot and often walking shoes slide at my heel.  These fit nice.  They are unbelievably light weight and nice appearing shoes.  You do feel support and again, like a spring is in your step.  I am already looking for another pair so I can have one pair for work and one for other times.	2015-08-15

They do, from a wide width &#34;D&#34; to wider.  Should these stretch or loosen-up in some way with wear, I will have to trash them.  If you have a &#34;C&#34; width, and especially if you have a narrow &#34;B&#34; width foot, these will NOT fit.  You will step right out of them (plus they will look goofy on you).

US	52454602	RSIEBTYSBVZ2E	B00O8FZU2Q	934875468	ECCO Men's Findlay Tie Oxford	Shoes	5	2	2	N	N	Great, stylish shoes	I bought my first pair of Ecco Findlay's through Nordstrom, but I came here to buy another pair. I think the problem people are having with this style being &#34;too big&#34; is that recent shoe fashion is for a longer silhouette and toe area. A year ago, I bought a pair of trendy shoes from another manufacturer, and they definitely seemed too long. At first, I was tripping over myself going up stairs. I think ecco is trying to be a bit more trendy, and branching out from  their great ,but spectacularly ugly classics like the Trak hiking, or the BOM. Ecco shoppers aren't usually young fashionistas, but the fact is that this kind of simple, classic shoe is very much in fashion right now. I live in a hip west coast city, and I want to look &#34;on point&#34;, but be able to walk all day. This is the shoe.<br />  Finally, I have a very similar pair of eccos from 2012. They are incredibly comfortable. I was wearing them almost every day for three years, and there is NO sign of wear on the soles or heels. They will go on for ever. The top leather is worn and stained, but that's because I often hike on rocky, wet trails wearing these oxfords! Ecco are fantastic shoes for anyone with foot problems.	2015-08-15

I gave these three stars because they are just okay for water aerobics.  A little slippery, not the greatest grip. The big problem is that one side of the strap on the left shoe came off the first 5 minutes in the water, 15 minutes later the second side detached.  25 minutes later, the right shoe was without a strap.  Luckily the shoes stayed on without the straps.  The feel like a less expensive Crocs type shoe when on. Good for the shower and locker room. Let me add that the shoes were roomy enough for my feet and I did not pull the straps tight. I just attached them to the velcro without pulling on them.	2015-08-15

In addition, these shoes were a little snug.  Other factors that affected my decision to return them:  1) the toe is so round as to make the foot look wide and clunky from above and 2) the heel is too low for my preference.  A little more wedge (maybe another inch) would have been great. I have been looking everywhere for tan/cognac shoes with a 1-1.5 inch heel to wear professionally with slacks or with tights and a jeans skirt.

Pros.....<br />-Very comfortable after a three week break in period. I can wear them for 8-10 hrs a day no prob(other than the squeaking)<br />-Quality seems unsurpassed upon<br />unboxing.<br />-Seem to be waterproof from the water I have had sprayed/splashed on them.<br /><br />Cons.....<br />-These suckers squeak like no other!!! Sounds like I'm waking in plastic shoes all the time, which surprises me because the quality of materials seem to be excellent.<br />- maybe breathable, but my feet seem to get rather hot in them, but not wet. (I don't have real sweaty feet though)<br />- soul seems to be a little too soft. I have worn them every day for 8-10 hours a day outside, and they have some pretty good size chunks out of the soul like when you rip a pencil eraser,(see the picture by my thumb and finger) and all I've done is walk on concrete, street, and some occasional gravel/rocks. Don't see the soul lasting too long.<br />-price seems to be a bit high for the time period I foresee them lasting.<br /><br />Overall I would prob buy another pair depending on how long these last.  &#34;If&#34; I get a year out of them, they will prob be worth the money.( but what I see in three weeks with the soul, it'll be a push to make it a year I think). When I first inboxes them I thought they would last 5 years or so.	2015-08-15

I wear them almost daily. Sometimes they are more comfortable than a pair of sneakers. Inner sole is decent, but I replaced them with aftermarket ones. Not Gel inserts, which I think is more of a marketing success than real foot comfort. Inner soles don't need to be super soft - they need to be supportive. They look good with khaki work pants or with jeans. They get a little hot in the summer, but it's black leather, what can you expect? It's physics. I've got some complements on the looks and only on the longest days do my feet feel tired or ache. They can be a bit uncomfortable when climbing a steep incline, but they are not hiking boots.  They are good for walking around, standing on flat surfaces, and offer good support when standing on a ladder (which is a big reason to wear boots in my opinion). The soles squeak a little on some surfaces, (waxed linoleum) which is annoying and makes it difficult to sneak into work if you are running a couple of minutes late. They keep you honest.	2015-08-15

They just don't hold up. After a month or two, I tossed them because I was too embarrassed to let my son wear them they looked so bad.

I have them in my running and trail shoes as does my wife.<br /><br />To heat mold my second pair, I put a board over the toe portion of the insert to keep it flat because I do not like the feeling of having something holding my toes in the shoe.<br /><br />The fit is true to size and I did not need to trim any of the inserts. My wife uses them in a women's size 9 Merrill hiking shoe and whatever running shoe she wears (too lazy to go look at the moment ;). I use them in my La Sportiva Bushido and New Balance 1080; both men's size 11.<br /><br />I would love to see an option with just a bit more cushion under the ball of my foot, but these are easily the best inserts I have ever used.	2015-08-15

I ordered the ELSA-BLACK-PU in size 11 but got regular ELSA-BLACK heels in size 11 which is confusing as it didn't even say size 11 was an option for that style when I was making the purchase. (still isn't an option now) I wanted the leather version, but these will do I suppose. I normally wear size 9 shoes and size 10 heels, but I the size 11 of these fit me with just a tad bit of extra room. Chose the 11 vs 10 based on other reviews on here saying to order a 1/2 size up and 10 1/2 wasn't an option. It's fine though, I prefer the extra room as it enabled me to put some (much needed) heel liners in there.	2015-08-15

The free return was great! The 11's were perfect and fit like a glove from day one. The leather was buttery soft and comfy too. I have a wide foot and bunions so it's nice to find a shoe that works well with my foot issues. I also require good arch support and these have that as well. These sandals are a little bit firmer in the sole  than some of their thong sandals that have a solid black sole, but I can feel them getting softer and forming to my foot with each outing. I purchased the tan color. I like that they have a unique look to them and that they match lots of things. I feel they are very durable as well. I'm glad I found them : )	2015-08-15

It's canvas, not leather, but it's a perfect around the town, everyday kind of bag, large enough to carry a tablet and slide pockets that are the perfect size to hold your smartphone and other vitals. The orange color is just out of this world, to die for.  It's a cool orange and is just really pretty out in the sunlight.  It doesn't look cheap or too hot.  I love all the pockets which are made excellently (perfect in my opinion as far as having everything 'fit' nicely - so it meets its function to a perfect fit).  I thought I would not like the writing on it, but it doesn't bother me and it's just a nice little added touch.  It's not gaudy and so visible that it would be distracting; just the opposite.  I love this bag and it, too has another strap that comes with it to use as a longer shoulder bag.	2015-08-15

I recently started taking pilates and needed socks with a grip to use for the classes. I bought a pair that was sold at my Pilates studio that was from the brand Toe Sox. They were extremely expensive (almost $20 for one pair)! Since then I've tried to find cheaper options for socks. I recently purchased from Walmart a cheap pair for about $7 and they were horrible. I thought I'd have to buy more expensive socks until I found this pair on Amazon! The Baleaf socks are affordable and offer the same type if grip protection my expensive Toe Sox brand had. I'm a size 6 in shoes and bought a small and they fit perfectly fine on me. They also are aesthetically pleasing. I bought the black pair, and a pink pair- they were true to color. A great pair of socks, I'd recommend them to a friend to buy!	2015-08-15

I love the simple design and the gold buckles are a nice touch to an otherwise plain black bag. The leather is very soft but also thick and durable and there are pockets on the inside, the back and the front. the size is great because it's not the size of a full backpack but not super mini either. I've actually been looking at bags for months now, considering the design, material, size and prize and I'm happy I chose this in the end. +1 for bags that are simple, and clean looking.

They're so cute with the polka dots. To call them running shoes is a bit of a stretch. Like others have mentioned, the toe box on these shoes are very wide and that's saying a lot because I have wide feet. My feet shift around a lot in them while I'm walking. I wear an 8 in all of my running shoes and I could've easily purchased a 7-1/2 because these fit so loose.They're comfortable but not as supportive in the front of the shoe as I was hoping. For the price, though, I'll add some shoe inserts and be happy with them as a walking/casual athletic shoe. This is my first Adidas shoe purchase so I didn't know what to expect. For casual use, I like them a lot. They're really cute. However, if you're looking for a more supportive running athletic shoe, these are not for you.	2015-08-15

I had to return the 7s because they were too narrow. I then got them in an 8 and they fit, but I still cannot just slide my foot in - I have to pull on the straps to get my foot all the way in. This is not so much because they are narrow, but more from the material they are made from. The part your foot rests on is soooo comfy - it's squishy and cushions my foot so well.

My first purchase of the Aviator ($12.95) was when I was in the U.S. Air Force 1962.  Since I out grew them (52mm), last year a second pair of (55mm) Aviators was purchased for considerably more; and a third pair with clear lenses installed was just recently bought from Amazon.  The quality, fit (no indentation around each ear from the wraparounds) and finish are still there.

I put about 10 miles on them prior to the trip to break them in.<br /><br />We got stranded on the island due to ferry trouble and ended up being there for eight days. We did about 50 miles on extremely technical trails with full packs (45 lbs, in my case).<br /><br />On smooth rocks the size of a house, often tilted as much as a 45 degree angle that you had to walk along: flawless grip and good ankle support on the angle. Feet stayed put very well side-to-side, slight movement inside the boot when going down the rock face.<br /><br />On trails FILLED with basketball-sized rocks that you had to walk on for miles, or solid roots for miles: flawless grip, not one slip until it rained, then less traction on the wet rocks, but not one turned ankle.<br /><br />On stairstep inclines or very steep solid rock inclines: This is where the boot proved to be the perfect Isle Royale piece of gear. The toe of the boots grabbed the rock tightly and the stiffness of the sole made it easy, safe, and comfortable to push hard as you climbed.<br /><br />On the few level, dirt trails: seemed to be a bit heavy and stiff-soled.<br /><br />No blisters, though by day eight, I started to have some of my big-toe callouses get hot.<br /><br />The fit is great for my size 41.5, standard-shaped feet.<br /><br />The materials and workmanship are the highest quality.<br /><br />The only downside is that the weight and the stiffness of the sole/ankle support make them a bit too much for daily hikes or where the terrain is civilized. These are big, heavy boots, ideal for technical trails with a heavy pack where you can't afford any kind of injury. Today, they fit like slippers and I wear them for all my packing.	2015-08-15

Not to mention, the price was a steal! $50 less than in stores. SUPER happy!	2015-08-15

You feel like you're walking on pillows and these sandals are no different HOWEVER the back of the sandal rubbed the back of my heel raw within minutes of wearing them around the house.  Back they went.  How disappointing because they really looked cute.  Note: Naturalizer sizing is not consistent.  I can wear either a 7.5 or 8 depending; I consider myself a 7.5.  I ordered these in an 8 but probably could have worn the 7.5.	2015-08-15

Fit 2 sizes up, so I had to send those back for exchange, still look somewhat big. Straps are uneven, their length and position is different on left and right of my pair.

Though they're casual enough for every day, I received a number of compliments on their looks, too. Excellent arch support. Comfortable for someone with midfoot comfort issues.	2015-08-15

I don't typically run into that problem with shoes, so I was a little surprised to find myself hunting around for the thickest possible trouser socks so that I would be able to keep the shoes on.  However, they are attractive and otherwise comfortable shoes, so hopefully some sort of sole insert will take care of the problem.  The company definitely seems to make wider than usual shoes, as I bought a pair of their booties last winter, and they were a little wider than they needed to be too, although loose shoes are less of a challenge to deal with in a bootie.  Overall, I like the shoes but I would prefer a more standard fit.	2015-08-15

The heel is perfect and you feel as though you can run, jump and skip in them. But alas after about 2hrs I started to feel as if my feet were dying (I sit a lot and I'm usually in front of a camera) they ached and I could not determine the specific irritant, I could not point out the point of acute discomfort.  There was a gradual intensification of the general discomfort which to this day I cannot point to its origins.My feet rejected this shoe.emphatically and when I see them I become angry. I love love love nine west....these were a sad mistake. What makes it worse is the little ankle strap..... this made it impossible for me to slip them off unobtrusively when the discomfort reached unbearable levels. You may have a better outcome , but I've given you fair warning...DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES they have been sent from an alien planet to cripple female earthlings.	2015-08-15

I've been purchasing Justins JMax boots annually for the last 4 or 5 years. My only complaint is they only last 12 months before the leather cracks and holes start appearing. I religiously use 100% pure neatsfoot oil or Obernauf's on boots. I'm beginning to think oiling these boots makes little difference in their life. They are kept clean, seldom see rough terrain and are mostly used on our farm. 50 years ago I was a lot harder on boots and could easily get 2 years life out of them. Is Justin using inferior cheap leather?	2015-08-15

Love the brand, these shoes have a stiff leather compared to other shoes purchased of the same brand.

However, with Maddens products, dont expect longevity like a real pair of leather boots. These are perty boy boots, its as if rich kids buy them to wear for a few nights out and then get a new pair next week. meant to last a season or two and you chuck them, not even worth re soling, crappy fake materials, the urithane on the soles will wear fairly fast. My suggestion, invest in some real leather boots, they have pairs around 150, and you can get them re soled for like 50.00.	2015-08-15

They moved inside easily. They kept looking nice despite the abuse I subjected them to. I can't wear many boots due to my good German heritage and wide calves, so it was nice to have a boot to go with slacks, also.

Really broke them in during my Euro trip on those cobble sidewalks and streets. They remain comfortable all day and feel very light. They have a thinner feel than the previous drift cat5 model, but have been pretty durable. I've done anything from running, driving, bike rides, casual events, standing in long queues at the shops, and taking fairly extensive walks.

I was introduced to these full length sport supports at a local sporting goods store a few years back, and was very impressed by the firmness yet flexible insoles.  The instructions recommend putting these in the oven (I know, right?!) at a low temp for 10 min, then once out of the oven, for you to place your feet onto the insoles so they will conform to the exact match of each foot. I did this once to try it out, but have since just put them out of the package into my athletic shoes (Saucony, Asics) and even my Converse, which if you wear them, know there is absolutely no arch support in any of them.  It does take s little while to get used to them as they are stiffer than the gel/foam inserts but I no longer get achy arches/feet.  And yes, pricey but for my foot health, worth it...plus Amazon offers it at a better price than specialized shoe stores.  I also wear Birkenstocks on my non gym/sneaker days.  Very happy!	2015-08-15

I was a bit hesitant of the &#34;gold accent studs&#34; thinking it might be too ostentatious, I was wrong, it actually adds a bit of &#34;umph&#34; to the style.<br />Arch support might be a problem for certain flat footed but was fine for me walking all day in Disneyland.  I might add a little arch support just cuz...<br /><br />I received a handful of compliments about the shoe and a few admirable stares...at least I think they were...so for me, that's a validation that it was a good/right buy.	2015-08-15

Mine have lasted 20 months of near daily use!	First of all, let me preface this review by saying, I am a Chef in a commercial kitchen and these shoes slip-resistant sole works well in a wet an oily environment. I purchased them in December of 2013 and they have been worn 6 days a week every week since. They were a bit tight and stiff at first (bought a 12R) but were broken in in no time at all. They have served me well and they are about $10.00 cheaper now than when I first purchased them.They are advertised as having leather uppers; if that is so, then there is a very thin veneer of leather over something else. Having said that, I need to replace them because the shoe uppers are now cracked and peeling and allow my feet to get wet. Not a pleasant experience...blisters tend to develop in a wet environment, even if I powder my feet. If you are not in a wet and greasy environment all day, these shoes will definitely do what you need them to do! Even if you work in a damp/greasy kitchen, you can't go wrong for $40.00.	2015-08-15

They are almost like shoes so can be worn anytime of the day without their looking like typical slippers.<br /><br />Negatives:  The first pair I received, after a few weeks, the insoles came unglued.  I had them replaced and put insoles inside to protect them from this happening again.  Also, this will keep them clean inside since there is no way to wash them.<br /><br />The soles are very slippery, and I slid down a carpeted stairs.  Ouch!  I just purched skid-proof outer soles to prevent this from happening.<br /><br />So, without the fix-ups mentioned, I would rate these slippers a ZERO.  But with the problems corrected, they are GREAT!	2015-08-15

I love the color, the size is perfect and the style is spot on.  Two problems - the smell is atrocious. It's a chemical/dye/I don't even know what smell, that can take over a whole small room.  I was hoping it would go away, but no luck yet.  In between uses I've been hanging it outside to air, which helps a little temporarily.  Also, the first time I wore it with dark colored jeans, they stained the back side of the bag.  It wasn't just dye transfer, it's as if the color on the bag was rubbed off a little as well.  Very disappointing.  I've bought a few HOBO bags in the past and have been very happy.  The quality of this one is a let down.  If I didn't like the color so much, and I wasn't so lazy, I would have sent it back.	2015-08-15

I have always heard great things about Birkenstocks, and while I don't necessarily find the Arizona style to be ugly, they aren't very &#34;me.&#34; However, after working in retail for the past couple of years, as well as walking around campus in some less-than-supportive shoes, I have started to develop plantar fasciitis and I knew I needed some sandals that would actually benefit my foot, since my summer shoe selection is pretty pitiful. These are perfect! The antique lace color is really nice (it's kind of like a slightly shimmery off-white color) and the style is more feminine than I thought which is a plus, and after the break in period when the shoe has completely molded to your foot (which for me was only a couple days of wearing them a bit, and no blisters or anything like that), they have become one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've ever worn. I'll be sad when the weather gets cold and I can't wear them anymore!<br /><br />They definitely run a bit big, I'm a very true size 9 and the 39 fits me really well. As far as the width, I got them in a regular because that's the only width I could find anything in. My feet are on the narrower side of medium and while I think a narrow size would be a bit better, the regular width lets my feet spread out and I don't find it uncomfortable at all. These don't seem to run quite as wide as some of the other styles I've seen.	2015-08-15

The color I got (Surf Petrol) is just as shown, a deep teal color. I think they look great and feel great too -- though definitely more of a fall/winter shoe, as the material is pretty thick and warm.

I have another pair of &#34;Career&#34;-branded Sketchers in light gray that I love to wear to work when it's warm, but I wanted another color of &#34;summer office shoes&#34;. The pair I have are size 6 and fit perfectly. Of these, I ordered a 6 in black and a 7 in brown just in case (and because of the price differences). I was very disappointed that the 6 was just a little too small. It definitely rubbed against the back of my heels. Placing it against the pair I already have, there was indeed a small but noticeable difference in the sizing. The 7, of course, was too big. Otherwise they were cute and comfy-looking. If they had fit they would have been just what I was looking for as far as style and comfort.	2015-08-15

Also I'd hoped they'd help with my issue of &#34;falling&#34; off the side of my flip-flops... But I've still managed to fall off the side of these too a few times. Probably user-error.

I'm on my feet all day at work, so I HAVE to have good shoes.  They do fit a little tightly with socks, so I'm guessing they are designed to wear without socks.  They feel so good, it's almost like wearing slippers.  The upper is a little loose-fitting and overly stretchy, which makes them good for people with wider feet, but they feel like they're lacking a little support.  I like the memory foam insoles in my other Skechers better than the foam insoles in these shoes, but they still feel good.  They also don't look like tennis-shoes or athletic shoes.  There could be a little more arch support, as well.	2015-08-15

I bought these for my daughter before we went on a 10 day vacation to a cabin the mountains. She absolutely loves them!<br /><br />*SIZE: They fit really well. I'm learning that there is a huge range within sizes for toddler shoes. For example, her foot measurement indicates a size 8 and she has shoes that are sizes 7,8,  and 9. Some of her 8s probably won't fit for another year. These shoes were true to size!<br /><br />*TRACTION: They have great traction for hiking, playing in the dirt, or running in  circles.<br /><br />*BREATHABILITY: They are breathable so her feet aren't enclosed and sweaty.<br /><br />*VERSATILITY: They're great for playing in the water...walking through a river, riding in a boat or on a jet ski, etc., and quickly switch to great shoes on land.<br /><br />*COLOR:The color isn't great, but it's neutral so it doesn't attract a lot of attention.<br /><br />GREAT PURCHASE!	2015-08-15

I have had this pair for several months and they seem to be in good shape, but my last pair started coming apart at the seams  made the last longer with some shoe goo. I have heard UA is improving them. If your feet get hot easily and you want a comfortable pair, these boots are for you. I'll buy another pair when these fall apart.	2015-08-15

First I loved them from afar and would buy the wannabe off-brands from Payless and Target when the real thing was too expensive. When I finally brought myself to pay up for a pair of true lime green Keds a decade or so ago, I wore them for years until no wash could resurrect them from their new grayish-pistachio color, and even then, holes in the canvas were the first decay—a tolerable decay. I love the style with everything, they come in my hard-to-find wide size, and, most importantly, they lasted.<br /><br />But this time, like others have reported, the rubber outer around the sole started pulling away within a month tops. I probably do more walking than most people, but when I got my previous pair of Champions a couple years ago, this wasn't a problem, and I was walking and wearing them more than I am now. Back then, the sole wore down smooth and just thinned out over time. This pair, though, the sides are pulling away from the insole, the whole bottom sole is popping out from the bottom, and I could flip the rubber outer up and put my finger between the two. They're actually falling apart. They're exploding unwearably. There's no point to spending this much money on the real thing anymore when the off-brands last at least as long.<br /><br />I'm pretty bummed out. I've really tried to make this last an excusable lifespan with some shoe glue, but I shouldn't have to do that after just a couple months.	2015-08-15

NEW REVELATION; These boots lasted only a few months when I noticed holes forming on BOTH boots. I called Danner to complain and was told to return them for warranty exchange(at my expense). I did get another pair as a warranty exchange. But they did not come from Danner Boot co. they came from LaCrosse Footwear outlet. When I called to register the new pair for warranty , I was told there was no warranty on the new pair. It did not take long to figure out why. The replacements were at best factory seconds(or worse). The eyelets were at different heights from side to side and the inner lining was loosely stitched into the boots which caused wrinkles which in turn caused a very uncomfortable boot when laced up.  These boots cost WAY TO MUCH to get this in return.. I could have gone to Wallmart if I wanted cheaply made boots. At least they would have kept replacing crappy boots until there was satisfaction. This is in no way a reflection on Amazon. I really expected a MUCH better product from Danner.Boots.     Buy these at your own risk.	2015-08-15

(I put on my thickest socks and they were still huge.) I'm used to Keen's variance and was trying to be careful (I have Keens that range from 6.5 to 7.5 that fit the same) but was still surprised at these.<br /><br />If we leave aside the problem of sizing, they're cute and comfortable, although they feel cheaper compared to other Keens I own (and I own a lot of Keens); they are vegan (which isn't ordinarily an issue; I don't want to think about how many cute fabric vegan Keen shoes I have in my closet...it's a lot) but they feel flimsier than the standard Harvest Mary Jane style. Whether the fact the sole is softer and more flexible is an advantage or not is a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />Although this doesn't impact my rating, given the third-party seller's return policy, returning them will cost about 1/3 of the price of the shoes themselves--so I'm going to be waiting for my daughter to catch up in a year or two and keep my fingers crossed she still thinks they're &#34;So cute, Mom!&#34; then.

I bought the mediums, 9 pairs actually, for my Lucchese Boot collection, my boots are 8.5D and these fit perfectly. These are a must have for high end western style boots. Keeps the sole flat and the instep high. These also fit the width good too, just enough to maintain the boots shape and size while stored. I have tried numerous kinds and these are the best value I have found thus far. Problem I always had was the heel would always pop loose or rise up rendering the spring tension useless. The Woodlore boot tree always stays locked in the heel of the boot and does it job. I suspect these will last a lifetime in each pair of my boots, and at a reasonable cost with free shipping. These are a must have if you own western style boots of any kind	2015-08-15

Stylish bag, 2 independent zippered main pockets in the middle. Front zipper pockets are substantial in size, the back zipper pocket is ample and of course the much needed interior &#34;secret zipper pouch&#34; is a good size.  The zippers flow easily but not so easy they just open on their own. The bags shoulder strap is wide and feels good on my shoulder, have had it for a month or so and use it daily and never have had any slippage. Haven't used the attachable strap but do keep it in the purse. I have minimal stuff in the back now, it hangs nicely. My bags are like a tide, my family fills it up on the weekends when we are together then on the weekdays its emptier in the absence of my family. This bag can handle it and with fashion!  This is a great bag for being organized but yet fashionable. I like the security that the zippers provide verses an open top bag for pick pocketers to improve their skills with. Quality material with no smell(??). Take a chance and get it!	2015-08-15

These have a nice round toe and do accommodate a larger calf, especially with the full-length zippers. I love the Teak color (it's exactly the same as other Bed Stu teak boots) and the distressed leather. They are unfinished on the inside, but after the initial wear off of the raw leather, they will stop leaving leather &#34;lint&#34; on your dark denim and tights. I ended up returning these because I wasn't a fan of the bulge of leather created at the top of the shaft due to the nature of how the double zipper gusset folds. I wish this wasn't the case because I love these boots and wanted them in my collection of Bed Stu footwear. I will look at other styles instead since my other pairs are really comfortable once broken in.	2015-08-15

Very disappointed that the shoes become very slippery when the bottom is wet.  After all, this is a water shoe!

Wrote to them about it and they sent me another pair.<br />Same thing, just as slippery when wet as the first pair so I think it must be the design or material used in the shoe.<br />I did not get any better &#34;feel&#34; of what I am stepping on as the shoe is suppose to provide.<br />Would not recommend this even if you use it in dry situations as the first exposure to wet will cause a fall for you.	2015-08-15

Based on the other reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I bought a half size smaller than usual based on reviews, and that was a good thing.  I typically wear an 8 and have a medium width foot with a slightly high arch.  I love these sandals!  They're not too big, in fact I could adjust straps even more and they'd be a bit tight.  They look even better than I expected, and seem well made.  I love KEEN and almost always have success with KEENs.  These are heavier than the sandals with a really flexible sole, but a bit lighter than the more heavy duty ones with a lot more strap construction on top.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the chemically smell out of the box - though it does dissipate in a few days - and the grooved designs in the sole are a little uncomfortable if I have been standing for a while.  Otherwise, they're a win.	2015-08-15

These are a little flimsy compared to issue boots.  They quit putting in a lot of tread in the center of the boot so they are thin in the center where the steel shank is supposed to be.<br /><br /> To make these usable,<br />1.  Put on 72 inch  laces so you can let the seam in or out as needed without unlacing the boot each time you take it on or off.<br />2.  Put in some jell soles in them  and on top of the jell soles a standard insert or arch support.<br />3.  Cover the leather in oil or saddle soap so that the leather becomes flexible.<br />4.  BREAK THEM IN by wearing them awhile each day until they conform to your feet.<br />  Overall they cut some corners in building these, but for the price they work ok.	2015-08-15

Came in her specific size, and 2.

Bought a pair for me to replace a pair I'm still wearing but look worn (I've worn them for four years). Also bought a pair for hubs. Sperry's are always a little snug in the toe box upon first wearing, but stretch after that until the shape of the the leather conforms to your feet! Don't keep these if they cause discomfort upon first wearing, though. Color is pretty true to my PC screen,(a nice neutral navy) but the leather has a somewhat grainy appearance to be fashion forward, I suppose. It seems that scratches & marks don't show as much. My Go-To shoe for casual occasions! Comfort is unbelievable.	2015-08-15

I also typically need larger sunglasses.  I returned a pair or 52mm aviators in the past in exchange for 57mm pair.  So, I thought the 54mm size Wayfarers would be right for me.  Well, 54mm is big!  They are right on the cusp of being too big for me.  I kind of wish I went with the 50mm.  So, if you are thinking about the 54mm, be sure you really have a larger face or just truly prefer a larger frame because these are big in my opinion.<br /><br />I should have gone to a store to try them on first.  Everything else is great.  Quality is superb.  I wore many pairs of Oakley in my younger years.  These Ray Bans feel just as good or better in terms of precision and quality.  Metal frame inside the plastic, high quality lenses, hinges super strong, solid coloring rather than paint.	2015-08-15

Had a pair of Reebok Power Lifts but someone stole them from my desk at work.  I bought these as a cheaper replacement and just keep them in my gym bag to prevent them from being stolen.  The toe box on these shoes is fairly wide so they feel like clown shoes.  The high tops keep my heel in the back of the shoe where it's supposed to be but also allows flex in the ankle.  The shoe provides a flat platform to squat and deadlift in and prevents your body weight from being shifted forward.  Shoe has some breathability so foot sweat isn't that big of an issue when lifting but I also haven't used these for any sort of gym classes.<br /><br />I'd recommend them as a good starting point for folks looking for lifting shoes.	2015-08-15

Regular care will extend their life.  I am very hard on my boots and cow manure is tough on leather (makes me wonder why cattle don't have their butts fall off).  The size was a good fit and consistent with what I purchased in the past.  I buy a wide width and they can't be found in stores.	2015-08-15

Great value for the money	I needed a new small black purse to replace my expensive Tignanello purse that broke. I wanted a small cross body purse to hold my phone, credit cards & cash, car keys, cosmetics pouch, glasses case but  I didn't want to pay a lot like I had before. Spent the money but the strap broke anyway.  I usually don't write product reviews but after already buying and returning 3 purses before I found this one I felt I could help someone else save some time by letting them know this one was great. In fact it's perfect.  I really appreciate that it is roomy enough to hold everything I need while still being compact. It is leather and isn't smelly like some of the other purses I read about.  The only improvement I would make is to add internal slots for credit cards so there is no need to carry a small wallet but I know that some people - when changing purses - prefer to not have a built-in credit card and money section. With this purse I have separate pockets for phone, for keys, for money/credit cards so I always know where things are without having to go into the main body of the purse. The adjustable strap loses the &#34;folds&#34; after one use. The workmanship looks good. Great value for the money! I recommend this.	2015-08-15

This review is on behalf of my husband who has severe edema related to type 2 diabetes. His legs and feet are very large and mis-shapen and finding socks and shoes to fit and which look good is quite a challenge. We have purchased this type of shoe before and know that the entrance to the slip on is very narrow. No matter how wide the shoe we order the entrance doesn't correspond with the width. We did purchase shoe stretchers and shoe stretching spray to help alleviate that problem but somehow shoe and sock manufacturers don't seem to understand the trials of finding nice looking footwear for severe edema related problems. We have spent hundreds of dollars in this search and when we find something that works the manufacturer stops production and the search is on for something else. If I could go to a company, sit down with quality control and design something that makes buyers gasp in wonderment it would make my day. I recently purchased three pair of these shoes in various colors and hope that Propet continues to manufacture these shoes but with a WIDER entrance for the foot to slip in. My husband hates the clunky looking diabetic shoes on the market that come with a Velcro closure. He wants a classy looking comfortable shoe and I don't blame him. Now, if we can just find him great socks to fit his feet and legs.	2015-08-15

Why the 5 star rating, then? I returned them the first time because I thought they were too big. The heel cup was great, the middle section hugged my foot like a glove, the sole was super thin, but the toe box was really big. I returned them, only to discover after further reading that a wide toe box is good in a minimalist shoe. It allows for a natural splaying of the toes. I ordered a smaller size anyway and my toes banged against the end of the shoe. I returned them for being too small. I would have bought another pair, but realized another shoe, with a bit of padding, would be better for me for running longer distances. I went with Carson Footwear. However, if I ever have a wad of extra cash laying around, I would buy these again for everyday wearing and short runs.	2015-08-15

They were somewhat narrow in the width, and too much room for the toes to slosh around. Given that they are almost as heavy as my military boots with steel toes in them, I was constantly trying to keep them tight. Perhaps this is just a break in period?<br /><br />They do feel and appear to be good in quality but a tad bit too stiff... again, perhaps it needs to go through the break in stage a bit longer.<br /><br />I cannot say if I would recommend a smaller size, as the width is narrow, but maybe double socks for the first few times wearing them?	2015-08-15

All my other Keens have an elastic lace that the clip holds tightly so they don't loosen.  Why did you change this, one of the most important features for fit?  I understand it in a shoe or boot, but, not a pair of sandals.  We ordered a pair of Newports for my husband on the same order and his came with the elastic laces.  I finally found a pair of elastic ones at Cabela's to replace the originals.  Problem was solved.  Too bad I had to solve my own problem.  I ended up with neon green laces, not the end of the world, but, not what I wanted in a $100 pair of sandals either.	2015-08-15

I ended up returning these because there was a divot right over my middle toes in both shoes that rubbed even when I wasn't moving. I hope it was a defect in that particular pair as usually I have great luck with Asics. I also noticed there wasn't as much arch support as I am used to in my running shoes so after a quarter of a mile, I had made the decision that these shoes weren't for me. I am looking to replace my Gel Excites and based on other reviews, these seemed like a great option so I'm pretty bummed. I'll keep looking for Asics to replace my older pair, but I'll probably head to a running store so I can get sized and a feel for them before I buy.	2015-08-15

I bought this for my wife who has a terrible time trying to find a bag that works, but is not over-doing it.  She loves the material because it is pliable and so soft inside. The color was exactly like the picture. She can use it for work and also use it for a diaper bag for when we go out. This bag has been a winner with her and she won't go back to any of her other bags, or use the other diaper bags because this looks very smart and chic. It goes with just about any outfit, including just yoga pants and a shirt. She has had many compliments with it.  If you want to make your wife happy, get her this bag, hands down!	2015-08-15

Cushioning is thin, but comfortable all around the feet and the minimal arch seats just right.<br /><br />I've put about 50mi in them and they certainly remain dry and cool.<br /><br />The only issue I'm starting to see is the durability of the sole. While the foam-like sole is comfortable and absorbs adequate amounts of shock, it has begun to start peeling. Bits of yellow have started to flake off whether from running on a trail (and I'm assuming grinding on rocks or wood) or walking around and occasionally dragging my feet.<br /><br />However for the value and comfort it is definitely minor flaw and I would definitely consider buying another pair.	2015-08-15

It arrived the day before I left and my first thought was that it would be too small. I threw it in my suitcase anyway, having no other choice. How wrong I was! Once I arrived, this bag held all my essentials perfectly during days of sightseeing without weighing me down. My iPhone 6 fit in the front zippered pocket, my passport was secure in one of the inner zipper pockets. I could carry my sunglasses, small travel guide, face powder and lipstick, and even my epipen and inhaler. It also has plenty of spaces for multiple kinds of currency and needed credit cards. In short, it's an ingenious little bag that easily expands to accommodate all those daily essentials. It's a great travel partner along with a larger backpack or travel bag that can be left behind at the hotel. Now that I'm home, I use it often for quick trips around town or when shopping.	2015-08-15

I ordered my first pair incorrectly with a low prescription thinking that was the starting point and it would progressively increase. Returned them for a 2nd pair which i wore for a few weeks,<br />That pair was also returned in a bag with the right temple broken off and nose piece pin snapped. Damage occurred with a small drop from breast pocket to hard floor.<br />Amazon promptly shipped 3rd pair which I now have received. The same temple was loose compared to right side at the hinge right out of the box.<br />So these I am trying to keep these protected and not put them in their case or carry them around.<br /><br />Amazon has been great with the return and replacement. I agree with some customers who complain they can;t find the return area on the website . That was tricky for me as well. But is an option in your cart or when your on the product selection page. It may nto appear if you had not ordered the part so I 'm not sure if that's what made it difficult.<br /><br />I would stay away from these glasses if your needing to carry them around with you to many places.<br /> But they are worth a shot if you need bifocals or more.  You may need to return them however i suspect this risk is no worse with any other web order business and Amazon has an easy method for returns.	2015-08-15

It is a very nice bag, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I was wondering about the actual dimensions of this bag, so here you go: 11.5&#34; x 10.5&#34; x 3&#34; at the top and 4.5&#34; at the bottom. That's measuring seam to seam, since the bag can take different dimensions when full, of course. (Actually, the width is 11&#34; at the top and 11.5&#34; further down.)<br /><br />I was hoping to be able to carry 8.5&#34;x11&#34; things in here, and that will work. You can't carry 11&#34; things in the back pocket, though, because of the way it's tacked down.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Perfect deep teal color.<br />2. Heavy, high-quality leather<br />3. Loads of pockets to help keep things organized: back outside, narrow side pocket, front inside (just under the flap), and then the main compartment has a zipper pocket on one side and two open stash pockets on the other side.<br />4. Adjustable-length shoulder strap, and the nifty conversion to backpack<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I was hoping to be able to carry 8.5&#34;x11&#34; things in here, and that will work. But I wish they'd made this just a smidge wider.<br />2. You can't carry 11&#34; things in the back pocket, though, because of the way it's tacked down.<br /><br />Other:<br />1. I couldn't tell online, but the buckle on the front is for show and conceals a magnetic clasp underneath. Similarly, the back pocket is not entirely open and has a small magnetic clasp<br />2. I also had no idea from looking online that there's a sunglasses pocket on the side of the bag. This has a somewhat awkward closure with a strip of leather that slides under a loop (no real fastener). I probably would have preferred this to just be open, without that awkward closure.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to get this bag at a discount from its current price on Amazon, so I'm feeling pretty lucky about that. If you find this bag from another seller online, it's about $100 more than Amazon's currently selling it for. (Yeah, the tag on the bag itself says $188, and Amazon's current price is $88.)<br /><br />Among the things I most love about this bag is that I can expect to have it for years because it's such nice leather and so well made.about $100 more than Amazon's currently selling it for.
