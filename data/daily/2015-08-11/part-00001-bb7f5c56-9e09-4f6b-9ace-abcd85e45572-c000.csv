These are a little on the warm side, however.  The little acorn emblem under my bare heel is aggravating, a silly idea, not thought out well.  Comfort should be the priority, not advertisement, no matter how hidden, cute or small.  I can feel the bump at times and it is annoying.  With socks, no problem.  These are easy-on, so I will use them, but I may move them to winter where the warmth will be welcome and socks will be worn regularly.	2015-08-11

I have been wearing Tevas for years, and these are adjustable (velcro straps everywhere) and comfortable (padding at all the places where they might rub) as always.  They are good for a quick trip to the store or an all day adventure like going to the fair, or even kayaking or canoeing.  I like the look of these with the light colored sole vs the black sole of most of the other pairs.  The one difference between these and my previous pair is they are a little noisier - the heel makes a 'clopping' noise on the wood floor, but it isn't a big deal.  I think they just firmed up the sole for better support.	2015-08-11

These are one of the more comfortable Zumba shoes I have purchased. They provide good support yet are light and breathable.

In my rough day-to-day wear, I found them to last about a year, give or take a few months. That always seemed fair for me since I'd buy them two at a time at some place that offered buy one get one half off. They took well to a buff and always looked professional.<br /><br />Eventually, I bought 6 pairs of the Viper II line, not waterproof. Rub in some mink oil, spray with KIWI, and re-oil/spray every month or two, and I'm good. They took SEVERE abuse, including lots of rain, puddles, mud, soft earth, shallow swamps and accidental dunks when misjudging said water sources, and I never had a single problem.<br /><br />I decided to finally upgrade and try these out after I ran through all my old Vipers. These are supposed to be WATERPROOF, and I know what that entails with these: light rain and a puddle or two are a-okay, but anything heavy or deeper than your ankle and you're severely pushing it and should've donned rubbers.<br /><br />First impressions were good. They looked like a good leather and a Gore-Tex type weave. The tab to help pull the boot on is leather instead of fabric, but it's too low and short to be of real help. Maybe making it a loop would've been better. Finally, the leather looked more matte than my previous boots, but I like it. It's easier to maintain a professional look than shiny leather.<br /><br />I broke them in the usual way: a day of wearing them around the house chasing my son. I immediately noticed they were more narrow than my previous Vipers in wide (EE), but I figured I'd let them stretch naturally instead of a boot stretcher. I haven't dealt with waterproof inner linings, so I didn't want to take a chance.<br /><br />I had one assignment in light rain. They did their job – my feet stayed dry and I finished out the day; HOWEVER, the next day the &#34;leather&#34; was rubbing off of the toe!<br /><br />The leather doesn't feel right anymore. It feels like it soaked up a lot of water. The lining kept medry, but the leather seems easily damaged. After being dry enough on the surface and needing to wear them again, I went to take my buff sponge to it quickly and the leather flaked and crumbled off the toe. I also obviously see some of the glue used to finish the sole.<br /><br />These disappoint me. One star for not being a catastrophic failure and one star for keeping my feet dry... one day.<br /><br />I'm returning these and do not recommend them.	2015-08-11

I ordered these because they looked fun and different--and I really like the comfort of Cole Haan boots.  However, they weren't very cute upon arrival.  They sort of reminded me of pilgrim shoes.

They slid on my feet pretty easy and are not difficult to walk in.	2015-08-11

Some people lament these sandals as the second coming of jesus, it would seem by the reviews.  My previous sandals from another company gave me 7 good years, and I was looking for a follow-up pair for that purpose.  After wearing these for a few weeks, I'm not convinced.  Initially, I only wore these a couple of hours at a time, and did minimal walking to try and break the sandals in.  However, they've failed to completely break in, and one has a large bump/knot on one of the sandals, which has left me with a painful blister after wearing them for a couple of hours. The other sandal doesn't have this defect, so I'm not sure if I should try to request a new one or manually fix it.	2015-08-11

I own many FitFlops, mostly the ones that slide through the large toe and 2nd toe. I love my Lulu's (in pewter), mostly use them for dressier occasions. I couldn't find a pair in black leather so I opted for these. I love them! I hiked in them at a high altitude and was very grateful to adjust them as my legs/feet became swollen. The color is fabulous and they are my new favorite. I highly recommend them.	2015-08-11

Pulling them out of the box, their light weight is readily apparent. When skating, they don't feel like they're weighing you down at all. The soles allow for good grip and feel of the board, but not so much so that the vibrations are issue. They are good for just cruising as well since the shoes are very comfortable. I cannot speak on arch support as I have very flat feet. The laces are a bit further back from the toe end of the shoe which lends to lack of wear on the laces for flip tricks. For overall durability, The shoe is still holding up just fine, but I think the toe ends will wear through relatively quickly as the harder suede lining around the edge is already starting to fade from repeated flip tricks. I think if this had a harder toe cap to enhance its durability, it may be the perfect skate shoe.	2015-08-11

I don't care who you are or what shape your face is, these will look great on you!  The Duduma Premium Full Mirrored Aviator Sunglasses come in a very nice drawstring bag with a cleaning cloth, which is wonderful, not many other companies do this with their sunglasses.  It helps to keep track of them and keep the mirrored lenses scratch free so they will look wonderful and last a very long time.<br />I received the silver frames with the purple mirror lens, and they look great when you are wearing them.  My daughters came for a visit, and my youngest daughter tried them on, and needless to say, she took them home with her!!! They are great at reducing the glare of the sun, and are perfect for driving , fishing or any outdoor activity where you want to reduce the glare so that you can enjoy the day.<br />I highly recommend these, you won't be sorry you got them.<br />I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

Love this purse, the size which will fit a cell phone easy, plus other little essentials, do not want a big bag for a formal event.  This is the right size.  It is dressy enough but not overly done, and overstated.  Bought the Silver Dyeable heels from Amazon also.  Have gorgeous Aurora Borealis chunky necklace bracelet, and rings too match.  Will look amazing with my gorgeous sky turquoise blue dress.<br /><br />A very pretty purse for a not outrageous price.  Now what I do not like, I have a black purse similar to this one, but I like having two handles better the none, one looks strange too me, ought to be two.  My other minor issue, is the chain is just too long.  No matter what I did, it was too long.  They say for a formal occasion, chain should not be that long.  So I like it better without the chain.  Would of liked two handles which is easy to hold, and a chain that does not hang all the way down to your knees.  Other then these minor issues, I love the purse.  Great looking, fancy but not gawky looking.  Roomy for that formal occasion, can hold my cell to take pictures at a wedding.  Good price.  Fast ship.  Minor complaints do not effect my overall feeling of this purse.<br /><br />A great purse at a very good price.  But would love to see this purse with two handles and a shorter chain.	2015-08-11

I have not worn them outside yet, because I may have to return them. They seem to come up too far on my ankle bones and I'm concerned that they will rub blisters. Not sure what to do, I really can't tell for sure if I can't actually &#34;try them out&#34;, but don't want to be stuck with them if they do cause blisters. I'm only giving them 3 stars for this reason. If I decide to &#34;run with them&#34; and they turn out to be okay, I will update.	2015-08-11

Their sneakers, boots and sandals have always fit well and have been very comfortable. However, these are the second pair of Merrell sandals I am returning this year. The fit of this sandal seems to be a half size larger and wider but the worst of it is that these are not the Merrell quality I am used to. The straps are leather but are lined with a cheap nylon and the foot bed is made of a hard, stiff plastic which I'm sure will be uncomfortable and make my feet hot, not at all like the flexible, absorbent material they have used in the past.  I returned the previous pair also because of inferior quality, but I wanted to give them another chance. I am very disappointed that I can no longer buy Merrells with confidence. They have lost a loyal customer.	2015-08-11

These vintage aviator sunglasses came as a surprise to me. When I ordered them, I did not pay attention to the color of the lenses that I ordered. When I received them in the mail, I was shocked at the rich red color of the lenses. When I tried them on, they fit well, and I liked them just fine, but I realized that I knew someone who could put them to much better use. My mother. My mother was born with Achromatopsia, which is a hereditary visual disorder, characterized by decreased vision, light sensitivity, and the absence of color vision. It turns out, that the only color lenses that are comfortable for her to wear out in the sun, (we live in the Florida sun at that), is RED. While she owns a pair of red sunglasses, her lenses are small, and the boxy plastic frames annoy her. I immediately ran in to give these to her, and she was so happy she almost cried. These sunglasses covered her field of vision wonderfully, and the red color is so rich that she can comfortably walk outside to watch her children play, or even to check the mail. I LOVE these glasses. They answered a prayer.	2015-08-11

The box that it came in is nice and sturdy and nicely displayed the shoes inside.  It was a great presentation and almost comparable to Pediped's presentation.

I wear a size 11.5 in all other shoes and the smallest they had left was a 11.5 so in combination with the aggressive shoe style and laces any slack wouldn't be a problem. Received the shoe and tried them on with on luck to even get the shoe on my foot. I then sent way for a larger size and got the 12.5 and was still to small. My feet were smashed into the shoe completely unable to move toes and only able to wear the shoes for maybe 5 minutes without having to take them off due to he pain. My piece of wisdom is DO NOT! buy these shoes unless you have tried them on and know exactly what size you need.	2015-08-11

These are just slightly disappointing.  First of all, why is the women's version only available with colored soles?  Secondly, the straps are a bit loser than they used to be.  So feels a bit less secure than previous versions.  Finally, the soles are slippery when compared to the previous all black version.<br /><br />Having said all of that, they are still comfortable shoes.  Just wish they were a solid color, and not quite so slick on the soles.	2015-08-11

These are the most comfortable shoes I have now!! The reviews are right, this model is a little narrow towards the front of the shoe but I think over time, it will be just fine!

I couldn't have done all I did with any other shoe on, my knees and my back and my feet would have hurt too much!! Will be buying another pair, just don't know what color!!

So whenever I want to hang out by myself, I just put these supergoggles on. The little nose pads hurt my nose big time and leave marks. Still, cocky sunglasses with gold frames are awesome.

I agree with the reviewer who thought the Indonesians don't believe our feet can really be 4E width! New Balance quality control is lacking in these boots. E should be 4E not 'depending on the last,' or what country the shoe is made. If New Balance actually had an inspector put the shoe on, they would know the width difference and then remodel the last. This problem should be vigorously addressed by AMAZON. If we can't buy shoes on line and depend on the fit, we will then have to go to the brick and mortar store. Take note AMAZON!!!!	2015-08-11

However, the only dividers are made from a thin silk-like material that will do little to protect your phone from any other items in your bag.<br /><br />Overall, I think its an inexpensive, cute wristlet.

I received them at work and after trying them on real quick, I didn't want to go back to my other shoes.  I ended up buying the same pair twice because the price dropped significantly while I was waiting for them to arrive and just figured I would return the first, more expensive pair and keep the second, cheaper pair...but when I showed my mom and she tried them on, she asked if she could keep them and just write me a check haha. (She wore them that whole day and has worn them several times since and loves them too).<br /><br />I should note that yesterday, I wore them when I went for a walk in the park with a friend, and after about a mile, the front strap did start to rub a blister on my pinky toe...but I've also worn them to Disneyland for several hours and had no pain or issues that day..so it could have been a fluke, or the heat or just the faster more &#34;exercise&#34; pace of the walking. Regardless I'm very happy with them and have already bought another style of fitflops! I'm a runner and am realizing that it's time to start taking better care of my body and I love that I've found a sandal that helps with that.<br /><br />I'm going to Disneyworld next month and plan to wear these sandals quite a bit!	2015-08-11

I have to say, I'm not a fan of these kind of shoes ( loafers/boat shoes ), I don't like how they look, they are not my style, so I don't ever buy anything like this. Plus, because of my high arches, I'm weary of anything flat flat. It makes my whole body, not just my legs, tired and sore in no time.  But, I read so many reviews online praising these to be so unbelievable comfy, and as I was looking for some kind of a summer shoe that is not open, and it's comfortable enough for running around the city all day if necessary... I took my chances with these. And, oh my! They truly are so unbelievably comfy! Gotta love 'em, even though I still don't quite like how they look ( but, that's just me and my personal preferences ). But, I'll forgive them their looks, I'll forgive them anything just because of that amazing comfort they provide.  They do run quite wide. I got them in my true size, and they fit perfectly... But, being so wide, my feet/heels slip out sometimes as I walk. I tried half size smaller the other day in store, but that was painfully tight length wise ( and especially front wise )... But, they were still so wide. Even though the front of the shoes was painfully tight, these, too, were about to let my heels slip out as I was walking around. I guess it is just the model of this shoe, and one should take it into consideration. They are true to size, but run too wide. I can deal with it. But, I'm still looking for some kind of &#34;fix&#34; for this &#34;situation&#34;, so if anybody has any idea, please let me know.   These shoes are so comfortable, they even provide support for my high arches. I can run around the city all day wearing these without a problem. No blisters, no pain, no tired feet, no pain in legs and lower back.... I don't even think about wearing anything else when I know I'm gonna have a lot of running around in front of me... So, they are keepers. Even with that one &#34;lil&#34; &#34;negative&#34; detail. :) ( And, that is why 4 stars )Other than that, I absolutely love them. Even their look is starting to grow on me. :) Ummm.... I even got another pair of these, in different color. :)	2015-08-11

He never wore them as a child, but cancer left him with poorer vision and now he needs readers. The man is a sunglass lover; he will wear them on the cloudiest days. Now, he likes his sunglasses to have a bifocal reader portion to them. We used to purchase them in store, but they were so expensive.<br />So happy we found these guys! He loves the colors and they work exceptionally well for their intended purpose.<br />At first, the seller sent us the wrong item but worked quickly to resolve the issue. Thanks, seller!<br />Overall, happy with the purchase and based on my dad's track records with glasses, we will be back for more in the future!	2015-08-11

Hands down these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  Literally WAY more comfortable than even my best pair of tennis shoes.  Plus their size selection guide was great, especially with all of the different widths available.  I can't speak to the drainability and all that as I do not plan to get them wet anyway- I wear sandals on our boat which seems much more practical to me- but they are great for general use.	2015-08-11

I usually wear 9.5 in shoes, but only whole sizes were available so I sized up to a 10.  The ankle strap hooks rather than buckles, so it doesn't adjust and fits loosely, but the stiffness of the fabric makes it work-it stays straight-not floppy.  The footbed is only a little too long but not enough that they don't feel right. Overall a great value in a very stylish sandal. The heel height is not too high or low, feels stable when walking.  I only gave it 4 stars because it's a fabric shoe rather than hide or leather, so I doubt it would hold up over many seasons of wear, but time will tell!  Wear it with skinny jeans, pencil skirts or dresses.	2015-08-11

The heel is narrow but sturdy and looks higher than 4&#34; but you can strut in them feeling confident and (don't forget) sexy! :)  I am now contemplating purchasing the gray pair, but they are higher than the other two pairs purchased so I may have to wait on them but I will be wearing these shoes until it gets 40 below here in DC! lol  These are too sharp to put away any time soon! Don't hesitate, Diva, to pick up a pair or two of these pumps! You won't be disappointed!  In fact, you'll be tempted to buy another pair! Enjoy and &#34;don't hurt nobody&#34;!  lol	2015-08-11

I bought these about 8 months ago and wanted to see how long they lasted and wearability.  The first thing I noticed is that they are incredibly light and comfortable because of the memory foam lining.  I am a HS Chemistry teacher on my feet all day at least 10 hours and after 65 years of wearing shoes these are the MOST COMFORTABLE I have ever owned.  Good looks????? at my age I really do not care.  They have survived toxic spills and deep rain puddles and clean and restore within a short time.  They adapt to all surfaces including gravel and have never  accused them of being slippery.  i quit wearing dress shoes and wear these exclusively.  I can't wait until the Go Walk 4's come out!!	2015-08-11

These are definitely the most comfortable climbing shoes I've ever worn. I actually bought my own shoe size (despite everyone telling me that I should buy shoes 1 - 2 sizes smaller) and I can definitely say that they are amazing.  I climb once a week (sometimes twice) and the soles have really held up.  The outter edge on both sides has worn down considerably now that I'm climbing more 5.9s and 5.10s which is upsetting. I wish this edge held out longer, but that's really the only complaint I have.<br /><br />These shoes also didn't start smelling for about the first 6 months of use which I'm considering a definite plus. The velcro is also super convenient.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy again.	2015-08-11

I bought them to wear on an archaeological excavation in the desert and they are still in great shape five weeks later. A lot of other people had the issue of their soles melting off (and this on $80 shoes), but mine held together great. I would recommend buying the largest size you typically buy, as the toes are a little narrow. And if you plan to spend more than a couple hours in them at a time I would also get insoles as they have little so far as arch support when you are on you feet for eight hours at a time. Other than that, they are super comfortable and are worth the money.<br /><br />Even after the dig, I am still wearing them to work!	2015-08-11

Comfortable, but the opening of the boot is way too wide for my taste. The boots looks good on, in a funky sort of way, but I felt asi if I could use the extra space from the opening as a storage bin. If you have skinny legs, they'll swim in these; I don't, and yet they still seemed too large. The quality was consistant with the price of the boot. It is nice that the ankle straps can be tightened, but it only makes the top of the boot stick out further. The look reminds of a pair of high-top tennis shoes being tied at the ankle. I returned them because I didn't like the open tongue on the boot, but boots  are not bad looking.	2015-08-11

I was looking for a water shoe that stayed on in the water, while providing support while climbing on rocks. I've been very happy with these shoes and love how cute they are. I've had several people ask me where I got them. Although I love the shoe, I was disappointed to see that they got a tear on the side where the mesh is after the first time wearing them. I would suggest ordering these a full size smaller than your regular size to make sure they don't fall off in the water. I ordered a full size smaller and they fit perfect. Overall a great and stylish water shoe.	2015-08-11

I was very pleased with my my purchase of Twisted kix black plaid shoes. I purchased a size 6 which typically I wear a size 5.5, the size 6 was a near perfect fit and a 5.5 would have most likely have been too slender for my foot as the size 6 is perfectly snug fit as per width, if I had gone a size smaller I don't think I'd be as happy with the product, this would be the only advisory I'd post regarding this brand.<br />Otherwise the shoes are surprisingly sturdy in build as per their price bracket. No inconsistencies in the shoe itself. No discomfort, in fact these are possible one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn straight out of the box! I can only imagine the comfort increases with time as the shoe shapes to accomodate your feet. The fabric clearly of quality, the rubber portion of the shoes are not as up to par on quality as I can see these most likely won't get years of usage, but at the same time I feel confident they will last me a full 12 months at least. The color and design is fabulously adorable! I've placed an order for 2 more pairs in various colors I love them that much! All in all the price was more than right and I am beyond happy with my choice in product!	2015-08-11

Watersedge has the same ES stability, comfort and quality of the others with an nice improvement.  The upper shoe has less mesh for more durability.  My little and big toe would eventually tear a hole through the mesh of the older versions.  I wear Watersedge all day and love it for travel.  It's a more stylish alternative to a lace up walking shoe.  I gave it 4 stars because one change is not a particularly welcome one: the strap is now made of elastic, not leather.  I hope the elastic will last and not stretch out.  As a new shoe, I find the elastic does not give the stability I am used to. If ES would go back to a solid strap, this one would be perfect.	2015-08-11

So this time around I was a little hesitant to buy other timberland boots, but when I saw that there was a wider width size and a very thick soles I immediately bought them.

I have to say they are the best boots I've had. Out of the box I was able to walk around all day without the need for breaking them in. I had no blisters at the end of the day. It was pouring rain at times and I was on a mix of city streets and muddy trails (mild-moderate hike) and my feet stayed bone dry. I have now worn them daily for a week and feel equally as happy with them. The elastic like material on the ankle makes them easy to get on. They have a great fashionable look to them as well and go with pants or skirts/dresses. I will note that there I don't think there is much ankle support, which is fine for me as I don't tend to have ankle issues, but for others that may wander up a trail in these may want to keep that in mind. I don't think they are meant for hiking, but I have found them great for my on a whim trails discovered here and there.	2015-08-11

I shopped around area stores and could not find anything I liked so decided to &#34;see&#34; what was available on amazon. After viewing the midi sling bag online, I decided to &#34;take a chance&#34;. I hate purchasing wallets without seeing them first...its hard to judge size, number of available compartments etc. However the midi sling bag appeared to be closer to what I was looking for (i.e. a wallet or wallet-sized purse WITH a strap). I received the bag in a timely manner and so far I like it a lot. It is a bit bigger than what I was expecting but I have enough room to put my cell phone and keys inside. I am a bit concerned that one of the zippers seems to get a bit &#34;stuck&#34; from time to time...I hope this does not become an issue...only time will tell.	2015-08-11

First, let me say that by &#34;fits as expected&#34; I mean that I ordered a size larger than I would normally based on the Vibram site's size calculator and some reviews, so fits as expected by &#34;them&#34;.  I did not get to try on the size smaller, but the ones I have seem to fit well, possibly a wee tad large, but if so, it is not a problem.  As I walk, my toes slide to the ends, yet they don't feel loose at the heels.  I couldn't find a convenient local store to try them on -- our EMS is too small.  Second, this is my second pair of toe shoes, but my first Vibrams.  My first were Fila Skeletoes, which I liked quite well and lasted about 4-5 years.  I would have gotten another pair of Filas, but they look different and I found these for the same price in a color I liked better.<br /><br />This model seemed to be the closest I could find to the Skeletoes I loved in terms of being good for both walking/hiking/running and water sports.  They have a little more aggressive tread, which will probably come in handy, yet they feel just as barefoot as my Filas.  The top being mesh makes them less hot and stinky, and there's an antimicrobial something-or-other involved that may help that, too.  I have worn them twice without feeling the need to wash them yet.  I assume they'll dry faster, too.  My only concern with the mesh is that it might get caught on a stick and rip easily.  These seal around my foot better and are higher in the back, which should help keep debris and sand from sneaking in -- as much fun as it sounds.  The only thing I like better about my old Filas is that the inside of these feels rougher.  I'm wondering if they will give me callouses over time if I wear them a lot.  I hope they hold up as well over time as my Filas did ... and that Fila goes back to making them (seem to no longer be making them).<br /><br />Fyi, I use these mostly for trail walking for trips of an hour or so, occasional trail or road running and very occasional swimming.  I findthey are very handy to keep in the car so I can always be prepared for any adventure in three seasons, especially on road trips.  The barefoot feel is kind of neat, though not good on dirt roads with coarse gravel/stones -- too painful over time.  And on walks in the woods, you'll look down on occasion and find that your toes are sprouting ferns.  : )  You do occasionally wind up having to pick out a painful stick or small rock from the toes, and do be careful of stubbing your toes.  It can be an exercise in mindfulness when walking or running in woods -- you need to pay attention to where you are putting your feet, but I find that while I'm busy trying not to break a toe, the miles are rolling under me.  : )<br /><br />Oh -- these came with an odd little storage (?) bag.  I guess it would be good for packing them in a suitcase, but so would a ziplock .  I have no idea why there's a hole in the middle -- to suspend it on a pole?  Seems unnecessary -- I'd rather have them be a little cheaper and skip the silly bag.	2015-08-11

I wore these boots the first day for 12 hours straight out of the box with almost all of this time spent on my feet and they are extremely comfortable.  They were stiff at first but softened very quickly.  I like these boots more than any I have worn.  I can think of nothing negative to say about them except that I find them difficult to remove.  I would definitely buy them again.	2015-08-11

I bought these because they were inexpensive, and non-leather, but not cheap plastic throw-aways. LIttle did I know that I would need them to be rough, all terrain mountain footwear; however, with no other option, I recently wore my Sanuks on a &#34;tubing&#34; expedition wherein I often had to wade through 6 inches or more of swift moving river over a rocky bed. These &#34;sandals&#34; held on to my feet and held up to the task. I was amazed. I bought three of these at once because of the low price (and, you know, Prime), but may never need the other 2. This was after a summer's worth of near daily use. Incredible construction and durability for a &#34;flip flop.&#34;	2015-08-11

I stand on my feet for 13 hours a day (yes really), and Clarks' Wave line are the only shoes that provide enough comfort and support for those long days.

They don't provide much in the way of arch support, but nothing that a pair of inserts can't solve.

I love these sandals, and they look great. They fit perfectly, and you can dress them up or down. I've gotten a ton of compliments on them. The only disappointment with these is that they are totally worn out already from normal usage after only about 5 months of wearing. Otherwise, I would have left a 5 star rating.	2015-08-11

I have owned two pairs of Maui Jim sunglasses and they both required repair. The last pair I had for less than a year. I sent them in to Maui Jims and they said the lenses shattering was not covered under the warranty. They charged me $8 shipping and handling each way, to find out that it would be an additional $60 to replace the lenses. I have owned Ray-Bans, Vuarnets, Hobie's, and Oakleys and have never had any problems with any of them. The only time I had to replace any of those brands is when I lost them. Extremely disappointed in Maui Jim sunglasses!!!	2015-08-11

Coming back from some surgery and just started doing a little personal training. Started using my Reebok running shoes (DMX Sky Impact), but found I wasn't very stable when it came to doing half splits and reverse lunges because the heel cushioning was designed with active running in mind and not really for training in a gym (in my opinion). Brought these at the suggestion of my trainer and absolutely love them. I have a solid connection with the floor and can really focus on my placement and movement. Arch support seems good so far. Loved the &#34;Find the Right Size&#34; tool on the Amazon page. I put in model and size of my current shoe to find out what size I should order for the Nano. I wear a 10.5 in the DMX, but an 11 in the Nano. Would never of thought to change size. And the fit is great!	2015-08-11

They are light and fairly comfortable though. The sides of the shoe where the eyelets are located do not come together very close when laced which makes them look a little weird and affects the stability of the shoe. The shoes were inexpensive but I would rather have used that money toward a quality shoe that had good support. New Balance are definitely more expensive but they are a quality shoe.

Bought this same slingback in a regular black leather, and when I couldn't find those, I bought this lace version. I wore them to work practically every day, looked great with jeans. I will say I wear a lot of heels and knew to order a half size larger for this pointed toe style, so that definitely makes it more comfortable.<br /><br />I walked a lot for my job -- sometimes outside, sometimes inside, and the heel got worn down to the metal spike, so there was no traction, so I don't recommend walking on rough surfaces too much. The lace on the tip of the toe did end up peeling up, but again, that is by the time I had worn the heel down to metal. One pair usually lasts me a year, but that is with almost every day M-F use, so I've gone through 3 pairs.	2015-08-11

The only issue I'd have to say these boots have is that the zipper was REALLY hard to zip up and down, but I easily fixed that by rubbing wax (I used a candle) on the zipper. I can't wait for Fall to come so I can wear them!	2015-08-11

I've owned this exact style of Sketcher and similar for many years(have you ever had shoes without shoe strings? ask Kanye West...).<br />Keep in mind while you read this that every pair of Sketchers without laces prior to this have been nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />I got these on a lightening deal for about $20 off so I really wanted them to work out.<br /><br />The first pair I received sounded like you were walking on glue strips.<br />- Every step sounded like you were peeling your shoes off a sticky floor covered in half dried soda.<br />- They fit perfect with no issues in the soles(see second pair).<br /><br />The second pair I received did not have the glue strip sound when walking(so first pair was an anomaly).<br />- The first pair must have been a defect.<br />- Unfortunately the sole was not put in properly on the second pair leaving a bump in the rear of the heel.<br />- The poor glue job on the insole made it feel like you were walking on a rock all the time. Not fun.<br /><br />The third pair never came unfortunately.<br />- I requested third pair through the return process which was accepted, but the seller canceled the order and refunded the money.<br />- I really wanted this style of Sketchers, and they are normally $70 or so on here so I wasn't happy the seller didn't send the third pair.<br />- Does the seller think I'm making this stuff up? The issues with the shoes I got were easy to confirm.<br /><br />I bought a different style of sketchers very close to this style in black(same time I bought these with the deal), and they were perfect as expected.<br />I have this same exact pair that is over 3 years old that are still wearable(no major cracks in the leather, and look good).<br />Note that I treat all my Sketchers with leather protection to make them last longer(it makes a difference, spend the 10 bucks to protect them).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would buy these Sketchers again for $50/60 just to see if they are all defective(took years for my old ones to wear, still kicking).<br />Fortunately I have Amazon Prime with no hassle returns.ok years for my old ones to wear, still kicking).<br />Fortunately I have Amazon Prime with no hassle returns.	2015-08-11

Very handy. Love the wipe-clean finish, the paprika color very true to photos. Will buy another when (if?) this one wears out. Some women have multiple handbags, but I'm not one of them. I get one bag that I love and use it until it wears out. This is that kind of bag. Plus it comes in great colors. My favorite thing is that it has a cell phone pouch on the front, so I never have to search for my phone, and there is a zipper pouch next to it, where I keep my keys, so they're always handy. No perfect place for pens, but I use one of the end zipper pouches. There are two pen loops inside the main section at the top, but they're a bit awkward. Holds everything that I want to carry with me and then some. It could hold a lot more, but then it'd be too heavy. But when I have kids with me or I'm traveling, I can really load it up; though it holds it's shape when sparsely filled. Some bags look odd when nearly empty, which mine never seems to be. Only thing I don't like is the zipper on the bottom of the bag opens up a pocket that has a top zipper. So, if somehow it gets pulled open when you're not expecting it to be, like if the zipper tab got snagged on something or a kid yanked it, all the stuff in that pocket would just spill out. I've never had that happen, but the first time I unzipped that, expecting to find another compartment, I was surprised to see my stuff falling through. Maybe it's to make cleaning out the purse easier. I don't know, but it's not a big deal for me, and I love this bag.	2015-08-11

I usually love Clarks shoes and have never had a problem with the fit before. However these shoes do NOT fit true to size at all, and there is very little cushioning. I am a true 7, and these shoes squeeze my foot and are extremely uncomfortable especially in the toe area and ball of the foot. The toe area is super narrow and small, it rubs against the little toe and pinches your feet. Also the back of the boot is somehow loose and seems like it doesn't completely fit your heel. Its weird.<br /><br />The heel height is perfect, not too high, and it seemed like these would be great, but they're not.<br /><br />If you absolutely must buy these shoes, I would recommend buying 1/2 size up, buying a &#34;wide&#34; fit, and wearing them at home for an hour to make sure that you feel comfortable in them. Because they really are not comfortable. *tear*	2015-08-11

They are very lightweight, super comfy, pillowy even, and are surprisingly good on wet slippery granite (I went fly fishing and was wet wading in the sierra in some small and medium sized streams).  Though not super robust or something I would want to take on long hikes over angular rocky terrain, they are like sneakers for the outdoors and fine for shorter hikes or on soft forested trails.  I like them.  I just ordered a second pair in another color.  Too bad Patagonia is no longer making shoes.  The long laces thing… come on people, use some scissors, cut the nylon lace to your spec, then use a match to light the new cut and to keep them from fraying.  Longish is better than shortish.  Cut to fit.  Recommend these for sure.	2015-08-11

I've worn Keens for years, they are my go to shoes because I live in the mountains/forest. Anyhow, these seem to really bunch up at the tongue and press on the top of my feet. I have about 50 miles on them so far & the pinch is still there. I'd say my feet are average in width, length & arch for a female and I would not purchase this model again due to the pressing/pinch. I do not make much money, so I'm stuck with this pair for another year & hope the pinch subsides with time.	2015-08-11

I have very narrow feet and these were not working well at all.  They were HUGE on my feet - and yes, I went by The Walking Store and verified that I had the correct size.  Length wise they were fine.  Width - so so so wide.  Great color though.  Too bad :(  I ultimately ended up with Mephisto's....they fit a narrow foot perfectly.	2015-08-11

I was a bit timid about ordering from a vendor based outside the US (these are shipped from Germany), but the experience was smooth and the shoes arrived in about a week. I achieved an excellent fit by ordering my &#34;regular&#34; Birkenstock size. I'm a bit mixed about this new take on the Birkenstock. If (like me), you're used to the arch support you get from the traditional Birkenstock latex+cork footbed, you won't find that same support in the EVA footbed here. It's simply a different material and has an entirely different feel than the latex+cork. However, I still think these are comfortable sandals/flips and I'm happy with them. Th huge advantage they provide over the traditional Birkenstocks is that they can GET WET! That means I can wear them to the beach and pool (or even get caught in the rain), which is exactly what I was looking for. I'm a bit concerned about how the sole will wear (i.e. wear out) over time, as they don't seem very durable, but I don't have much experience with this material, so hopefully I will be happily surprised!	2015-08-11

Width was perfect although I typically have to buy a wide width shoe, so if you have a narrow foot, these may be too wide for you :) These are by far the most comfortable shoes I own! My best friend came to visit and she had this exact pair. I swore I would never pay that much for shoes, but decided to treat myself. They are super cushy but at the same time very stable if that makes sense? I usually hate walking around the mall because my feet and back start hurting about 30 minutes into it, but my husband and I walked around the mall for hours recently and I felt wonderful! Best part....no aching feet! And as a bonus they are pretty! I can wear them with shorts, jeans and dresses. They pretty much go with anything. I bought them in urban white, but I'm considering getting them in other colors now! These shoes are worth every penny!	2015-08-11

These shoes are gorgeous and will be perfect for my wedding. I wanted something pretty but with a modest heel so that I could comfortably wear them all night. The only thing that I'm not entirely in love with is the laces, which are made of literal lace. The lace is extremely stretchy, so it's difficult to get them tight without feeling like I will damage the laces. They could be easily replaced though and even though the laces feel delicate they are probably still fine. I would absolutely recommend these shoes to another buyer!	2015-08-11

Stretched them out regardless with my shoe stretcher for extra comfort. They look nice and the quality is decent given the price but they are insanely hard to walk in. It's not the heel, which feels sturdy and not in the least bit wobbly, but the way the sole platform is angled. I have no issue walking in 5 inch heels, but the slope of the concealed platform makes it easy for the foot to roll forward. Maybe I just have to get used to them...<br /><br />Regardless, precarious walking so be aware.	2015-08-11

Unfortunately, I just bought two pairs (black & white) and the current models both share a design flaw that makes them almost unwearable. As I saw mentioned in another review, the shoes rub against the back of your heel and create blisters within hours. The shoes are exactly the right size and otherwise fit perfectly.  It's odd because I used to wear these exclusively and never had an issue until this year.  There's a very hard edge you can feel rubbing on your heel as you walk.  I regret both purchases and hope Adidas fixes this problem ASAP.	2015-08-11

It is a bit close around the ankles but not right enough to stop blood. Plus owning tstrap sandals I know they cannot be loose or you will literally step out of the shoe.<br />Also my aunt who is a size 8 normally tried them on, and they fit her perfectly too, so they fit as expected.

I purchased this half asleep at 2 am during online outlet sale.  What caught my eye was the 2 tone (blk/white) with exotic trim handles.  For not being completely coherent,  I made one of my best coach purchases.<br />The outer compartment has a magnetic closure which I really like.  Phone or keys will stay secure.  Compartments will keep this medium bad organized.<br /><br />I admit I'm generally not a fan of pebble leather,  but with this bag I have zero criticism of the pebbled texture.  It's super soft. The minor gold details give this purse a unique look.  Many bags look common or cookie-cutter to me. I don't think I'll be seeing a deluge of women carrying this bag.	2015-08-11

TAKE OUT THE INSOLE, it becomes a different shoe!<br /><br />Pro:  (1) Fits True to size (2) NO overlay issues (3) Super flexibility adapts to your foot (4) Great barefoot feel<br />Con:  Upper mesh does not breathe as well as other brands --not for sweaty feet in the summer.<br /><br />I bought these shoes online, sight unseen.  Having run in NB's and Merrells in the past couple of years, I felt fairly confident about my choice.<br />No disappointment-- right out of the box, they first felt bulky and tight -- until I pulled out the insole (looked and felt about a 2mm difference) which made a nice roomy improvement.<br />I appreciated the rounded heel for running, since it was automatic feedback on whether or not I was properly landing on my midfoot, or hitting my heel too hard.  Online, they looked a bit narrow, but they held my Fred-Flintstone feet perfectly. Also, even though these were an ounce or two heavier than my Merrell's, I definitely did not feel it as I ran at my usual pace with no extra effort.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I could somewhat complain about is the closed-mesh  material of the upper -- if you're the sweaty-foot type  -- or in my case, sweaty-everywhere type.... these shoes don't feel like they breathe all that well. (Perhaps the Finns, understandably, are not as concerned with sweating as we Californians) This could be a concern if you're paranoid about blistering, or live in a humid area.  This is the only reason I took off a star, otherwise the shoe is pretty close to perfect.<br />Two Non-complaints :  (1) I posted that there is no arch support, but being a barefoot-type shoe, there really shouldn't be.  (2) Not so good as a casual walking shoe, because there is a chance that after several minutes, it will clobber your heels if you're not careful (I heel-strike when I walk). But all racing flats seem to be that way.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you are already running with short, quick, light steps, give these yummy slippers a try.	2015-08-11

Waking on the hard floor and especially standing in the kitchen cooking would hurt my back. My back would ache all night. I didn't want slippers. I live in Florida and my feet get hot. I wanted flip flops that had a lot of cushion. These were the only ones I could fine so I thought why not for the price! WOW! So glad that I did find these flip flops. They are so soft! I have never tried a pair of shoes, slippers, etc that were so comfortable. The only con is that I didn't find these sooner. I'm buying a second pair to leave in my suit case. They have helped my back tremendously. I love to cook and now I can do it without being in pain.	2015-08-11

This pair must have missed the quality control inspectors.  One strap is very tight and the other is so loose that space is visible between it and the top of my foot.  The V at the toe is huge on one shoe and tiny on the other.  They were on sale.  Maybe you have to pay full price to get a matching pair?	2015-08-11

As a higher priced boot, I can assure you the quality really is second to none.  If loved and cared for, they will last you a lifetime I suspect.  Regarding the fit, I was fortunate enough to have an actual Red Wing dealer here in MN to assist me on my first pair.  So, after a measurement and fitting, I can confidently say that they generally run a full size large in length.  The width I would say tends to be true to size; thus my purchase of the wide size.  As a matter of comparison, I would typically purchase an 11 1/2 in a Frye boot to accommodate my wide foot and for length sake (Frye rarely makes a wide sized shoe...).  If you're having doubts, just google this boot and you'll see a multitude of blogs and pics all in adoration of these American classics.  As jaded as I am at times, even I have to jump on the band wagon on these...	2015-08-11

I bought these jelly shoes through the OKA-B site, yet it allowed me to use my Amazon credentials which was soooooo nice. I absolutely LOVE these shoes and want to order more items from them. Sadly, I'm very selective style-wise and most of the styles aren't mod like this. Anyway, back to my purchase. So comfy. Fit like a glove. I have chubby wide feet and am a &#34;freakish&#34; size 10. Most shoes are HUGE on me, yet I'm not a 9.5, I've sent back so many pairs of 10s to Amazon, I'm waiting for them to cut me off. Only Oka-B and Mel by Melissa seem to fit nicely. These shoes are great - easy to wash in the sink because they're jelly! I can't say enough. Also, side note, the packaging is beautiful.They arrived in a lovely Tiffany blue box designed with tree branches and the box actually closes magnetically I think? I'm a sucker for packaging. Please order these shoes, you will not be disappointed.	2015-08-11

They are on her feet for walks, trips to the store, preschool, dress up, you name it.  She LOVES them.  She has a lot of shoes, but we can not live without these.  I always make sure I have the next size already purchased and in the closet - because the second they get snug, we need a new pair.  She won't go a day without wearing these.	2015-08-11

Top of the shoe is a thin see-through mesh which makes them great for summer running but might be a bit cool in the winter.  One gripe. Out of the box one of the metal lace eyelets had a small flaw that left a jagged edge.  First couple of runs the flaw rubbed through my sock and left a bloody, painful abrasion. I have worked at it a bit and I think the flaw is gone - we'll find out in a day or two when the foot heals.  But is it a disappointing quality control failure on an expensive shoe.	2015-08-11

Nice and roomy for my baby's chunky feet. The leather was soft and the soles have nice grip. Many baby shoes won't bend with the baby's steps but these did. She's worn these all summer long and now that she had a growth spurt I will be purchasing the next size up. Everyone complimented how adorable her gold sandals were!!<br /><br />Edit to add: I ordered the next size up and they were the same size as the outgrown shoes.

The logo on the side wears off real fast but I don't care.  These shoes have good board feel and just enough impact protection for me (I'm 165 lbs).  I would like a little more impact cushion but I still like these.  I shoe-goo'd mine after a few sessions and they're still going strong more than a month later.  One very good thing about these shoes is the sole.  The sole tread is thick, not balding (going flat / slick), and is holding up well even though I skate with MOB grip which usually wears out the sole of your shoes real fast.  Definitely worth the $27 I paid.	2015-08-11

They are fairly comfortable, but the pictures do not match what I received. The boots are depicted as having a black sole and heel. However, when they arrived, I realized that the sole and heel are actually wooden colored (light brown/beige). This makes the sole and heel look like they are on the wrong shoes and also makes them much more casual. I bought these because I thought I could wear them to go out and/or for work, but the color of the base makes me think that they are not going to pass as work appropriate. I may return them, but they ship from China and the shipping costs may not be worth the hassle.  **Update- after about a half hour of wear around the house, the lining inside of the boots got all bunched up and undone. Boots are not well made. Seller offered me a refund on the boots but not the $10 shipping. Buyer beware**	2015-08-11

I have many pairs of Tom's shoes and they are all the same size.  This is the first time I ordered them on line and the shoes are too narrow.  In fact, the right fits much tighter than the left.  I am pondering returning them, as I'm not sure I want to take a chance on them stretching.

I bought these boots for casual use on snow skiing trips, not for work purposes, so my comments about them are given in that context.  The boots are indeed waterproof.  Having stomped around in ankle-depth snow, no moisture has ever penetrated the soles or the leather.  Also, they keep my feet warm (although they are not fleece lined).  In my opinion, the boots are too heavy for casual use.  I ordered the B width and they seem to be wider than a true B.  Nonetheless, they are well-constructed, they suit the purposes for which I bought them and I will continue to use them.	2015-08-11

You can barely see the reading magnification. They feel comfortable and light. They do not have flexible hinges but they spread easily and bounce back with no problem so far. Although you need to be careful to doing it just to get them in and out. The frame have a plastic feel but do not look cheap. For the price and the bi-focal option for reading makes them a very good for those wanting that.Will update review once I wear them for longer period of time and get a feel for durability and comfort.They are polarized	2015-08-11

This clutch came to the rescue! The size is good enough to carry around basic needs (phone, wallet, make-up, small notebook, etc) and the design of it is so simplistic that it just works well. Plus, black goes with everything.<br /><br />And I actually have the molasses and poppy color of these bags and use them daily, so I know how durable these products can be.<br /><br />If you're in a rut and just want a clutch that has a clean design and size, this is the one to get!	2015-08-11

I received this product complementary for review purposes, all opinions are our own unbiased thoughts and opinions.	2015-08-11

Great support in the arch, excellent impact protection in the heel. All round very good shoe. It still remains to be seen if this shoe will last and stand up to the punishment that the CJ81s did, but I figured for $85usd I had to give it a shot.	2015-08-11

I received two of the same brand and models of shoes, but the left one was a 10 2E and the right was a 104E, I have no idea how that happened.. The right one fit perfectly and wasn't too narrow it had great arch support and absorbed shock perfectly. The left one was too snug and hurt after while of wearing them around the house. As expected I returned them to Amazon who glad had UPS pick them up and issued a refund. I ended up purchasing them locally so I wouldn't have the same, I'm sure RARE thing happen to me again. The ones I bought locally were heavenly and fit perfectly and the 4E is great for my wide foot. I have ran over 20 miles in them and my feet feel great.	2015-08-11

These sunglasses are very nice just as other reviews have said.  I was very surprised for the low price.  These are comfortable on the face and come with a nice case and cleaning cloth also.  The blue tinted lense is striking, perfect for a KC Royals fan.  I was concerned the blue tint would skew scenery.  But, the blue actually enhances natural colors and is not distracting to look through.  Get a pair while they still have them.	2015-08-11

I am an avid hiker, going almost every weekend for the last four years.  These are easily the best hiking shoes I've owned.  They're incredibly light - you barely feel like you're wearing shoes!  They're also durable, I've worn them over rocky, roots, muddy, etc. terrain.  I get great traction in them, except in extreme mud (for which I wear microspikes).  Even after wading through water, they dry quickly with the mesh fabric.  With the amount I hike, they last about a year, which I consider a long time.  I will continue to buy these!	2015-08-11

These shoes are one of the few basic articles of clothing I will purchase more than one of in the exact same size and color because you just can't have too many at the price.

I even ran mine (black) through the washing machine on hot (though I don't recommend this) and they came out looking just fine. I'm usually a 7.5, sometimes an 8 (I have a wide toe box), but the 7 fit me perfectly. If you're in between sizes, I would round down. They fit as most other reviewers are describing. These are the fitted black v-neck of shoes. Goes with almost everything, you can dress up or down, and you can always use more than one.	2015-08-11

It turned out to be the one thing I was most grateful to have with me. This was a perfect daypack and I ended up using it almost every day. I know there were some reviewers complaining about the placement of the straps, but I had no issues with it, despite the fact that I filled the bag up all the way. I was able to hold an iPad, book, passport, wallet, water bottle, snacks, travel pillow and more, and it was still quite comfy to wear for long periods of time. I wish there was a pocket on the inside as well to hold some small things, but that's my only critique. If you are using it for travel, just remember that it's not theft proof (it's not advertised to be so that shouldn't come as a shock). Any time I was concerned about theft, I just wore the bag in front of me.	2015-08-11

These shoes are very comfortable for everyday wear.  They can be worn with a dress, or with a casual shorts and t-shirt look.  My only negative is that they do not have significant arch support.  The soles are very soft (actually made out of yoga mats), but I walk most of the day in my hospital job, and with plantar fasciitis, I need a bit more arch support than these provide.  I love them, and I wear them around for everyday needs and occasionally at work.  However, I have to alternate them with some other shoes that provide better arch support for all-day wear.	2015-08-11

And I am 65 years old	I received my Savvycents wallet last week, (Teal Chevron) and I am so pleased with this item that I will definitely purchase another one soon!  It far exceeds any other &#34;similar&#34; wallets.  The quality of the wallet is superb, the size allows for cash, receipts, loyalty cards etc.  I especially like the slots for coins, dividers for different spending categories,  (fuel, groceries, grandchildren, misc. etc), slot for a pen, and the pull out cloth handle to keep the wallet around your wrist is an added bonus.  I set the wallet up so that my loyalty cards that are specific to the categories can be found in the little pouch within the dividers.  My first shopping trip with the Savvycents Wallet was successful.  It is more of an organizer tome which is important when trying to keep track of spending.  I encourage everyone to try this wallet, you will not be disapointed.	2015-08-11

I have pretty wide feet so it took about three days for the shoe to give in to the fact that my pinky toe wasn't going anywhere, it was the same on my first pair and just like then after a week these things are SO comfortable to put on.<br /><br />My old pair had really chopped up toes by the time I was done with them, this pair has already taken some hits so I went ahead and ordered an epoxy to shield up the toe.  This is a recommendation more than a knock on the boot - when you have a safety toe the leather is going to get a beating.<br /><br />Personally I don't like the feel of the laces it comes with so I swap them out for some longer 63&#34; paracord laces so I can tie the boots in my own special way, but that's just me.  What is pretty cool is there's sort of a cinch on the eyelet right at your ankle which locks in the laces after you pull them tight, keeping them snug while you tie them up.<br /><br />The anti fatigue feature is great at first but definitely falls off over the life of the boot, I think I had my old pair for about two years and at the end I was slipping some new soles in to keep my legs comfortable.  I don't count this against the boots, wear and tear is absolutely expected and 2 years is a good lifespan to me.  As for the ladder hooking design in the treads, ehhh.  Kind of a gimmick to me.  Admittedly I don't spend a ton of time on extension ladders but really I've never thought to myself, &#34;I wish someone made a boot that made ladders easier to stand on.&#34;  Also if anything having the middle of your foot bear the weight, as opposed to the toe or heel, is kinda uncomfortable after a short amount of time.<br /><br />What my real gripe is, and why this is a 4 star review, is that out of the box there was some separation between the treads and the leather on either side of both boots.  Not cool.  This was NOT present on my old pair until the end of their life so I thought nothing of it then.

The only downside of wearing sneakers was that my feet did get uncomfortably hot after a while, but that could have been de to my choice of sock or the fact that I was walking around 8 miles a day in over 90 degree heat.

I thought I'd give the Saucony Stabil a try -- seeing that they were also available in a wide width and promised much of the same type of support and stability for my flat, over-pronating feet.  I just wore them last weekend for working a boys showcase tournament -- two U15 games and the U16 and U19 finals and I found my feet were rather sore just behind the toes.  I removed the innersoles and discovered that they are incredibly cheap and flimsy compared to those that come with the Brooks Beast (which have innersoles providing gel comfort from toe to heel).  I have replaced the Saucony innersoles with some from an old pair of Brooks, I can already tell that they are much more comfortable.  So, basically if you buy these, you may want to factor in the cost of a decent pair of orthotics in with the cost!	2015-08-11

Sale price was $99.00 so I totally expected a decent pair of shoes. Reviews were good so I decided to go with the Dansko Elise sneaker.  I decided to give them a try thinking they would get better with some wear but has not. I am so ready for a different pair of work shoes. The toe area is painful where the shoes bend. My legs ache  before the end of my work shift. My ankle hurts probably because the shoe is to loose.  I work in child nutrition and I am on my feet all day. I  have a Morton Neuroma so I needed a shoe with a rounded toe..This shoe has to much room in the toe area and does not fit my foot as expected. I really wish the shoe would have worked. I am going to ask for a refund and this time I try the shoe on before I purchase.	2015-08-11

Boots fit great they are extremely comfortable the only thing negative I have to say is that when I purchase something online I expect it to be exactly the same as the image online. My boots came unlaced and one was missing the little gotetex badge for the laces (left boot) and the other (right one) had the little Badge once again nothing crazy just a little detail I mean they are work boots I didn't buy them to look pretty, but from a company that's motto is they pay attention to the finer details Someone missed a cup Joe the day these where shipped out.

[[VIDEOID:fed116a0c24446b59d20596f9e01eb27]]I'm not sure I can adequately describe how much I love this purse.  BG has always impressed me with the quality of their bags, and this one is no exception...but seriously, this bag is amazing!  I got it in the dark green, and it just looks absolutely stunning with the brown and gold accents.  I'm not always a huge fan of straps on a purse, and prefer to use the shoulder strap, so I love the fact that you can not only adjust these straps, but you can remove them too!<br /><br />The quality is outstanding.  I love the silky material used inside the purse and it looks amazing.  The design of this purse is pretty fantastic.  It has one zipper pocket on the front, but the inside has THREE different compartments, which I love! I also love the fact that you can zipper the entire purse shut.  Sometimes my purse is such a hot mess that I'm embarrassed for anyone to see inside it, and this is perfect because I can just zipper it closed and no one has to realize what a mess I am. I also like it as a safety feature.  When I'm out at the store I prefer to keep my purse zippered shut.  I have a fear of people just reaching into my bag and grabbing my wallet and this isn't a concern when it's zippered shut.<br /><br />I can not say enough good things about this purse and the brand.  The purse came in a dust cover, which I love because it keeps my purse in excellent condition when I switch out to a different purse.  The purse also comes with a scented satchel that you can leave in or take out!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	2015-08-11

The first pair lasted a about 3 days. Boot started infiltrating water on the right side if the right boot right at where the little waterproof tag is. Talk about irony. Got a replacement pair and as I write this I'm sitting in my work truck with another drenched right foot. Water infiltrates into the second pair of boots at the same spot. To clarify, I had my boot in about 5 inches of water. I felt that cold spot on my foot and took my boot off, turned it upside down and a bunch of water poured out. Comfortable boot though! Oh and one more thing. That black toe heats up fast in the summer sun.  More disappointing than reading about politicians.	2015-08-11

We had our identities stolen  a couple years back when we were in Las Vegas. If I would have had this purse with me instead of the cheapo non protective purse I was using, my identity would have never been stolen. I definitely recommend this for every day use not just traveling. It is a cute purse on top of all its safety RFID features. I am in love with this purse and will be looking into more products by this company in the future.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased honest review.	2015-08-11

These flip-flops are wearable but not comfortable; they are attractive and seem well made, but they don't fit my foot very well. The straps are very tall (the toe thong is too long and the straps are too far from the insole), so they don't rest on my instep and therefore the shoe flops around and tends to fall off my foot, or lets my foot lift out the back. The bottom is completely flat and provides almost no arch support and the sole is a little too wide. I'm disappointed because my other pair of Reef flip-flops fit perfectly and provide good support.	2015-08-11

I would have given this purse two stars but I do like it. However, this purse does not look like it's worth the $88.00 Amazon has it listed for much less the $188.00 Lucky Bags has on the price tag ! Fortunatly for me I ordered with 20% off for Prime Members and even with this discount the purse is overprice for the look of it. Put it this way, if I had seen this in the store I would have paid no more for it than between 40-50 dollars. I've seen equally and better looking leather purses in T.J. Maxx ! I have purchased a Lucky bag in November from Amazon so I know what a great looking bag from Lucky looks like. This one was not on the same level ! It could be that the purse would look better in another color sometimes that happens. I ordered the black so I could carry with more outfits. I thinking of sending this back and I may not order another purse from Amazon. Time will tell.	2015-08-11

I say shoe because they do cover more of the foot than many sandals..I can see these being used for water shoes, slippers, going out with friends..anything you want.  they are a really good looking sandal and could be used for even dressier situations.  my favorite was the neutral/gray color which is very classy looking.  could not find it in my size (10).  bought in in 9.5 and had to send them back.  I usually wear a sizes smaller in sandals, but these cover the toes, so the half size smaller i ordered were just a bit small.  these run true to your normal size.  the keen cnx I bought were fine in 9.5, even though I wear a size 10 shoe.  I found the uneek on another site in size 10 (though not in grey/neutral) and bought 4 pair, 2 brown, and 2 blue/grey.  once you wear them, you will not want to wear anything else.	2015-08-11

Very pretty color.  They are comfy, but after wearing them around the house awhile, I noticed a few differences. 1. This shoe is about a half size longer than the original (more shoe behind my heel) 2. The band around the foot is slightly larger (the band only barely touches my foot at the distal edge, and gaps at the proximal edge), 3. Perhaps because the toe of the shoe is too large my foot slides forward and my toe occasionally touches the toe of the shoe (the deal breaker), and 4. The sole of the original shoe appears to be a cushy/firm leather material, but he sole of this pink shoe is a cushy/firm foam material, softer and less arch support than the original.<br />These will be going back. Haven't yet decided if I will try a smaller size.  If my toe hadn't touched the end of the shoe I probably would have kept them.	2015-08-11

Normally, Sperry's are a bit wide for me (I have narrow heels) and I have to adjust the laces around the back to keep them on.  Usually on the Sperry Bahama Top-Sider I also put an insole with arch support in.<br /><br />These fit me right out of the box, a little loose, but still comfortable.  They are wide enough in the toe box (i.e., not narrow) but the heel fits great.  There isn't great arch support, but a slight arch.<br /><br />The laces could be adjusted for slightly narrower or for wider feet.  You could put low socks on if you wanted, but I find they are really comfortable to just slide into.<br /><br />They are really cute and totally comfortable.  I now have them in pink, gray, navy and white.	2015-08-11

I bought these as replacements due to one of my original RayBan lenses getting cracked and chipped. They did fit the frames snugly and accurately, but they are also plastic and not in the same league as the original glass lenses. The polarization appears to be a little off as well compared to the original glass lenses as things like my phone screen seem to have a smeared multicolored haze on them. This goes away when I remove the sunglasses. With any other polarized lenses, if a screen is dark, rotating it 90 degrees will solve the problem. All in all, these lenses are just OK and will do the job until I either find some reasonably prices glass replacements or replace the sunglasses altogether.	2015-08-11

It was somewhat painful to be honest.  I put a pair of think winter socks on and walked for an hour in this shoes.  They loosened up and feel wonderful now.  Due to the height of the shoe on your foot in reference to your ankle it has to stay tight to your foot and therefore is a little smaller in that area to keep the shoe from slipping.  At first I was going to send them back, however, a suggestion was to use the thick socks and &#34;stretch&#34; them out a little.  It worked!	2015-08-11

That's the ONLY reason I'm not returning them.*  Well, that plus I don't want to pay return postage on a pair of inexpensive shoes.<br />Let me run down a Pro and Con list for these shoes; you can decide on your own if they're worth it to you.  My stats: I'm kinda old to be wearing ridiculous shoes like this, but I am a daily heel wearer of 3&#34; - 4&#34;.  Not a novice.  I have size 7 feet; they're a little wide but not so much that I need a special shoe width usually.<br />PROS: Beautiful.  Really, these are very, very colorful and fun to look at.<br />For a cheap knock-off, the quality is fairly good.  The studs are evenly placed, the stitching is even, and there's minimal glue marks.  The buckle stays in place.<br />They're made out of cloth.  Not that awful faux suede, nor a too-shiny satin.  The fabric looks like a cotton sateen but is most likely a poly.<br />I have to say it again - the shoes are gorgeous.<br />CONS: Hideously uncomfortable.  I'm used to a high heel, but these shoes were not designed well in terms of angle and balance.  They're meant to be sitting-in-a-restaurant shoes, not dancing-at-the-club shoes.  Or really, they're posing-for-your-blog shoes.  I work at an office with minimal walking (like, to the copier and back) and I had to take them off mid morning and put on my spare flats.<br />Cheap materials; these shoes should have one more buckle closure in order to optimize the fit and comfort.  They only have one, so you have to do a weird foot and ankle contortion to get your foot in the shoe.  If you have thicker ankles, you may be out of luck even if the shoes technically fit.<br /><br />So, if you're desperate to find a Rockstud 1970's dupe to photograph for your blog or your Insta, I guess this is your pair.  If you want a shoe to actually wear and walk in, keep looking.  I don't mind cheap shoes, I've worn plenty a Payless.  But these are just beautiful torture devices.<br />*I bought one of those wall-mounted shelf/box things.  These shoes are now a lovely conceptual art piece in my office.  Everyone admires how beautiful they are, so I guess I got my money's worth after all.ted shelf/box things.  These shoes are now a lovely conceptual art piece in my office.

The neutral colors go with everything, the heel height makes it dressy, and the ankle strap and chunky heel provide extra support and eliminate wobbling.

I have the exact pair of shoes in solid black that I purchased from Macy's at the beginning of the summer. I loved them so much that I wanted the white/tan pair also and when I seen that they were $45 dollars cheaper from this seller I couldn't resist. The turn lock on the straps come undone randomly throughout the day, which makes the straps fall off your ankle. It seems as though the turn locks are &#34;loose&#34; and I don't think there is any way to tighten them up. It's quite annoying to be walking down the street and having to stop and re fasten your shoe! I don't think I'll be wearing them very often, which is extremely disappointing because they are so cute for summer and very comfortable. I guess the cheaper price tag wasn't such a bargain after all!	2015-08-11

Been using as a light hiker for work (1-4 miles) in mountainous terrain. Using wool socks. NO blister issues or rubbing so far. The sole is thick enough that sharp out crops are not an issue but not so thick that you can't feel the ground. Its also does well on wet rocks. The ventilation keeps it from being a water proof shoe but after a couple sprays of water repellant handles light drizzles with no problem.  In all, a well made boot that exceeds the notion of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;	2015-08-11

My shoe use consists of running, usually about 15 minutes of sprints and 45 minutes of jogging on a track 5 days a week and running trails once a week. I wasn't a huge fan of Reebok shoes I've tried in the past, but I've been pleasantly surprised with this pair; they offer good support, and one you get used to the way the shoe feels, are quite comfortable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good durability despite soft material on the soles and a mesh upper.<br />Comfortable once you get used to the unique feelings.<br />Cushions the impact of running; the bottoms of my feet seem to have less muscle soreness in these shoes than most others.<br />Wide Enough. I have fairly wide and tall feet and these fit fine in my normal size. If you have muscular feet, you might notice touching on the side like I did at first, but that goes away rather quickly.<br /><br />Cons:<br />A bit long. Not so much that it gets in the way, but you can feel it.<br />Stuff gets stuck in these shoes. If you run trails, a lot of stuff.<br />Arch support could be better, but it's there. I'd sat it's better than your average running shoe, but not as good as say a tennis shoe.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I'd recommend this shoe if you can get it for the right price. I wouldn't pay $60+, but for the sale price of $28 that I got it for it's an excellent shoe.	2015-08-11

The shoes are comfortable and soft - no question. However, they dangle on my average-width feet.  The back loop (that wraps around the heel) is made for a very very large foot. The front strap is somewhat too long to keep the shoe to the foot.  I had to tie the ankle strap almost uncomfortably tight to keep these from dangling and sliding from under me.  Other Frye shoes fit me well - this one - a major miss.	2015-08-11

No 'break in\" necessary!"	As soon as I got clearance from DON that non-white shoes were allowed,I sought out something fun.  I had a white Timberland shoe just like this and wanted to stay  with it.  I LOVE these!  They actually arrived on a Sunday morning.  I pulled them out of the box and put them on my barefoot.. I couldn't wait and had been wearing sandals. Anyways, I felt like I had to push my foot in.  I was bummed because I thought I would have to return them.  Monday, work day, came and I decided to try them out anyway.  A nice thin pair of cotton socks, and an extra pair of shoes were in my bag as I did not expect to be able to wear these all day long. I was PLEASANTLY surprised!  I was able to COMFORTABLY WEAR my new Timberlands ALL DAY! with no trouble at all.  Light as a feather, snug where they need to be.  I have no idea what this &#34;anti-fatigue&#34; thing is, but it works!  I can't wait to start my Timberland collection!	2015-08-11

Its a great way to protect your phone from getting scratched by other items in your bag.  As the compartments are separated by two layers of the faux leather instead of just fabric, it provides MUCH better protection than most bags.  The color is great but it is a little darker than what is pictured.  More like a royal blue.  I also really like the heart pattern.<br /><br />Now for the Negatives.  First of all, there are no credit card slots or small zippered pockets for cash.  I think this is a major oversight and really limits the usefulness of this wristlet.  Second, is the zipper buttons clang together when you walk and make a tinging, bell like sound.  Its a little annoying and its made worse by if you have a tendency to swing your arms or talk with your hands.  Finally, I'm not really sure what the symbols on the zippers mean...lol	2015-08-11

I am very hard on hiking boots and laces.  I have been very disappointed in the past with laces that were oversold as tough and then performed same as Kiwi brand.  I found IronLace to be very tough, but also tough on my fingers.  Of all the laces I have tried, I like these the best.  They show no signs of fraying after many many miles of alpine hiking, and they are also gentle to the touch.  Update:  Many more miles, still no fraying.  And I lace my boots tight.  Buy these!  Update:  One year and I am still on the first pair with no fraying.  Best laces by far I have ever tried.	2015-08-11

I currently have several different pairs of sandals: ripcurls, oneille, reef!!  Each one of the &#34;higher end&#34; sandals I own, have some sort of defect with them.  The ripcurls tear where your feet rub over a short period of time.  My oneill pair has symbols pop off easy.  The reefs even have issues, the strap portion that goes over your foot will break down and the design will crack & fade.  These flojos are the best pair of sandals I have.  They don't breakdown where your foot rubs on them, the straps are well made and won't break easy like some others I've owned.  These are literally the only pair of sandals I can wear all day walking in, soft base and durability construction.  The &#34;boutique&#34; brands I own are not nearly as comfortable.  The only pair of the 3 other brands I own would be the reefs in terms of comfort & walkability.	2015-08-11

The sand didn't gunk up inside them at all.<br /><br />The fit and adjustment for these shoes was very convenient and comfortable.  My wife was really surprised how comfortable the foot-bed was.  These were actually really comfortable to walk around in, even when we weren't on the river.<br /><br />These also had better treads that the sandals that I bought for myself and others in my family.

I own a considerable amount of holographic silver leather items, and by far this one is the most vibrant. It's extremely linear and smooth, not to mention very large. I was afraid of getting a thin, small clutch-- it's more like a short messenger bag. Has good pockets and wrist strap too.<br />The chain was a little hard to find... it's in the middle pocket in a tiny bag. The chain is also a little short for me (5'5&#34;) as I wanted it to function as a crossbody. However, it's not made to be one, so no complaint there. I simply attached a second chain to add length. Another problem that should be expected is, if you put too much into the purse, it won't close and the chain will put a lot of stress on your shoulder. The bigger and softer the strap, the easier it is to distribute weight. Since the chain is thin and hard, it should only be expected to hurt using too much weight. I might try and find a thicker crossbody strap. But for most people, the strap should be fine! On me, using it like a normal purse, the bag reaches my hips. Since my hips are also considerable, this would make pushing past people in halls difficult. So again, for my own personal needs, I might exchange straps. Good buy, though! I love it!	2015-08-11

It's only been a year and three months since purchase.  When I bought Birkenstocks back in the early 90s, I wore them for almost a decade before the leather failed.  I'm very disappointed in this purchase.<br /><br />Update - Longevity test fails.<br /><br />After only three months, the cork is cracking and falling apart on the heel of the left sandal, and the glue is giving way that holds the upper to the cork/side.<br /><br />These are not the Birks I remember. I spent a lot of money for a pair of sandals that I could have got at the dollar store.<br />------------------------------------------<br />I chose the Birko-Flor due primarily to price; they are significantly less expensive than the leather version. I was skeptical, but after wearing them for a couple of weeks (and I mean everyday, all day), I've come to really appreciate them.  They have everything the leather version offers - the quality, the comfort and fit, etc. - but at a more wallet friendly price.<br /><br />We'll see about the longevity. My previous pair (essentially the leather version of what I have now) lasted almost a decade before I had to toss them. I'm curious as to whether these will provide the same long wear...<br /><br />So far, so good.	2015-08-11

The stitching quality is terrible.  I purchased two pair for my husband since they are his favorite shoe.  They fit perfect!!  The first time he wore each pair the stitching unraveled.  This has never happened before when I've purchased from local retailers.  I thought maybe it was a fluke when it happened to the first pair which I returned.  He just tried this pair (the second pair) and the same thing happened.  He is not hard on shoes.  Normally they last him a year!!!  I am returning this second pair now.  Very disappointed.  Will not buy these on line again even though they are supposed Brand name and look identical.	2015-08-11

They do look good.  And they come with a handy little carry bag.<br /><br />Most important for me was the good fit with a 14mm bridge. My nose is quite narrow and somewhat deep set so most average size (or no size listed) readers just skip down my nose or fall off.  So happy these stay on.<br /><br />The &#34;but&#34;... the wires that the nose pads fit to seem very soft, my impression while adjusting width between pads. So I've been very careful with then, though I am typically pretty rough on readers.<br /><br />Bottom line - if readers tend to slip off your nose, try these.  Just don't sit on them (note to self).	2015-08-11

I wear a size 8 - 8.5 women's shoe.<br /><br />These were my third pair of Fivefingers but unfortunately they didn't fit.  I ordered the same size as my two prior pairs, that is size 39, and the Alitza Loop fit great EXCEPT for the pinky toe.  The pinky toe housing was too short and too narrow.  All other toes fit normally, but I couldn't even straighten out my pinky toe in the tiny space allotted for it.  Please note, I have slender feet and short toes and a very small pinky toe so this really didn't make any sense.<br /><br />I was committed to owning these so I exchanged the 39's for 40's and same problem.  With the 40's the regular toes were too long and pinky toe space was still too small to straighten out my small pinky toe.<br /><br />Normal Alitza fit me perfectly in size 39, but Alitza Loop in 39 and 40 - I could barely get my pinky toe in much less move efficiently in these.  Sadly, they had to go back.  :,(	2015-08-11

I haven't worn them out walking but if they don't wear comfortably all day I'll be very surprised and disappointed.  The fit is narrower than many boots but perfect for me.  I have a high arch so I got orthotic inserts but had to have the shoe man thin it out from the ball to the toe.  I don't have skinny calves but there was just enough room, allowing for socks and (sometimes) pants.  Check le chameau website for calf measurement if that's a concern. By way of comparison:  they replace a pair of Lacrosse boots which of course I could only get in men's but they run narrow as men's boots go.  I still had to wear extremely thick socks as my feet were swimming in them (especially after they started leaking :).<br /><br />They'll earn five stars if they hold up.	2015-08-11

I bought these to wear for my job.

Less than 3 weeks after wearing them, the sole started to separate from the tip of the shoe (on BOTH shoes).  The amount I paid for these isn't worth it.  I returned them within a month of usage.

The latest trend in shoe comfort is definitely the stretch upper.  I love this great sporty slip-on for its comfort. This show has a hand woven stretch elastic upper that provides added give making it easy to get on and off.  Not to mention when its hot out and I'm running errand that have me walking across hot parking lots, that give helps my feet as they always swell a bit in the heat.  Plus, it boasts a memory foam foot bed and extra padding at the heel for supreme comfort, which leads to all day comfort that I love. Breathable mesh sock liner keeps my feet cool and dry. The flexible, rubber outsole is very secure when walking.  The other day I walked through a spill on the grocery store floor and didn't realize it until the woman behind me slipped.	2015-08-11

He wore these for about 5 hours and had blisters.  The foot strap is snug.  His feet are bigger than mind and if I slip my foot into them the straps hug my women's size 8 foot rather well.  So bottom line is we hope the strap stretches out.  We've never had this issue with any of his other reefs for over a decade.	2015-08-11

These boots are tall and do not have a zipper therefore you have to shimmy your foot down the shaft of the boot to get it on.... IF you can.  I could not in my size and back they went to Amazon.  I ordered a 1/2 size up and I was able to SQUEEZE my feet into them, then the heel area was a little loose and slipped a bit.  I know you can wear thicker socks but I probably  would not be able to get my feet through the boot shaft. I wore them only a couple of hours before they became unbearable. They are very stiff and there is no arch support in this style.  I was surprised that they were marked &#34;Made In Mexico&#34;.  I always thought that Frye was made in America.  I love the look of the boot and plan to take them to a shoe shop to get them stretched widthwise. I hope this helps.  I thought Amazon had free returns. I was charged additional money when I returned my first pair to exchange even though they were the exact same price. All my other Frye boots have been so comfortable from the start ....IF these boots were not on clearance I would send them back again but the discounted price is letting me give them a 3rd chance!  :)	2015-08-11

I tried them on at a couple different local retailers but they wanted $120 plus for these! So I looked them up here and the prices are way more reasonable.  The fit and finish on these are incredible, I have a pretty big head and I can wear these all day long without discomfort and the lenses just have to be experienced.  If you are on the fence, just do it!	2015-08-11

I work where there are concrete floors and I am on my feet ALL day! So a little advice, add work/athletic insoles to the boots and you will be fine! Plus, these boots are half off the retail price! And remember, your feet have to adjust to walking in them, then they'll feel like they're supposed to lol Anyway, hope they last me as long as the first pair!	2015-08-11

Even with it's slim design, it has several pockets that help with some organization of our stuff.  The leather is soft and has a great feel.  I've had multiple slim crossover bags and I've given them all away.  Either they don't open wide enough and I can't rummage around, or they bulge when things are put inside, or there aren't additional spaces to keep things separated.  I love that this bag has two outside pockets.  And, utilizing them takes nothing away from the sleek look of the bag.  It's really a beautiful design and keeps it shape so well.  I've got it all in there....check book, wallet, keys, extra makeup, hand cream, cell phone, etc.  And, it doesn't look like it's bursting its seams.  Love it!!!	2015-08-11

I have these same MBT shoes in the SAME size in black & they fit perfectly.  I love the black shoes in this style & still wear them.  Since I got the black ones, they have lowered the toe box on the tan shoes & have & made them more narrow in the toes. Thus, they do not fit in my size. I had to return them.  I then ordered the size 9 (I normally wear a 6.5 in sandals and 7.0-7.5 in closed toe shoes) and the toes are perfect, but the &#34;last&#34; (shoe lingo for shoe shape and volume) has been changed and no longer fits a normal foot.  So, get a larger size than you normally wear.  They are a really great shoe if they fit.  They have ruined these shoes with the new last.	2015-08-11

The shoes are great EXCEPT, the right one has some threads that have been melted/cut that rub on the top of my right foot.  I have attempted to trim/sand it.  It is better, but I can still feel it.  It really doesn't matter, I wear Keen & Icebreaker wool short socks when I wear them and all is well.  I have worn them all day swimming/climbing/walking down creeks for a couple weekends now without an issue.  The tread is aggressive, but they will still slip on some slick rocks in the creek bed.  It would be nice if the sole was a little more conforming to rocks to make them grip better, but I think they are stiffer to protect your foot.  Don't misunderstand, they flex very well for a shoe, they would just grip better if the sole was more pliable.  Its hard to find the right configuration; there are always trade-offs for any gain.  I have narrow feet and the fit/lace well.  Also, unlike cheap water shoes, the sole stays in place when you walk/hike!<br /><br />All-in-all, these are a great pair of water shoes!	2015-08-11

I originally ordered 46 (European) which should be 12 American.  This is the size I normally wear.  I've never bought anything bigger than 46.  When the original 46 size were fractionally too small, I exchanged them for 46.5 (which normally would be enough).  When they arrived that felt EXACTLY the same size.  I have now returned the 46.5 shoes and ordered a pair of 47's - for the first time in my life.	2015-08-11

I normally wear a size 7.5, but I read other reviews of the short version of this boot and went down to a size 7. That size was perfect for my feet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the boot shaft is far, far too narrow. The description says 14 inches, but it's about 12 inches. I can typically fit into Miz Mooz boots (which are notorious for having a narrow shaft), so I didn't think these would be a problem. If it wasn't for the narrowness, I would have kept them. They're so cute! But just putting them on caused bruises on my legs at the top of the shaft of the boot. Such a shame. :(	2015-08-11

When I first saw them I was afraid they'd be too small because they're a little shorter than the other shoes I was wearing. But the length is perfect. They are slightly tighter than I'd like in front due to being thin vertically, but I don't think it's a big deal and hope they loosen up once I break them in. They look beautiful. They are noisy and sound heavy on my hardwood floor, but I don't mind too much. Oh! And the best part... I didn't think they were going to be good for dancing when I ordered them but when I started walking the first thing I noticed was that they glide easily. These are going to be fantastic for dancing! I am a partner dancer. I bought these for work, but now I am afraid they're too nice! But for the price, I could order another pair easily. I'll update if I have any unreasonable problems.<br /><br />I am normally about 7.5 or anywhere between 7 and 8. I ordered 7.5. This is def the right size. :) the box has a size chart on it which is diff from Amazon. It says US 7.5 and 8.0 = Euro 39.<br /><br />I am tomboyish and don't normally buy pretty shoes, but these are really pretty without being too feminine for my tastes. Somehow.<br /><br />Update: After wearing these to work, I have to say they are slightly too small. My little toe is hurting a little because there's very little wiggle room. I'm still hoping that they will break in and be more comfortable. Or my feet will get used to them. My feet are normal width, maybe slightly on the narrow side. These shoes could use slightly more width for me. The thing is, when I am walking, my feet slide to the front of the shoe, and this makes them feel smaller in the front. Also I am wearing mismatched black socks and the left one keeps sliding down on the foot - it doesn't do that with any of my other shoes. If anyone knows of any socks that don't slide down with these shoes, please let me know!<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars because these are great for the price and the wrong size isn't exactly their fault. If I were to order another pair, I might order size 8 or 7.5W. I don't plan on sending these ones back as it's too much trouble and the sizing on these so far isn't too bad.ong size isn't exactly their fault.

The style is very cool, and they appear quite well made.  I wanted them to work for me because I fell in love with them--they spoke to me.  Only they were very, very wide, giving me what I call visually unattractive &#34;toe sprawl.&#34;  I tried an insert to take up the slack to stop my toes from separating out but still had too much room.  Normally, I order a 5.5 B in shoes/sandals.  I read that Bed Stu runs small, so I ordered the 6.  The length is a fit, but the width was way huge (for me).  As I tried them on at home, I felt they offered arch support and were quite comfortable.  I seriously wanted to keep these sandals!  If you have a wide foot like a &#34;C,&#34; not a &#34;B&#34; width, these should fit you.  They are so very cute and stylish!	2015-08-11

The straps of the thong are close to the sole so it makes for a snug fit, yet the toe end sticks almost 2 inches out beyond the end of my toes. So they are kind of long. Keeps your feet warm even though they are open at the toe and heel. The texture is not &#34;fuzzy&#34;, it is thick soft velour. A luxury for your feet. Good buy at $21. I will be buying one in another color. Bought black the first time because I knew I would wear them outside and get them dirty. The black ones are perfect for that.	2015-08-11

I find them far more comfortable than running shoes, but not as geared toward weight training specifically. These are more of a cross trainer shoe than a lifting shoe, so if buying specifically for squats I would skip these; however, if you are like me and don't want to lug multiple pairs of shoes to the gym for each workout, these are great for short length HIIT and supportive for weights. I do use these during all weight exercises, including squats and they are significantly more stable than standard running/walking shoes and were more affordable than chucks (which many people use, but I find uncomfortable for HIIT). They had a bit more space in the toe area than I was used to but I decided to keep them rather than size down and I actually find it comfortable and it leaves room for a shoe insert. These come with a sort of memory foam interior and mine had a small crease in one side that was very uncomfortable. I like to use arch supports in my shoes so I just covered the insert with an additional arch support and they are perfect!	2015-08-11

I love the appearance of the Fit Flop as well as the other styles that are available. They are also very good when it comes to shock absorption and a sole that offers slip resistance.

These are excellent sunglasses for the money. They seem well made, are reasonably sturdy and are cheap enough that you don't need to treat them as precious. If (like my wife) you find yourself constantly loosing sunglasses, or throwing them in your purse/glovebox/cup holder where they get scratched, these are great because when they are (inevitably) lost or damaged you can just buy a new pair.<br /><br />The glasses are light, and comfortable to wear, and do a good job cutting out the light. The frames seem well made and are reasonably durable (especially for the price). All in all, a great pair of cheap sunglasses. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-11

I purchased these in tortoise, although it was a hard decision between those and burgundy.  I am very picky when it comes to sunglasses.  They really have to fit well or I won't wear them, so I was a little worried about buying them without getting to try them on,  but these are so nice and fit so well.  They don't pinch behind your ears ( I get a headache from that) ,  yet they are tight enough so they don't fall forward when you bend over.  The polarized lenses make all the difference in the world.  I have adrenal problems and it causes my eyes to be very sensitive to the glare from the sun.  It's not always a problem,  but sometimes when I'm driving and the sun is really bright ,  I have to squint so much that my eyes are almost closed....especially when there are a lot of cars around to reflect the sun.  With polarized lenses,  the glare is not just diminished,  but eliminated. So for me,  it's not just about finding a pair that I like the way they look and fit,  but if they have polarized lenses.  These check off all of those marks for me.  I love them.<br />I received a discount to purchase these in exchange for an honest review....and they are awesome !!	2015-08-11

I failed to notice that these shoes were made of man-made materials (and not leather) until after I placed the order. Oh well, I thought.

And I was perfectly comfortable all night long. So, I'm not going to return them. They look great and no one but me knows they're not leather.

I ruined those when I went into the Dead Sea with them.  My issue with these Bare Traps is that though they mold to your foot, they become black on the bottom where your feet put the most pressure on, and it can turn your feet a bit black as well.  Also, the more you wear the shinier the black becomes, and it rubs my ball of foot in a way that will give a blister if I wear them all day.  And they also make my feet stink.  I've never had that problem with any other pair of flip flops.  So though they are comfortable, I am still looking for another pair to replace my Merrells.	2015-08-11

These boots are beautiful and not too streaky as I was worried about that. They are stiff enough that they can stand on their own however there is some slouch. The leather is smooth and of high quality. They are pretty true to size, I got an 8 and with thicker socks they're fine. My only reason for giving 4 stars is because I bought the boots at a certain price and they had dropped in price by almost $50 just two days later.	2015-08-11

Buy the slide.	2/1/16 Product update. The thong broke today! I was worried about the durability of that little piece of foam. I would NOT recommend these shoes even though Oofos customer service replaced them for me under warranty. The warranty is only 6 months and they would not exchange for the slide due to their warranty policy. There is no reinforcement in the thong. She also told me the shoes were only designed for about a 6 month life - if you are wearing daily.   Update 8/25//15. I definitely have been more willing to be more active with these shoes. The soreness has subsided somewhat, but there is no question the extra activity is contributing. Obviously, the goal was met  - I am more active in these shoes than I am in other shoes thanks to the support and comfort. The only question is, when will I be able to buy OOFOS dress and casual shoes with full leather uppers? They are probably too squishy to work well as active/athletic purposes.  Update 8/14. I lowered the review to 4 stars. My feet are a bit sore. I am not sure why, perhaps due to a bit more activity. These are still by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. However, I am concerned these aren't good for my plantar fasciitis. I will update the review in a few weeks to report any updates.  Original entry 8-10. Wow! I just got my Oofos yesterday and already I miss them!! I am at work, and unfortunately, I can't wear sandals with my suit. But if I could I would! These shoes are THAT GOOD! I have chronic plantar fasciitis and have tried everything except invasive surgery. Hopefully these shoes will make it more bearable. My Croc Comfort Clouds have been the best I have found, and I remember being very happy when I first got them. But they are EXTREMELY HOT look horrible, so I don't wear them much. I will update my review, hoping the joy continues.  I wish Oofos made inserts and/or casual and dress shoes. I will be FIRST on the list to buy! For now, I will wear my Oofos at every opportunity. I will begin a walking program powered by Oofos! I have been unable to walk much due to the pain, but I am hopeful these shoes help me get more active - which obviously will help with the overall condition.	2015-08-11

I actually have no complaints about the quality of the glasses.  As my eyes are very sensitive to brightness -not just sun- the extra bit of dark really does help filter out more of the light.  The only thing that would make it better for me would be having a bit of wrap around at the side to block out the peripheral light.  But that is only an occasional problem and I'm sure that would detract from the Gangster appeal.  :-)  Price was good and the glasses seem durable.

Measure your foot with a measuring tape in millimeters and ignore whatever else you would normally use as an indicator.

Anyway, perfect fit. Just measure your foot in millimeters and you should be good to go. Don't phone it in, either. Really get precise with your measurement for a perfect fit. Only gripe is that they looked like they would have a slightly green tint to them, but it's really grey under normal lighting conditions.	2015-08-11

US	16021164	RGT99RT0Z3TVU	B00KJEKZWK	455188337	Fossil Preston Colorblock Shoulder Bag	Shoes	5	0	0	N	Y	Stunning, Sophisticated, Stylish Bag--and Practical for Travel, Business, or Daily Use	I purchased this tote bag for a trek around France during the Summer.  I am naturally one of those people who carries a book (or two), notebook, pens, and other writing gear around, so I nearly always buy bags to accommodate my reading and writing habits (no Kindle for me--sorry, Amazon!).  In any case, since I also knew I'd be adding travel books, maps, and other &#34;travel&#34; items to my typical bag, not to mention a digital camera, I wanted something a bit more stylish for France and substantial in size for traveling.  I always prefer crossbody bags because they are easier to carry hands-free and are safer than a hand or shoulder bag.  Looking for versatility beyond traveling, I sought a good neutral-color bag that would not clash with any (or many) outfits.  This supple leather bag exceeds my expectations.  From the moment I arrived for pick-up by the travel van, my traveling companions (male and female) raved about this bag.  For ten days, they joked about stealing it when I fell asleep!  What makes it particularly attractive is the zipper that goes around the sides and bottom of the bag; when not packed full of necessities and whatnot, this tote (which looks more like a messenger bag or briefcase) can be zipped closed and used as a briefcase/folder-looking bag.  The sleeker silhouette is quite sophisticated and, overall, this bag and its color-blocked leather (camel and a slightly lighter leather at the top) is both practical and attractive.  Although the shoulder strap is a bit flimsier than I would have liked, it held up (to my surprise) after a week and a half of hauling the bag everywhere.  Finally, I like that, if you really need more room, you can pack the bag and not fold the flaps down over the purse.  This makes the tote a little taller and a bit less sleek or attractive, but if you're traveling home on a plane and simply need more room to stash souvenirs or extra items in your personal carry-on item, it sure comes in handy!  All in all, this bag held up well, is aesthetic perfection, will be versatile and useful for any kind of wardrobe, and is sure to make you the envy of the crowd.	2015-08-11

Usually thong flip flops are only good around the pool or on the balcony or in the house.  But these have arch supports which expand the wearing time considerably and some might wear all day.

With that being said it may be advisable to go up a half size or full size.  But you will never regret this purchase once they have fit comfortably to your feet.	2015-08-11

It's a little early for writing a review.  I read reviews before I purchased these shoes, as I have planters fasc. and have to wear good shoes.  These shoes are very comfortable with good support.  I am having to slowly break them in and wear them a couple hours at a time.  I have a blister on the back of my heel and have put pads in the back to help.  According to previous reviews, you have to give them a chance and get them broken in.  They are super cute shoes and I have received compliments when wearing them out.	2015-08-11

The quality is good for $13 shoes, but don't expect anything great. I did order half a size up, and I advise you to do so too, because shoes like these can be kind of narrow, if I had ordered my real size they would have been too tight for me. If you're looking to buying these or Toms i'd suggest you get these first and try them out, if you like the quality, you can get like 3 pairs for the price of what you get Toms for.	2015-08-11

The is the second pair of these boots I have purchased.  The first purchased at a brick and mortar store in Davenport Iowa.  The second from Amazon, so I knew exactly what size to get.  In the vast majority of shoes I wear a 9 1/2 medium width, in some brands that bumps to a 10.  In cases were there is only whole sizes I go 10.  In winter boots with thick socks, 10...you get the point.  For the Wolverines I purchased a 9 1/2 and they fit almost perfectly.  Four stars for the following issues.  Until you get them really broken in you can plainly feel the internal metatarsal plate rub the top of your foot.  The tongue is also not very flexible, probably to keep the met guard in place, but it makes donning and doffing the boot a little more tricky.  The last point leads to this one.  After a few months of wear I pulled my foot out and the internal heel area of the boot and its liner came out.  I tried all the things one does to make the boot last a little longer, glue, duct tape, silicon....etc nothing could be done.<br />So why did I buy again?  Simply for price.<br /> Some people like to buy a much more expensive boot and then take it to a cobbler for a resole and new foot beds.  I have done that before and gave it up.  You spend $200 on a boot, get 6 months to a year before repairs are needed then you pay a cobbler $35 for a resole, $20 for insoles and $5 for laces and you still have the same smelly old boot but with new gear. For less money I can buy 2 new pairs of boots.  I use a system of 4 pairs of boots, I have two metguards when needed and two regular steel toes.  Simply rotate through the week. The boots get time to dry and recover and my boots last YEARS this way.  When one gets too ratty, dispose and replace.  Yes I spend money on boots, but my feet are part of my job and my comfort at work is worth it to me.  4 pairs of boots $500- $600, never having sore feet, legs, hips, back issues or putting on swampy feeling boots in the morning....Priceless.  It works well even with a 2 boot rotation, but I digress.....<br />Brings us back to this boot.  Amazon total with shipping $110.  My first pair lasted well over two years in my rotation.  I rarely work only eight hours and I am on my feet all day in a wide variety of places from construction sites, to factories.  I would project that the boot would last about a year if I wore it daily.  The weak link is the insoles and internal lining.  When I tossed out that 1st pair the sole still had tons of life, the toe had not worn through despite lots of time kneeling and scuffing of the toe.  The leather and stitching was still fully intact and I had replaced the laces only once. I had also replaced the insoles with a decent quality pair after the 1st year in rotation.  So overall it was a great boot.  I actually felt bad throwing it out, but as I said, there was no repairing the inner lining, and God knows I tried to eek out a few more months of service.  So I do recommend it, especially if you need met guards at your workplace.  They are comfortable after break in and the sole wears slowly.  They are on the heavy side, but I'd expect that with the met guard and the thick long lasting sole.  Do not buy for hiking or hunting!!!  They are made in Bangladesh.  I have never dropped heavy stuff on my toes, so I cannot speak to its protective abilities nor do I want to find out.  I assume they will offer the advertised level of protection.	2015-08-11

Technically they are long enough to fit - but they are very narrow.  I've been in them around my office now for about 6 hours, and each step gets more and more painful.  It's mainly due to toe-pinching at the top, so maybe if you have a narrow foot they would work better for you.  I am only hoping they will stretch out enough to be comfy by Fall.	2015-08-11

They were a little bit big but once it gets cooler and she wears thicker socks she will be ok.  And, hopefully they will last her at least 1 year since she grows out of things so quickly.<br />As you can see in the picture, she gives them 2 thumbs up!<br />I also give them 2 thumbs up because they are well made like the rubber boots we used to have.<br />This product was received at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-11

I have a slightly narrow foot so I sometimes have a problem with slides.  These have an adjustable strap and moving it to the last hole resulted in a perfect fit.  I've only tried them on. They feel so good.  I'm 5' tall and wear petite sizes, but even so trousers/jeans are often too long.  So getting a heel high enough that is still comfortable can be a problem especially as I wear a size 6.  The platform on these shoes allow for a comfortable fit while still giving me the leg length and height I need to wear a longer trouser let.  I will say that the stitching slips the &#34;dressy&#34; factor down a notch to &#34;casual&#34;. . . so for really dress-up occasions these shoes don't work--at least for me.  For normal wear--out and about, grocery shopping, doctor's office visits, travel & so on--they are perfect.	2015-08-11

This is an excellent pair and perhaps the best pair of sunglasses for someone with medium to small face.

Love the boots -- nice leather, well constructed, sturdy heel and sole -- but the sizing is WAY off. I tried my actual size first couldn't even put my foot in it -- the 8.5 fit like a six. Tried a 10 and it was also too small. Felt like a 7.5 or an 8 to me. They were also very narrow. I might have been able to wear them at that size had they been a bit wider. Waiting on my next order, 11s, to arrive and hoping for the best. Hope my size equivalency estimations might help some people! Basically, good boot, good price, but go up at least 2 sizes. And they aren't for wide feet.  EDIT: Size 11 finally arrived and fits fine. Very comfortable. Fits like a 9-9.5 would. Updating to 4 stars since the boots themselves are good, but not five because of the sizing issue.	2015-08-11

UPDATE 4 months later below.	This purse is terrific.  There are so many ways to organize.  It's incredibly light.  You can make it very very long if you'd like.  There's only one thing I don't like about it and it's really making me crazy and it's the reason I'm going down to 3 stars:  the zippers.  There are plenty of zippers on this purse and two of them are very difficult to close.  My daughter had to hold the teeth close together while I moved the zipper.  I'm hoping that if we do that enough it will work itself out, but it's really a drag.  Sometimes I get so frustrated that I don't even close the zippers all the way.  But... in every other way this is a great purse so I don't want to return it.  I know... I'm crazy.  UPDATE:  I bought this purse in July and the zippers were very difficult.  It is now November and one of the zippers has actually broken off.  I downgraded my rating to 2 stars for a few reasons:  Yes, it continued to be too difficult zipping and unzipping, so much so that the zipper broke.  2) someone else mentioned this and I didn't think it was a big deal but it actually is a pain... the metal rings on the sides of the purse which hold the strap turn and twist the strap and it looks terrible.  It's impossible to get the strap to stay on the rings the way they should.  I have just bought a Baggalini purse that is similar and we'll see how that goes. So far no problems with zippers and there's no way the strap can move off the rings because it's sewn too close to the rings.  I'm sure that doesn't make sense until you've bought this purse.	2015-08-11

The color and style is very nice, and they are super comfortable with or without socks.  I recommend applying a suede and leather protector, as they are light grey suede that could stain easily.

Adequately equipped. What ruined this boot for me is the weird sizing choice by the manufacturer. I normally wear 9. Size 9 of this boots will give me pain on the side of the front part of my feet. 9.5 will give me enough width, but my feet would move loose front and back wise. So, 9 is too narrow, and 9.5 is too long for me. Even with 9.5, since the design is narrow, the contact pressure of the interior of the shoe would often concentrate on the side front of my feet. Arch support is moderate at best.	2015-08-11

I'm still breaking these beauties in so maybe in time they can be for all day. I had to get large custom stretch straps over the arches, I've never been good at ballet flats and that could be due to my collapsed arches.  Now that they stay on, the hidden high heel is just right for me. I love the classic pointed toe and as to be expected with that, its very snug on the toes. Since they're solid real leather I'm sure they'll break into just the right custom fit over time. With the addition of the strap I give them a 5 star.	2015-08-11

The shoes that I received had a Velcro closure on the outside of the toe straps.  I have read another review where the customer had the same problem.  They looked exactly the same otherwise, but this gave the shoe somewhat of a &#34;granny&#34; look.  I would have tried to make it work, but the Velcro on the ankle and the toe strap was too abrasive and difficult to adjust.  I was disappointed because this shoe was a nice height, and wide enough to walk in and wear all day comfortably. I'm typically a 10/41 (danskos) and could have gone down a half size, but it wasn't an option.  I returned the shoes.  I'll have to try again for a more youthful sandal from clark's.	2015-08-11

They're quite metallic and shiny but those are all bonuses in the eyes of a 2 year old. These are his first light up shoes and he loves to stomp around in them. The light on the top of the right foot stopped flashing recently but the lights on the rest of the shoe are still working. Even after explicit instructions that they're not for playing in the yard, they've made it out there many times and are still mostly functional and not too thrashed. He's about out of the size 7, so I'm pretty sure they will outlive his abuse, which for a pair of toddler shoes I find to be pretty good.	2015-08-11

I use the word &#34;cute&#34; lightly. However, I bought the sandals for some serious hiking in Hawaii and they just don't provide the comfort I am looking for. Let me preface this by explaining that I don't have problematic feet or orthopedic issues, just needed a sandal that I could hike miles in through dry and wet land. Because the straps are so thin, the area around the ankle is unlined like other chunkier Teva sandals, and I found that sans lining, they rubbed a bit where the straps join. This won't do, as I'm hoping to actually avoid blisters. Unfortunately, these beauties are going back and I'm gonna have to settle for their uglier but more practical sister. I'm going with the Teva Terra Fi Lite instead as I've tried them on in stores and can attest to their comfort and support. Hope this review helps as I was confused by the stellar reviews on this sandal but finally figured out that the discomfort around the ankle was due to the lack of lining where the straps join. Too bad.	2015-08-11

I use it as a diaper bag. I have two small children and I needed a bag I could simply throw on my shoulder and be able to retrieve or stow things very easily. This bag holds so much that my old proper diaper bag never could. There are 4 inside pockets and two deep outside pockets perfect for water bottles, everything is cotton lined. I give this 4 stars just because other reviewers are right, the shoulder strap is obviously a different color since it's made from a different material. Also, I feel the bag handles are very flimsy to hold the weight of this bag when it's filled. You would have to store this bag by sitting it on its bottom or by hanging with the provided shoulder strap, you would not be able to store it by hanging it by the bag handles in my opinion. I would not even hang the bag on our stroller by those handles. I plan to buy seperate stroller straps to hang the bag by its shoulder strap hooks.	2015-08-11

I ordered a size up per the suggestions in the reviews before me. The one size up fit perfect. For the quality of the shoe, not that it's poor but the plastic is hard. Not like a true jelly. And as a result, the front straps have already begun to break. I feel like the plastic doesn't allow for flex or bend so when walking those straps begin to crack and then break away. We are down three and the shoes have only been worn for a couple weeks. I will not buy again and I do not recommend.	2015-08-11

Although they're a bit thinner in the material than typical Timberlands (I own about ten other pairs of Timberlands in various types, from boot to bootie, and these are the thinnest in construction), I appreciate that it means I won't have to bring another pair of shoes to work if I'm tromping in from wet or messy weather.  These look great with jeans, casual skirts and dresses, and semi-casual slacks.  I work in a semi-formal-dress environment and these are fine.  Overall, if you're looking for a boot that is both practical and trendy, sleek and comfortable, slim and casual, these will fit the bill.  If you are looking for a boot to wear in a construction zone or while doing something more outdoorsy and rugged, please look elsewhere. As the original description says above--these are &#34;casual&#34; boots, not work boots.	2015-08-11

Ariat is a well known brand for making quality products. I've put these boots through a couple of tests with hiking through wooded foothills, desert and snow. Also used them during paintball and they are great when running. So far they're pretty rugged and have held up to the abuse. They're pretty lightweight, not as light as say the underarmour speed boots, but about as light as altamas.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Kept my feet completely dry in 7 inches of snow<br />Very comfortable for long hikes with a pack or weight<br />Great kryptek highlander color. Its a little less red in appearance in person, more tan and brown with green<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not insulated (not meant to be really). Good socks should take care of you unless you go into the negatives<br />Runs a little narrow, even if you get the wide. If you have remotely wide feet, get the wide.	2015-08-11

I like boots that fit under my pants but not up to my knees so these boots are perfect.  The color is great and goes with many of my slacks, the stitching, zipper, etc is all so well made to last a long time.  I have only used them on and off right now because it has been so hot here so I am looking forward to using them this Fall and Winter.  The heel is just right height for me, I cannot walk well in high heels and I feel like the heel really supports me well and the zipper is easy to use (but not so easy that it is loose).

After an ankle injury, I've been using Hokas, which are cushiony and comfortable but don't have the same support in the upper shoe as Sauconys.  As a long term Saucony wearer, I was hoping that these would provide as much cushioning as Hokas, but they're nowhere near as cushioned.  I'm returning them and switching to Hokas until Saucony comes out with something similar.	2015-08-11

US	24523045	R1BV850IOSXAZT	B00KZW20E2	9501029	Songkran Recycled Round Cross Body Bag	Shoes	4	1	1	N	Y	My Beloved Catfish	I'm going to disclaim right now that I am trying very hard to refrain from using excessive capital letters, &#34;oh my god&#34; 's and exclamation. I seriously love this fish bag, seriously. It highly exceeded my expectations upon arrival and it's so cute. Do you see that fat bodied catfish? I love it, I love that fish. This bag looks so cute and cool and awesome and I'm so sorry I'm being redundant. (!)<br /><br />Okay but in all seriousness this bag is perfect for my needs right now and possibly forever. Its a 9&#34; x 9&#34; circle with an 11.5&#34; zippered opening. both and outer and inner-zipping pocket and 2 inner smart phone-sized slot pockets. The strap is fully adjustable from 53.5&#34; at its longest and 28&#34; at shortest. Also at 3.5&#34; wide it's a lot more spacious than I was expecting and holds all my daily items with a bit of room for any unexpected extras. The inner and outer zip pockets are 5.25&#34; wide by 5.5&#34; deep. The two slot pockets are your average smart phone size.<br /><br />Unfortunately after only a week or so of use the part that rests (and rubs) against my hip has worn off a little ink. I haven't noticed it on any of my clothing but its sad to watch it go from the bag. So keep in mind that any area constantly seeing abrasive wear is probably gonna wear off. My beloved catfish friend and every other part of the bag is perfectly fine.<br /><br />All in all I still really like this bag, I also think it's really cool that they are hand made in the US out of recycled fish feed (rice, etc) bags. I want to buy more but I also never want to stop using this one, ya know? I've added some (be it poor quality cell phone) pictures too. Hope I was helpful!	2015-08-11

Keep in mind, they are not extremely durable if you wear them every day all day like I do.  If you just wear them casually in the summer or to check the mail in the morning, they should last forever.<br /><br />Of all of the Adidas slides I've owned, these are by far the cushiest.  They break in to your feet in about a weeks time and are extremely comfortable.  The velcro is really good and holds on for dear life.  Yes, they can come off in some circumstances, but it is very very rare for me.  While I'm not the biggest fan of the camo look, its okay because my feet are hiding that part.  The only lapse in comfort appears when you first put them on.  If you compress the foam to the point that your feet come in contact with the edges, it can be uncomfortable.  However, once they form fit a bit to your feet, you have that issue very infrequently.  Put them on, wear them around, and enjoy!	2015-08-11

Half marathons are what I enjoy.  My favorite shoes for several years were Mizuno Nirvanas, which are unfortunately discontinued now.  I've tried Mizuno Inspires, Asics Kayanos, and Brooks Adrenalines trying to find that next best shoe.<br /><br />As a runner well into my 40s, I like the idea of something with more cushioning that the Hokas provide.  However, I overpronate and a support shoe works best for me.  Hoka never had that before the Constant.<br /><br />I have a love-hate relationship with these shoes.<br /><br />Things I love:<br />- The ride and cushioning is fantastic.  My knees, hips, and back don't seem to get as beat up on longer runs when I'm wearing these.<br />- The low heel-toe drop makes my muscles work differently.  I like it, but it does take a little getting used to.<br /><br />What I don't love:<br />- Blisters.  I get blisters on the outside of both big toes.  Tried a 10.5 and it was too little.  Went to an 11 and still get them, although not as bad. This has never been a problem in other shoes.  Even my best socks and generous body glide on the offending area is not enough to stave off the blisters. The hot spots show up at 3-4 miles.  Furthest I've dared run with these is 6 miles.<br /><br />I wish they worked for me.  I want them to work.  I love the ride, but just can't deal with the blisters.  My experiment with Hokas has been a failure, but your mileage may vary.	2015-08-11

The back straps can be taken off but due to the aforementioned reasons I rather keep them on. I find the width to be appropriate; it's not wide width yet the edge of my foot does not come out of the shoe (my foot width is C/D in other shoes). I also find that it looks very nice, it's not dressy but can be for everyday wear. I got it in Dark Earth (the brown is a bit darker/deeper than what's pictured), size 7 (true to size). No blisters or redness and I do a lot of walking. Highly recommend.	2015-08-11

I have had two pairs now both with about 200 miles on them before I found them worn out and not useful for running in. They started out great, fast, light, great traction, good cushioning. The problem is that after running in them for around 200 miles they lost all of their cushioning and support, both with the foam in the sole and the insole themselves. They were so packed out and smashed that I had to stop running in them from leg fatigue and pain. I am not a heavy person, 165lbs, so I shouldn't be able to destroy a shoe that fast. I called to have them considered a warranty issue since Altra says you should get 300-500 miles out of them. I was told that I first had to send them back to the place I purchased them. Shouldn't it be the manufacturers responsibility to fix a problem with their product, not the store selling them? I purchased them from a brick and mortar store 500 miles from where I live and it isn't that stores responsibility to fix Altra's problems. Second, they said if it was after 30 days (Now, I actually put 200 miles on a pair of shoes in 30 days, but I would guess most people don't.) Altra could only offer you 25% off of a new pair purchased directly from them. Anybody paying full retail price from the manufacturer is overpaying because with the internet you should be able to find a reduced price somewhere, so offering me a coupon for 25% off only good at their website doesn't save me money, and on top of that doesn't get me a warranty. I was told to purchase them from a store that offered returns on items after Altra's 30 day policy expired. I would love to keep running in them, but there is no way I can afford $110 or even $82.50 for as many pairs of shoes I need for my training.	2015-08-11

I've got about 250 miles on the pair now, so I feel I can give an experienced review overall.  These are dedicated running shoes for me, no other usage aside from warm up walks and street running - asphalt, concrete, very rarely grass when I have to skirt around puddles or slippery pavement.  I only ran in the rain a couple of times.<br /><br />First, quickly, these are very comfortable shoes, lightweight, and stylish.  I trained up to a 5k (3.1 miles) without any issues aside from 1 little section of mesh on the left shoe spontaneously disappearing/breaking.  Not sure how that happened, but it did.  It has not gotten worse over 100 miles or so, which speaks highly of their mesh quality I suppose.  Could have snagged something I suppose.<br /><br />When I got past 3.1 miles consistently, that's when I started to get a case of plantar fasciitis in my right foot, and the right side of my foot (outer edge) started to bug me.  Not sure if I'm just dealing with a shoe that is 1/2 size too small or something (my foot feels great in it, before running, during and after).  But, it's interesting to note that as my distance increased (very gradually) and these shoes are aging, something has changed.<br /><br />I also noticed a tear above the left big toe, in the fabric layer under the mesh.  It's about 1/2 inch now, but I expect that will grow.  And gradually my toe will probably poke through the mesh - before that happens, I intend to retire this pair for a new pair shortly and use these for walking.<br /><br />So, I expect to get about 250-300 miles out of this pair of shoes.  I've read you can usually get around 400 miles out of a shoe, but that's probably a general guideline and lots of factor come into play - your personal stride/gait/wear patterns, surfaces you run on, etc.<br /><br />Aside from the unexpected wear above the toe, the random mesh fraying, and plantar fasciitis in my right foot (which honestly I can't attribute to the shoe necessarily, but it's worth noting), I do enjoy how these shoes feel on my feet and while running.  I may get another pair (perhaps a little bigger) or I might try another brand...haven't decided.	2015-08-11

Waterproof, sturdy, attractive low-rise boots for my son's everyday shoes. He's been wearing these for a week and they still look like new, while the sneakers he had before were destroyed within a day on the playground (they weren't cheap sneakers, either!). I'm getting them in the next size up as well at this price!  For his slightly wide feet, they fit just fine and they are Regular width. He's 8 and wears a size 4. He's a shoe murderer to boot, but I think I have him beat with these!	2015-08-11

I chose Kipling because I also had one in high school which lasted me well after I graduated.<br /><br />The backpack is very durable and made with high quality material. It's very comfortable to wear or even carry. One if the best features is that it doesn't have a flap over the zipper. The one flaw of this backpack, and the reason why I can't give it the 5th star is that it is not as large as I expected. It still fits my son's books and notebooks, but his binder does not fit.

When I first ordered these shoes, I got a size 7- my regular shoe size. However, the shoes were too big. My heels slipped out even with socks and insoles. I exchanged them for a 6.5, which fits much better. These shoes will now take some breaking-in before I will be able to wear them all day. They rub the backs of my heels a bit and require bandaids to prevent blisters. I hope they break in quickly! The color is perfect- not too shiny and will match everything. I very much like how they look!	2015-08-11

There are a lot of comments on the tan version of these boots, both good and bad. Overall I am pleased with my boots. They are made of high-quality leather, as opposed to the C4T predecessors.  It does add a bit of weight, but the durability is worth it (not to mention they are actually AR670-1 compliant).  They have great insoles and are very comfortable right away. That being said, there is one negative comment that comes up over and over again: the boots pinch on the top of the foot.  When I first put them on, one pinched, one didn't. Upon a simple examination, I discovered that the pinch is because the seam was folded over where the tongue meets the rest of the boot on the top of the feet. A little bit of care when putting the boots on, and loosening them a lot solves this problem. Nevertheless, I shouldn't have to loosen my laces all the way each time I put the boots on. This is very obviously a flaw that could be easily fixed by Rocky in the future, and I hope they do so. If not for that, these boots would get 5 stars.	2015-08-11

First, let me say, I was thrilled when I opened the package.  The clutch is absolutely beautiful.  I brought it for an evening wedding I was attending and it was lovely with my dress.  I did discovered a few issues with it the more I used it.  First, the chain strap tends to get caught on things--my hair, my lace dress--so I  removed it.  Secondly, the front of the clutch, while beautiful, tends to catch on things as well so I had to be careful how I held the clutch or it would snag on my dress.  Finally, there is a small space that things can fall out.  My lipstick and phone stayed inside fine but I did lose my lip liner when it fell out.	2015-08-11

I am a shoe girl, and I really do love most all shoes, so I was very excited to be given a chance to try out a pair of Riverberry's Gaby Fashion Stiletto Heels.  The heels are not super high and are a comfortable height.  I purchased the Gold Snake version because I had a wedding to attend this past weekend and they were just perfect!  The shoes did really well all evening and were fairly comfortable for me.  I did take a pair of sandals to wear while dancing because I am clumsy and heels and me dancing don't mix.  These are a super classic looking heel and I would love to pick up a few more pairs.  They seem to be really well made as well.  They fit me very true to size, and I wear a size 9.  I would highly recommend the Riverberry Gaby Fashion Stiletto heels for everyone! I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review. All opinions are my very own.	2015-08-11

My feet are size 5.5, right foot slightly wider than left. The shoes fit, but the strappiness and heel height is definitely better on a narrower foot. Arch support was ok, I could wear this a couple of hours but it's not what you would call a comfort shoe. The middle strap, as other reviews mentioned, is a little loose and floppy. Overall, the price was right considering the drawbacks. I'll still wear these shoes to future events. They're ok, not perfect.	2015-08-11

He said that it is the best pair of winter boots he has ever owned.<br /><br />Now getting a compliment out of my husband, with that high of a rating, is a flat out miracle.  He never likes anything and always has a complaint, but with these boots, no complaints of any kind.<br /><br />He did say that if you are in weather, above 50*, that you may have to unzip them, to let your feet breathe and cool down.  They are exceptionally made and very good looking boots, on.  Not too thick, that his jeans won't go over the top of them, to wear on the outside of his boots.  Even better when the jeans are tucked in and no issues with the upper being tight, if the jeans are tucked in.<br /><br />If you work outdoors, in the frigid temps, I recommend getting these.  Your toes and feet will feel like they are on the beach, when it's -11* outside.	2015-08-11

Here's the deal.  I wear my boots for 12-14 hours a day, every day.  I walk an average of 6-8 miles per day for work, on surfaces ranging from concrete and asphalt to snow, through streams, and over pipeline right-of-way.  I honestly wear my boots every single day, walking 7 miles per day, (on average according to the pedometer on my phone,) and I usually get about 2 years out of a pair of Super Loggers.<br />I've owned lots of Red Wings, I've owned Rockys and Carolinas, and I guarantee you that Chippewa Super Loggers are the best boots money can buy.  I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for a pair of Red Wings, and I'll never own another pair of Rockys.  I'm 6'4&#34; and 275 lbs, and if a guy my size can get 4500-5000 miles of walking out of a pair of boots, well that's pretty impressive.<br />They are as waterproof as a pair of muck boots (albeit not as tall,) and they're made in the USA.  Now, if you want a pair of work boots because you want to look tough in front of your buddies, then go buy a 50 dollar pair at Wal-Mart;  but if you're one of those guys, (like I used to be,) who never found a boot that was tough enough, then look no further.  Think about how much money your old lady spends on her shoes.  Do you think she ever walked 5000 miles in a pair of them?  I don't think so.  If you wear your boots all day every day, then these are a bargain at twice the price.  Stop reading this and buy these boots!	2015-08-11

New Balance M670 are very comfortable shoes. Those that bought these shoes at regular size made a huge mistake. I'm regularly a twelve in other shoes. Yet I know with this amazing brand you must go up one size. These shoes are very well cushioned. I work in a warehouse, so I'm on concrete all day long. These shoes make it so I have much less foot and ankle pain. The absorb heel support technology is great for those that need extra support for their feet. Throw in some aftermarket insoles, and you have got yourself a wonderful shoe.<br /><br />I own 3 other pairs of New Balance, and these are the best I have bought yet. I love all of my New Balance. Yet I would say as far as looks, and support combined these bad boys take the cake.<br /><br />New Balance gets my money also because most of their shoes are assembled in the USA. I have these M670s in the Blue and green. What a well designed shoe. Not to mention I payed 24 bucs total on amazon prime. These shoes are 75 bucs at every store, and every other online site.	2015-08-11

A little stiff around the ankle when I am walking but I don't feel it at all when I run.  Changed from a 5 star and here are my reasons:   Ok so here it is a little over a week later and I am going to be buying new shoes. For a short run of 3 miles or so they were fine but anything over that and they hurt my legs, feet, knees and I started having hip and quad pain that I have never had before. I put several miles in these shoes and they are still stif as a board! I will be buying On's again but am going back to the Cloudsurfer. Those have been the only shoe I have ever run pain free in and after spending well over $150 on these shoes I wish I had stuck with the Cloudsurfers.	2015-08-11

This is my second pair of beautiful Bonnie boots (thanks to a 3 mo.old German Shepard whose chewing habit is at least eqdual to my O.G. habit) and my 8th pair of Old Gringos. The leather is super supple but sturdy (my puppy can vouge for this) they are a bit snug when you first get them but stretch.and form to your foot from.the first time you wear them. These were are my all time favorite boots (coming from someone who owns no less than 40 pairs) they are comfortable right out of the box although I always add a padded insert which guarantees all day and night comfort and they go with everything!  My favorite is with a  little western fees as but I have yet to wear them with anything and not get stopped/complimented multiple times. I oil all of my boots that are not suede to protect them from weather and would recommend anyone else to for extended life. The one negative with O.G. is the soles wear quickly, for such an expensive boot I would expect more (I don't have this problem with my Lucchese or Frye boots) but O.G. is so far ahead of the game in style  they are and continue to be my favorites even with what I see as flaws. They are expensive, but your worth it! You will love these boots. I would buy your regular size, I always have and they always fit great. I do add an insert but the leather will.warm and stretch to your foot.	2015-08-11

They look good for a few days, but it doesn't take long for a less-than-aesthetically-pleasing crease situates itself on the top of the shoe.

They typically take a week or so to break in, but after that these boots feel just great! These Crosstrails have a great sole that flexes just where it should. I feel more balanced on ladders and concrete. I work in a factory so I'm forever climbing on and over machinery. Never once have I stumbled in these boots. I say this because my previous pair of cheap boots just felt odd with how I walk and move around. These Caterpillar's are dammed near perfect!<br /><br />My only beef is that I always have to replace the insoles. This is not just Caterpillar, but ALL boots I've purchased. I don't get why after spending so much money I always have to spend just a bit more for insoles. But comfort is key after working 40 plus hours on my feet all week. These insoles are flabby material when you pull them out. If you have high arches, get an insole to support them.<br /><br />Another note. The bottom of the box says 'Wolverine' on the bottom. Sounds to me like Caterpillar and Wolverine are sharing footwear designs.	2015-08-11

With Amazon prime I got the free two day free shipping, and they arrived right on time. I put them on and went to work. They fit perfect, and are very comfortable. I worked the whole shift like I was walking on clouds. They are well build with comfy in souls and thick outer souls, and look great. It's been a little over a week, and no sore feet. I think I'm good to go for at least a year or longer. Time will only tell how long they will last. I am thinking about ordering another pair, so when these ware out I will have them already on hand to go again. Thank you Amazon !!!!!.	2015-08-11

They never did! I assume this is because they are a Clark's Classic. I finally ordered these boots at Amazon's fantastic price and LOVE them. I have a wide foot and long toes and had to exchange my 7.5 for an 8 as I could feel my toes right against the front of the shoe. The size 8 is perfect!!! The crepe sole provides a lot of cushion where arch support is lacking, but then I have strong feet and don't mind less support. Definitely condition the leather.	2015-08-11

I rarely wear flats, and got those for casual Fridays to wear with skinny jeans, looks good. It is a great alternative to sandals. I find the shoe to fit well. My feet are narrow but usually regular 7 size fits me, and this fits perfect. I like the shoes that have elastic around so that they do not get out of my feet. I usually get elastic styles in 7.5 but this one was perfect in size 7.<br /><br />I only wear them at work, so cannot tell how it will be walking outdoors, but for office they are great. Purple color is nice, deep purple, not flashy and goes very well with jeans.	2015-08-11

Amazon had a great deal on them while the other site was full price. The shoes arrived in the original box from Kate Spade with a dust bag. They fit true-to-size for me (6B) but they're not the most comfortable shoe. I wore then as a guest for a wedding and kept them on all night but toward the end of the reception, I was walking much slower. The sole under the toes is not padded very well but that's the case for my other Kate Spade shoes.<br /><br />Do note that the bow in the front is not seamed the whole way around - it's an unfinished edge toward the outside of the shoe.	2015-08-11

In particular, I selected this model because I liked the idea of the buckle for quickly getting in/out of them. Well, that didn't work.  The buckle is on the *outside*, bottom of the strap.  Can you reach that spot easily?  Can you reach it WITH TWO HANDS?  Because otherwise, you CANNOT buckle these shoes.  That makes the &#34;feature&#34; absolutely USELESS!  That alone should have me returning them...since I paid extra to have it.  But, additionally, I found the straps to be thin and insufficiently padded where there isn't additional padding on them.  All in all, these are NOT worth the money!	2015-08-11

Purchase, be prepared for a sandal on a sneaker. Also, it's not unusual to not want to take them off. Or, try to match every outfit to your &#34;Merrell&#34;. So, buy more than one ... quickly!! Though i lived abroad in the U.S.A. for two decades. I got my 1st. Shoe here in Trinidad. Wore Burkinstocks forever. These are slicker, prettier and just as comfortable. This is only my 3rd. Merrell, but definitely not my last. I bought a size 11. My feet are 4&#34; wide at the base of my toes. And, 10 1/2&#34; in length to the tip of my middle toes. I live in Trinidad and Tobago and can't easily return if there's a problem. So, when i get a Brand of shoe that lives up to the price( that i've never paid in full  :) )  i'm motivated to write a review. Even when it takes me .. forever to get the picture right. ps. This shoe arrived at my friend's home the day he left for Trinidad. Got it so quickly!!  Wore it the same day!  Tried to upload pictures from my Kindle...	2015-08-11

These boots, the SIYA Little Boys Blue & Black Fire Truck Fireman Rain Boots w/ Lining, are absolutely adorable!  I purchased them for my 8 year old son (soon to be 9) because he loves firetrucks (what boy doesn't).  When they came in, exactly as scheduled, I let him know the box was for him.  He absolutely LOVES them!  He wanted to wear them all day!  Then today (the day I write this post) he wanted to wear them to the first day of school (but it isn't raining so I didn't let him).  He said they are so comfortable he doesn't mind wearing them at all!  The box they were shipped in was the exact size needed, not too big and not too small and was delivered right on time, which was on a Sunday!  They were not in any separate packaging, only the Amazon box.<br /><br />*This item was purchased at little to no cost for my honest review.	2015-08-11

Quality, dense rubber flip flop that fits snug but comfortably. Not really footwear that is intended for walking any significant distance, but works great at the pool, beach, and shower at the gym. Grip and traction are great, even when wet. Definitely a step up (no pun intended) from a cheap pair of flip flops. Could not give it 5 stars because of the strong smell of rubber that has still not dissipated, even though I have used them in a chlorinated pool several times and rinsed them thoroughly. I have to put this pair on top of my gym bag because the smell would permeate my clothes inside the bag.	2015-08-11

Mizuno is not a household name for us.... we are big on Adidas, Nike, UnderArnour, etc. so when these came up on Vine I was excited to have my family try something new and different.<br /><br />Upon arrival I was immediately impressed with the build quality of these shoes; excellent design and workmanship and the detailing of the differing materials combine for a great look.<br /><br />I originally ordered for my older daughter however upon trying on discovered that these were easily a full size too small... uh-oh...  Plan B: called in my younger daughter (9) and let her try them on and they fit well!  A little on the big side for her bit for a running shoe you want the extra area for foot expansion (I am no guru here but I was told by a runner at a running store in my area that shoes used for running need to be at least 1 size larger to accommodate for foot expansion upon landing) so these were right there.<br /><br />Immediately she commented on the lightness of the shoes as well as the bounciness of the sole. Quite a bit of cushioning in the heel and forefoot areas. There is also a medium-wide toe box allowing her little toes to remain wiggly and unbound.<br /><br />To the track.. or, rather, sidewalk. First walk and run went fine. Plenty of support and stability for the flats, hills, and corners. All OK on these fronts.<br /><br />Once we had put these through the paces I had my daughter give these shoes the ultimate test: PRANCERCISE. Yes, I had my daughter prancercise (Google it) down the street.... she had fun, I smiled, and the shoes held up to that physical abuse!<br /><br />All in I would definitely get these again. Great styling, design, and construction. There is some issue with sizing so buyer beware in this and ensure that if you buy here you have free returns... just in case. Prancercise on!!	2015-08-11

I wear a 6 1/2 shoe, and usually a 7 in a pull on boot due to my high instep.  These were a gift, and the person who bought them insisted that I would need to go down to a 6. They arrived and I nearly fainted . It truly was a struggle to even get them on, but I did.  The second time I wore them, I was able to wear them for 5 or 6 hours . I NEVER struggled with them again. They truly do &#34;give&#34; and mold to your feet, and when they do, you'll never go back to another boot. They are the most comfortable, warmest boots ever. I love them!	2015-08-11

I'm a stagehand for a local burlesque troupe and bought them for that purpose but I love them so much I wear them on a pretty regular basis. They're extremely comfortable and hold up well to water and mud. The laces allow them to be adjusted to fit more narrow feet and legs which is cool because I'm a size 11 which usually translates to a huge calf in a boot. I was thrilled to find them and definitely recommend them!!! -On a side note, I wore them to a renn faire dressed as a pirate and got asked all day long where I found these and what shop sold them. Considering custom boots at most faires run for hundreds of dollars, these are pretty much a steal if you're looking for a costume. :)	2015-08-11

Ai yi yi. The leather has already separated from the cork, and the sole has become unglued after only a month of occasional wear. The footbed does cut in somewhat, and the strap does rub. But there's no trade-off for a shoe you like that actually fits your foot, and here I am buying pair #2 and sending pair #1 off to the shoemaker to be fixed. What can ya do?	2015-08-11

The picture is what sold me and so did some of the reviews.  However I am very disappointed.  Bought this purse for my mom who is 83.<br />She likes fashionable, and I thought this would be perfect.  The purse color is exactly what is pictured, the handles are made just fine, but you see that gold trim on the purse, well its covered in plastic to protect it.  However when you remove the plastic it leaves a horrible residue all over the gold.  I tried a little warm water on a sponge, no luck.  I tried a little comet on a tooth brush, and no luck.  I tried a little fingernail polish remover on a q-tip and no luck and the gold kind of bubbled.  This wasn't an inexpensive purse but not real expensive either.  The embossed alligator print actually looks rather cheap, and the lining is okay.  I get frustrated when I buy things like this.  Yes I should return it but I gave it to my mom anyway.  I told her the whole story, and said if you hate it just put it in the needy box to donate.	2015-08-11

Crocs are gross and the worst shoes in fashion history! These have an obnoxious yellow band and while wearing them i look like a grown man in children's shoes. With that said, i love wearing crocs around the house as slippers, they are comfortable you can get them wet, dirt and odor can be easily washed away. I also wear garden and no fears about dirt or water. The star wars design is fun although a little obnoxious but i love the gaudy things.<br /><br />Bottom line if you love star wars, enjoy the comfort of crocs in your own home i high recommend them. if you are planning to wear them in public, shame on you!	2015-08-11

After reading other reviews i decided to order a half size down (I normally wear a 6.5 and ordered a 6). If I bought these again, which I wouldn't do, I would have ordered a size and a half smaller. Also, these shoes are NOT comfortable. I have some experience with heels, admittedly heels shorter than these, and so after reading some reviews saying they were comfortable I decided to buy them. It would be impossible for me to do anything more than go out to dinner and immediately come back if I was wearing these shoes out. Unfortunately, I was unable to return these shoes because I only tried to wear them out about two months after I bought them and at that point it was too late to return them. So, the shoes are cute and look as they do in the picture, but I hate them. Now these devil shoes sit in my closet and mock me for by bad purchase.	2015-08-11

These are great shoes by just looking at them, they have the wonderful hard rubber throughout the whole sole that means you don't lose the tread on them within the first 3 months. But this pair were just a little too snug on each side of my upper foot in the toe area, though to be fair, my feet are on the wider side. I can wear normal sizes in many styles but some are just too narrow. The length seemed like it could be fine but it was hard to tell with the tightness on the sides.<br /><br />I can't go up half a size due to having a size 11 women's foot, but I just ordered a 11W to see if the wide version might fit better and make them wearable.<br /><br />I love Skechers as a brand and while I love the D'Lites line, I hate the foam like inner sole that wears out too quickly. The Sports line has the better more durable sole that I need as someone who is walking around all day long, everyday (as a nanny) and so I really hope that the wides will fit great. I have 4 other styles and another (as well as the Sports Energy) on the way. I have been wearing nothing but Skechers since 2003 and I absolutely love them.	2015-08-11

Could be better for $30+	I would give these glasses 3 1/2 stars if possible.  They are well made and are as described.  They have a good polarized lens and come with the round bamboo protective case [the case isn't very practical and a bit bulky for travel but is sturdy enough to protect the classes.  The glasses come in a cloth pouch with a cleaning cloth.  The lenses have graduated tint.  The flexible hinges for the arms work well.  They are good quality but much lighter weight than I thought they would be which I see as a positive.  The only thing I am not thrilled with is the darkness of the stain which hides the grain and tone of the wood [I know it's bamboo and bamboo is a grass but you know what I mean] and the grain could be cut differently giving the glasses more of a wood &#34;look&#34; that I saw on other glasses.  I think that these are overpriced by about $10 considering others that are available in that dollar range.	2015-08-11

I rec a ton of compliments and wore them a lot as they go with almost everything. However after 4-5 months they started to fall apart in the sole. I found a cobbler to fix but it is actually less expensive to just purchase a new pair. In all I loved these boots. However, I wish the company would fix their sole problem this is my third pair of boots from this company (different styles) and all the soles have either cracked producing large holes in the bottom of my shoes or broken away at the heel.	2015-08-11

If you're looking for a well made sophisticated shoe then I highly recommend these classic Marc Jacobs pumps!	2015-08-11

Aviator style sunglasses are my absolute favorite and when I saw that these came with my favorite color &#34;Pink!&#34; lenses I was so happy!<br /><br />They have very strong reinforced hinges that allow the ear pieces to bend back and forth. This is a great feature for me because my daughter will often grab my sunglasses off of my face and this ends up with lots of broken glasses. These are very comfortable and offer the perfect amount of eye protection. I wasn't squinting or feeling like I was stuck in a dark cave.<br /><br />I've been wearing the glasses for nearly a week and so far no scratches and I'm still absolutely in love with them. They even came with a protective bag and microfiber cleaning cloth.<br /><br />I was given a reduced cost for trying out these sunglasses and reviewing them. I would have paid full price. They are fabulous and I will be ordering another pair for my Husband!	2015-08-11

I normally wear a size 12 shoe, If I have anything other than a bare foot in these size 13-14 size they are tight. Seeing I purchased another pair of Isotoner in size 13-14 size this is unacceptable because they clearly don't care of consistancy in sizing. Additionally I purchased two other pairs of Isotoner slippers from amazon that didn't have free returns a while back. They were even smaller. I'm only buying free return slippers and items from amazon now due to this. They will be getting these back.<br /><br />If you can buy one / find one in your size, and they fit properly, they would be decent since they are not bad looking and seem somewhat durable. Since this was not the case for me 2 stars is all I can give.	2015-08-11

Good looking leather inside and outside.  Excellent looking and have the lug sole and heel for great traction.  This model has a pebble grain leather with just a little shine so they look good casual or dressy.  With the rugged bottoms I prefer them casual (with jeans) but they have an elegant look and smooth lines with no harness or buckles added.  The side zip is the best design for easy on and off while still giving you a tighter fit than pull on boots (there is little or no heel slip like in a traditional cowboy boot).  Frye Boots are the best in cowboy or biker style boots without a doubt.	2015-08-11

Very durable so it will last me many summers without falling apart. Most thongs slide a little to the side so my heel isn't wearing where it's intended in other thongs however in this shoe my feet are wearing right where they're supposed to. If they get wet they dry right away and I don't slip in them on wet sidewalks. They are cushiony which makes my feet happy and the strap is soft so there are never any irritations. They really are the best casual shoe I've ever worn. I hope they make them forever.	2015-08-11

I have pretty average sized feed and don't normally buy narrow or wide shoes. With no strap around my ankle to help keep them on, I knew the sloppy over-sizing wouldn't work well for me. The strap closest to the leg does adjust with velcro but I couldn't tighten it enough to make a difference as it was the toe strap that seemed wide and that one didn't adjust. They were super cute and wish that they had fit better so I could have kept them.	2015-08-11

I'm told they look like &#34;old man's shoes&#34; but I don't think so. To be honest I don't even know what that means. I like the fact they are mono-black. I really needed a new pair of shoes after my foot surgery. I shattered my left heel and really needed shoes that had more padding in the heel. These shoes definitely do! The option to order these in a wide size was also a factor in my purchase as well. I am very happy with these shoes and I can relax somewhat when walking because I'm confident I have the cushioning I need! If you've had any type of foot surgery I highly recommend them. I've seen some reviews that state the sizing was off but mine fit perfectly ordering the size I usually order.	2015-08-11

I waited a while to write my review for these sandals because I wasn't sure about them at first. The fit seemed odd across the top of my foot, but they were reasonably comfortable on. Since then, I have come to like them more with wear. They seemed to have adapted a bit to my foot shape, and the weird curve the straps had at the top of my foot no longer is there. The foot base seems a little long at the top of the foot though. I notice it more on one foot than the other. I can push my foot forward in the sandal, but it does seem to work its way back again over time. Overall, I really like the sandals. The color, the general style, and the comfort level are all very high. I am pleased with my purchase.	2015-08-11

I have numerous Baggalini products and love them all! The designers for Baggalini actually know what women like in their bags/ purses.  If I see the name Baggalini I generally take a deeper look at the product. I've actually purchased this bag in a large variety of colors.  For ages, I looked for a bag that would be lightweigt (as I have a poor back)  and durable.  This bag is it. The purchaser would have the option of using a wallet, as there is an area to hold credit cards on the inside.  Also, it has pockets for pens, a phone, and an inside zippered area for security. It comes with a detachable zippered bag, as well. The zippered bag can be removed and the hook can be used for keys.  The larger outside pocket I use for a variety of items, such as a comb, mirror, keys, etc.  It's actually a spacious area that can hold quite a number of items without bulking the backpack.  The two smaller pockets on the outside are perfect for smaller items.  Probably one of the greatest ideas that needs to be imperative in designing bags is making the lining of the bags a light color, versus a dark black or brown. As we age, those dark inside colors make it nearly impossible to locate anything in the bag.  Baggalini has resolved this issue. All the bags I purchased have a lighter inside lining... love it.  I'm thinking there would be no reason why this bag couldn't be washed, as well. However, I haven't had the need wash it yet.  It is just the perfect all around bag!	2015-08-11

Both of us have &#34;wide&#34; feet, but that is only partly true.  Our feet are a little wide, but our feet never get narrower at the toe. I've worn a keen half-hiking boot for 2 years now and found their shoe design to be perfect for my feet.  My dad has typically had to buy shoes with EEE (triple width) and a little too long to give his toes room to be &#34;wide&#34; (I consider it normal!).  With these, he ordered the size he should wear (9.5) and the shoes fit perfectly.  It's a dream to have shoes designed that do not cramp your toes or come to a ridiculously narrow point.<br /><br />He's been wearing these to work outside (farm work, moving furniture, ... active outdoor work) and absolutely loves them.	2015-08-11

I LOVE ankle boots, and obviously I love leopard print.  Also, love a bargain, and I nabbed a size 7 at a great price.  What's not to adore about these?<br />Here's my thoughts on the Pamla Bootlie.<br />These seem to run a little narrow.  Since the boots are made of leather (at least partially) I expect them to be able to stretch and break in.<br />The heel is high, yes.  If you're not used to wearing 3&#34; or 4&#34; heels, this may not be the shoe for you.  The fact that this is a bootie does make it easier to walk in them, though - if you're on the fence.<br />The ankle strap is kind of weird.  An odd design choice, but I like it.  It adds that &#34;something extra&#34; to what would otherwise be a plain pair of boots.  It would have been awesome if the strap was removable but unfortunately it's attached at the back.  The strap does feel odd, and you'll want to flex your foot while doing it up, otherwise you may find it digging in as you sit or drive.  You do get used to it though!<br />My only issues are the narrow width, and the print.  Everyone's idea of the perfect leopard print is different (Ivanka Trump's shoes have the BEST, IMO) but the print on these seems a little...messy?  However, I am quite happy with my new leopard print ankle boots!  I've gotten several compliments already.	2015-08-11

Fit really snug but that's kinda to be expected of dr. Martens. This is my second pair and I know they are hard to break in at first, especially since I have wide feet.

I LOVE last year's Iris in Otter brown. I'm returning Iris II. It has a nicer arch support, but it's too wide for me and the straps are placed differently so the last one rubs right on my instep. The Iris had a matching brown sole and the bottom came up to the protect the heel - it was a slimmer profile which I prefer and the monochrome made it a nicer looking sandal in my opinion. Iris II is very casual looking but Iris could be dressed up. I have narrow feet and I have several pairs of Ahnus. I hope this isn't a trend toward making them wider.	2015-08-11

Very well made and stylish glasses.  Lens and frame are bamboo with an aluminum insert for strength that helps keep the frame thinner and sleeker looking.  The Inside has a beautiful rich teak colored wood tone.  The arms have spring hinges that work well and have a flexible rubber portion for the ears.  The front of the frame and the arms are stained black but the grain still is visible if you look closely.  The side view has a  very cool look with the inside wood tone, bright white/silver of the aluminum and the dark front face.<br />The lenses are polarized as described.  I have a fairly large head and these fit me well with the flexible frame but they also fit my petit wife well and looked good on her too.  Lenses are slightly larger than the lenses for the Ray-Ban Wayfarer's that I replaced.  I wasn't sure about the larger size at first but have adjusted.  These are still unique and you don't see many out there which I like.<br /><br />These are very well built for the money.  I would love to have a pair where the entire frame, except for the ear portion, was the same look and tone of the back side of the frame.  Those would be very cool glasses and I would definitely buy a pair if they were in the same price range or even slightly higher.	2015-08-11

These sunglasses are so cute and really contour my face quite well. Good quality. The one thing I love the most about these glasses is that they do not &#34;magnify&#34; when looking through the lenses like cheap sunglasses do. It is hard for me to find sunglasses that do not give me migraines because of this issue. These sunglasses have been amazing so far. Not a single headache. They are very clear and well made. They are definitely my new favorite and have replaced my oakley shades as my go to glasses.

I do not have any pricey handbags and decided to treat myself. I love Rebecca Minkoff style so I decided to give this one a try. It was packaged and wrapped up very nicely also with its own little carrying bag to protect it during shipping. I know some people were saying this bag didn't have a leather smell to it which they were disappointed about thinking it wasn't authentic. Well mine did smell a lot like leather and is 100% a Minkoff handbag. The only reason I gave this item 4 starts instead of 5 was because one of the bottom straps that has the buckles was bent the other way making some crinkly lines and for the price I paid this bag should have came without that. That being said I would order this item again from the same seller just wish the strap wasn't bent.	2015-08-11

I'll buy another pair.	I am so glad I found these. A horsewoman was wearing a pair to a meeting and I thought they looked sharp. She told me how comfortable they are and that she wears them 3 seasons up here in Vermont. I checked the source she uses and then, because I have Prime, I checked here and found them for $25 less and an even snappier design. Two days after receiving them, I wore them all day traveling through 3 airports and then in very hot destination. They are comfortable, relatively light, substantial support through sole and heel. And comfortable (did I mention that before?). I have received so many compliments on them! How did I not know about these Ariat boots before?	2015-08-11

They were a little on the big side, but I'm ok with that. It gives my daughter a little grow room. Now if only my kid wasn't absolutely terrified of rolling around with the wheels in.<br /><br />The wheels are easy to put in and take out- I don't even need the tool, which is good as I put it in the key rack day one of getting the shoes and it had disappeared the same day before I ever got to use it. The husband denies doing anything with it but since he's the only one who could reach it and he liked to 'confiscate' tools and put them in his garage even if the tools are not his and he doesn't even know what it's for, I highly suspect it will be found in all his junk. No hurry to get it yet as I don't even need the tool- yet the wheels stay snugly in their slot. This was important to me as my daughter's school doesn't allow the wheels so once my daughter gets over her nervousness we'll use them on the wall to school and I'll pop the wheels out at the gate.	2015-08-11

We have tried some other flip flops before and they did not like them. Then they reluctantly tried these on. They have been wearing them all summer!<br />The straps are a soft double layer nylon that contacts the foot. The nylon in between the toes is very soft, supple and non-chaffing. The sole is a firm foam with a non-marking, non-slip base. These can get wet and do dry quickly, the straps stay damp for an hour or so. My boys wear them everywhere and they are holding up well.

I have run about 180 miles in my pair in about 3 weeks and have a few detractors to list. First, the sole is coming unglued from the foam. Second, the lugs seem to not be very sturdy as I am missing parts of a few and most show more wear than I feel like they should at less than 200 miles. Third, the mountain laminated picture on the outside of the shoe is peeling off. Fourth, this shoe is sized larger than previous models, so you would need to size a half size down. Fifth, because it is wide, turning sharp corners at speed causes my foot to tip off of the edge of the shoe because there isn't much lateral stiffness in the upper.<br /><br />Now some good: Much lighter and faster feeling then the previous models. Cushioning is very good and smooths out rocky trails very well. Traction is great (until the lugs come off). Overall the fit is nice and having a soft upper really lets my foot expand as needed. No blisters or hot spots with these shoes.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Again, durability and sizing seem to elude Altra. If it wasn't for the wide toe box and solid trail features, I would look at different brands. Their customer service is poor, and there isn't any help with the &#34;warranty&#34; unless you purchase shoes from them directly, which in most cases cost you an extra 20% over what you would pay elsewhere. It would be nice to see them stand up for their product and make it right by an unsatisfied customer.	2015-08-11

I am obsessed with my birks, OK I am going to be honest I am a huge shoe snob, even my flip flops are designer. I thought these were so horrific. I even used to make fun of my friends for wearing them.<br />  After being told to get orthopedic shoes due to falling arches and failing knees (as a high schooler) I broke down and got the closest thing to fashionable briks I could and well I'm hooked. I have begun to wear them even around the house which for me used to be barefoot territory.  I am even wearing them now as I type this review (in bed). If you have suffered through this review get them just know that if you are a woman with average width feet get the narrow size as that is what the US standard is (this is mentioned on the birk website as well) enjoy your new best friends!	2015-08-11

They fit comfortably and look fantastic on him. They block all sun light and everything was clear as he drove. They are not your usual glasses that make everything dark.

The colors are actually that pretty in person too - I got the brown and olive, and I'm very happy I did. Lovely leather.<br />Anyway, I'm pleased with them. They certainly don't look like riding boots, but I think they are stylish enough to wear with a cute outfit in a place that gets real snow. And the soles of the shoe are really, really thick. Like if you've never had serious snowboots before you might think they are a little clunky, but it didn't bother me and I was happier to make sure my feets were gonna be dry. I think these are going to last a while.<br />Oh, and I need arch supports, so I stuck my inserts in there. The bottom is a little wide and flat on my narrow feet, but with the arches they were perfect.	2015-08-11

I purchased these sneakers because I had been having foot and ankle pain as a result of supination. I'm a little late to the party and recently learned that all running sneakers are not created equal. Years ago when I was in high school, I loved to run. Since I've sustained multiple foot and ankle injuries, I had not been able to run in years without pain. After doing a bit of research, I learned that it is likely that all of my twisted ankles and injuries were a result of supination and not wearing the proper shoes. I've been wearing these for about a week with the Pedag correction inserts and my pain has decreased significantly. In fact, I actually ran for a short distance today without pain. I am so happy with this purchase and will be buying another pair very soon.	2015-08-11

Shoe is not as sturdy as it looks but you can't beat the price. The boot looks more narrow and not as wide as shown in the picture. It doesn't have that 'beefy' look as most combat military style boots do, but does look more on the feminine side of a boot. The zipper in the back isn't the best quality, but so far seems to be holding up well after a few times being worn. I bought this boot for my daughter and according to her, it fits well, is comfortable and she hasn't had any problems with them during the few times that she has worn them. So far so good and will up-date my review if things take a turn for the worse.	2015-08-11

He has wide chunky feet, and we found the Daniel sneaker to be the best fit, and really cute, too.  We just ordered our third pair (from needing to size up).  The first two pairs have lasted until he grew out of them.<br /><br />I prefer the blue because they match with everything and don't show dirt.  Unfortunately, we have not been about to get blue in the larger sizes (perhaps Stride Rite is discontinuing that color?).  The grey is also cute, but the dirt accumulates over time (but, whatever -- he's a toddler after all).	2015-08-11

I noticed one of the reviews said that the strap color was &#34;spray painted on&#34; and I just disregarded it. BIG mistake!!

However, I think my patronage of this company has come to an end.  I have been disappointed by two purchases lately, including this one.  The problem for me is the cushioning particularly in the heel area.  After just an hour or two on a hard surface, like a city sidewalk, I start to feel discomfort in my heel, leg and/or hip.  It's the lack of sufficient cushion and shock absorption in these shoes.  I did not have this problem with Ryka shoes I purchased years ago (or with other brand shoes for that matter).  But this is the second pair of Rykas that has caused me this problem.  It's too late to return them.  But my lesson is learned.  This will likely be my last purchase of Ryka athletic wear.	2015-08-11

These are gorgeous! Fit perfectly! I have athletic legs, especially in the calf areas, but these are a perfect fit, with room still left for pants/jeans without having a &#34;baggy&#34; boot. The leather is quality and looks much more expensive than the $85 price tag. The quilting pattern just adds the cherry on top of that look.

For the price I paid on Amazon, I have no complaints. But here are a few quick points: The shoes run true to size but I think some feel they run large because the toe box is wide; there is very little arch support; while the shoes are very lightweight, there is little to no cushioning. In fact, I would say they are stiff; I have less than perfect knees and become keenly aware of the lack of support these shoes offer after wearing them for about 2-3 hours. However, for $28, I don't think I can expect much more.	2015-08-11

I've bought two pairs of the linked SL 72s and they both lean a bit to the inside.<br /><br />The item being sold here does not lean to the inside, which I prefer.<br /><br />A big downside of these shoes is that Adidas will certainly either discontinue them quickly, or at least Adidas will again keep the name and redo the sneaker making unwary buyers buy something different from last purchase (kind of like ROM sneaker from 2005 which became more like SAMBA sneaker a few years back).  It's already confusing that there are two sneakers with different fits that are both named SL 72. But even worse is when Adidas will cancel and not say what new sneaker fits like this one. Great manufacturing, great quality, good prices, awful marketing.	2015-08-11

I did a lot of research and consulted the reviews for multiple sets of boots, and I finally decided upon these for the fact that they were incredibly cheap, looked cute, and seemed like they have good traction.  I've only had them for a few days, but they seem to be holding up pretty well so far. The quality is pretty good, but I might need to buy new shoelaces because the one's that come with the boots are not long enough to lace all the way up, not to mention waxy and don't stay tied.  I LOVE the faux leather; it is so much easier to tend to and anything that gets on the boots will wipe off easily! The boots are also a little big, but I find that as a positive because I can wear wool socks with them once it gets chilly enough. Right now, they're not comfortable enough to warrant all day wear, but I believe it's because I haven't broken them in yet. Now all I need to do is figure out how to make my super clunky footsteps lighter so I can walk in these boots correctly. ;P<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend them to someone who wants boots that have good traction, and are fashionable and cheap.  I might update in a few months to see how they hold up to wear-and-tear, but for right now I'm a satisfied customer!	2015-08-11

On top of the aggravation of having to replace everything, and the pain of losing some sentimental stuff, I had to buy a new wallet and I am super fussy about wallets.  I like to have a snap front that opens up for my license and credit/debit cards plus a zippered side that holds random stuff like coupons, receipts, gift cards etc, AND a zipper coin purse on the outside. I also prefer red so that it's easy to find. After what seemed like hours of searching I found a few but they were $65 or more then BINGO!  Ordered this on Friday, had it by Monday and I'm not disappointed.  Seems sturdy enough, bills fit w/out folding, the credit card slots are pretty snug but they will loosen up.	2015-08-11

I have a huge problem driving at night, as I have night blindness, and the lights from oncoming vehicles make it very difficult for me to see well, so I was very excited to try these out.<br />They come in a great drawstring bag and a cleaning cloth, which I think is awesome, it helps to maintain them so they will last longer, and keeps the lenses from getting scratched if you toss them in your purse.  They have a rounded frame, so they fit perfectly on your head and do not fall, which I have issues with most sunglasses doing this, but not the Duduma.<br />And the best part is that they work great.  It does not cure my night blindness, but it helps immensely.  I have an much easier time driving as it takes away the glare from oncoming headlights, which is my biggest issue.  Unfortunately, I lost my pair, as my daughter's boyfriend decided to take them when they were driving home from visiting us, but since they were driving at night, and he had my daughter, I was happy to gift them to him ;)<br />I highly recommend these, they will help you see better when driving at night.<br />I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

For some who are looking for a casual ladies backpack then this is your bag. If you're looking for something more to haul school books in or go hiking or take as a carry on, i'll suggest something bigger. Please note its the richer color black and its the nice soft leather.	2015-08-11

These shoes are awesome, they really make a big difference in my performance at the gym. I have had trouble with my feet hurting after workouts, especially leg days, and these help tremendously.

It falls somewhere more towards a dark taupe. If you are wearing anything gray color, the shoe looks brown.  If you pair it with a taupe or tan, the shoe leans towards a dark gray...almost.  The shoe is sort of an undefinable color and essentially they matched nothing I wanted to wear them with. The would probably be more practical in black.<br /><br /> They also run a half size too small - short in the toe. I knew this up front so I ordered a 9 instead of my usual 8.5.  I have a medium width but with the 1/2 size up they did gap a little on the sides when I walked in them.  The foot bed was comfortable.<br /><br />They are a very cute shoe and would probably be comfortable wearing them all day.  However, because of the weird color I am returning them.	2015-08-11

I had ordered 2-day shipping so I'd have them for a fishing trip on Wednesday, August 5.<br />I actually wore the boots for a couple of hours on Tuesday evening, just to get used to them.<br />Very comfortable. I will say that the fit was a bit tight, due to all of the lining/insulation, but they will stretch out somewhat as I wear them.<br /><br />During my fishing trip, I hiked approximately 5-1/2 to 6 miles while wearing the boots.  It was a wet morning, and the boots kept my feet completely dry. They were comfortable to wear while walking in the woods/across rocks, and they provide good ankle support.<br /><br />I was unable to determine whether the boots will keep my feet warm in the  &#34;dead of winter&#34;,  but I believe they will. The insulation seems ample, and they are rated to -40 degrees, so I'm confident they'll  serve well as winter boots.	2015-08-11

They do run a bit large, I ordered a 9.5 but when I got the boots they felt huge. I returned the boots with no problem, other than the $17 return shipping. Ordered 8.5 instead and they fit perfectly. I've now backpacked over 100 miles with these boots. I'm always skeptical about waterproof boots as I have owned a few cheaper pairs that don't keep water out very well. These boots held up to 48 hours of rainy backpacking in Flagstaff and my feet stayed dry the whole time! Make sure you invest in some good socks of course. These boots have great support and great tread. I had great traction hiking uphill in the mud whereas as my buddy kept slipping and getting muddy. They do get a little heavier when wet because the outside soaks up a little water but they are super light to begin with and the inner booty keeps your foot totally dry.  I live in the valley so it gets 100+ degrees daily in the summer and these boots do really well in the summer time. They aren't as hot as I thought they would be since they're waterproof.

I am definitely ordering another pair in white or gray.<br /><br />I have not been given a discount or free product in exchange for my review it is 100% unbiased.	2015-08-11

I work in a two story restaurant, so not only am I on my feet for six hours a day and five days a week but I am also running up and down stairs during that time. After getting the shoes broken in, they fit tightly at first for the first week or so but that is to be expected, I found that these shoes never left my feet feeling sore. The only exception were on days I worked doubles (which would be roughly ten hours), but to be fair it would not  just be my feet that were sore but also most of my body.  They are slightly wide around the calf but not to the extent that it would bother me and I think it ads to the comfort of the shoe, although I would not suggest buying if you are petite and have skinny legs. As for style I like them but I am not in love, after being stretched out they did sag a bit causing them to look a little clunky at the bottom. I would still recommend these shoes for people looking for a boot that will last. I usually destroy boots within three months but I've had these for 5 without any major damage. The photos I posted are not of the boot when they were new but as they are now.	2015-08-11

What I noticed about the shoe is that both shoes are not the same. They are both left sides but one shoe is wider than the other and the mesh body of the shoe seems slack. Makes me wonder about quality control in the manufacturing of this product. One person might get a shoe that is o.k. while another would receive an inferior one.<br /><br />The shoe that was narrower, felt comfortable when I put it on  but I'm not sure if there is enough support in the sole of the shoe to wear it for a long period of time. The shoe, size 10, was a little large for me so I was thinking of reordering it a half size smaller but as I am writing this review, I think I won't take a chance because there is no free return on this shoe.	2015-08-11

Ordering online, you normally can't be sure what to expect.  But, of course, with Amazon's return policy...  Anyway, my son had been looking for sunglasses, and I'm always nervous about choosing something like that for him (something he would wear so often), but I was offered a discount on these in exchange for an honest review, and I thought I would at least give it a try.  Well, luckily he likes them, and they aren't chintzy (which I was afraid of).  So, yay!  I tried them on myself, too, and they give a nice calm green tint to everything.	2015-08-11

I just got mine today and I love it, I dont normally write reviews (even if the product is great) but this was absolutely perfect! I'm a 13 year old girl wishing for a Celine bag but if i ask it'll be the only thing i get for christmas. It doesn't matter anyways because I don't think its age appropriate for me, maybe when im older. but this bag is cute and stylish and i ordered a pom pom to go along with it and i cannot wait until it comes. Shipping was estimated about almost 2 months but it came VERY VERY FAST. (July 30 i ordered- Aug 10 it came) so happy. totally buying more!!	2015-08-11

The pictures on the product page show shiny black shoes, but what I received was greasy black.  I actually liked greasy style much better.

This is my third pair and I'll never get another work boot if I can help it.  Buying through Amazon also was the best way to go, least expensive and I did my shopping on this boot. Anyway, the boot looks nice, has great support due to its very solid construction and the soles are truly slip resistant. I wear it all day in the summer it's comfy and all day in the winter trudging through snow in 10 below.  This boot has never let me down. One thing for a buyer to consider and I'm cool with this, is that I have to get a new pair every 8-10 months.  Oh they'll LAST for years but for me after eight months through no fault of the boot or its quality, the leather just stretches and gets too soft to offer that first quality firm support. My feet will be fine for 8 months then they start to hurt again and this is why I think that happens.  Now, I wear the boot ALL the time, so keep that in mind. Also another plus is with other boots I used to put gel inserts in for extra comfort but I realized I don't need to in these.  The foot bed of this boot is so comfy firm and supportable its truly a wonder.  There. That's my review. Sponsor ME Ariat!!!  BRING IT ON!!	2015-08-11

Their great virtue is that while they're open and cool, they fit like a shoe -- no drag, no flop. They're great for wear on or around the water because they dry quickly.

(I'm 13 left and 12 1/2 right; the 12 fits just right on both; the larger-size Tevas do actually run a tiny bit large). BTW -- They last a long, long time. And they never chafe.	2015-08-11

Do the shoes need to be cleaned first? How much product do I use? How often should I use it? There is only a short description on the tin: &#34;Apply a small amount of the balsam onto the leather using a sponge. Work well into the seams. Do not use on suede.&#34; After some research, I decided to clean my boots with baby wipes and water, then dry them before applying the thinnest layer of shoe polish onto the sponge. I dab the sponge over the boots, spread the balsam out in circular motions, and let the shoes dry. It absorbs quickly in about an hour or two in warm weather. Over time, the black sponge provided in the tin tends to wear down and crumble when going over rougher stitches and seams.  I use Wonder Basalm once a month to restore shine to my smooth black Dr. Martens, which I wear as work boots. I don't think it conditions very well on shoes for heavy duty use--my docs are already cracking at the back ankles and base of toes. Granted, it's not the best quality leather, but the cracking is bad. By &#34;heavy duty use,&#34; I mean being on your feet for over 8 hours a day and constantly crouching and bending your feet.	2015-08-11

There's not a lot of arch support but that doesn't really bother me as it would for some. I keep these by my door in case I have to slip something on quickly to go outside, like taking out the garbage. They are somewhat wide but feet expand anyway in hot weather.

I had a pair of these in a 7, they fit perfectly but were snug at the end of the day so I ordered the 7.5 and they are loose.  They flop off my heels when walking.  I know these are relaxed fit and I have difficulty finding a shoe that fits right, but I was disappointed with both sizes.  I loved the way they looked, and I thought they would be good for my second job as a baker but it turns out I'm standing in one place more than walking all day and they really hurt my feet after about 6 hours.  It was weird, I really thought these would be great.  I imagine if you like the fit they'd be good for walking.	2015-08-11

Lately I am concluding that brooks makes the most comfortable shoes for walking around and for running. I wear these shoes on light trails and pavement with maximum comfort for my longer days 8-12miles since I am mostly a 5-8k runner. I recommend these shoes for anyone wanting comfortable neutral shoes or even someone whos looking for a great high mileage shoe. I rotate these shoes with a pair of Sauconys that have more support, they are great, only downside is the price.	2015-08-11

I measured my son's foot before ordering and ordered a size up because the size I needed wasn't available in the style I wanted. I'm glad I did because he needed the bigger size. At first the shoes were a little difficult to put on but once I stretched both sides I was able to get them on his feet. They look so cute- I ordered the red with the blue polka dot anchors. The bottoms of the shoes are nice and flexible, which is good because he's not walking yet and you want that flexibility for when he moves his feet.  My son will be wearing these to a beach wedding we're going to (with a matching polka dot bow tie!).<br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

I thought these would replace my severely worn out suede Vans. But in less than a year the sides started to split. It started small, with just half an inch, and now grown over two inches. I guess with price being affordable, they had to cut cost somehow... I repaired it with Bish, a natural latex glue, similar to Shoe Goo, but more flexible. So, I'm hesitant to buy another pair, even though I think it looks cool. Also the sole wears out really fast.	2015-08-11

These are airy, too, so my feet weren't overly hot. They did let sand through the aeration holes, but that was an easy fix, just shake them out.

I ordered my usual size 9 and the shoe is true to size. This was the first sandal that I've tried that actually cupped my heel.  However, the front of the shoe is narrower than I anticipated -- it wasn't overly tight, but I couldn't splay my toes and my big toe was hanging off the side.  My foot is not shaped like this shoe. I really liked the style, but I returned the shoe. At this age and stage, I always choose comfort over style.  If your foot was long and narrow (I'd say more of a &#34;U&#34; shape and not a &#34;V&#34; shape), this sandal may work for you.	2015-08-11

I wear the hell out of my boots as a landscape manager and have never had issues getting work boots to eventually fit. These though, the tongue continued to slide to the side and the interior rivets holding the lace-ups pressed uncomfortably on my instep. It got to the point where they hurt as soon as I put them on and couldn't wear them anymore.<br /><br />Additionally, they're huge! I feel like Frankenstein's Monster with those big old blocky shoes. I even have to be careful when driving my truck because the sides of the soles flare out and can catch the break or gas pedal.<br /><br />Finally, they are not as durable as you would expect. Check out my picture! The leather has peeled away from the rubber toe-cap revealing the safety toe underneath. This happened from everyday use. I ended up pulling my beat up &#34;Keen Utility Louisville 6-Inch Steel Toes out of the closet -  which are by far the most comfortable boots I have owned. Sure the soles are separating from the leather, but that didn't occur until two years after rough wear. If I could do it over again, I would have bought another pair of the Keens.<br /><br />Maybe Timberland will get it right after a couple of models, but for now don't buy these.	2015-08-11

The size fits well and I had no discomfort after having them on four plus hrs. I like having the three adjusting straps even though I didn't need to do any adjusting.  I change shoes a few times a day.  They are what I was hoping for them to be.  I tried another brand before which I liked the looks of but they were stiff and hard to walk in.  I do have a fused ankle and need a rocker style sole which enables me to walk without limping.<br />I was concerned about the price being more than I am accustomed to paying.  However,  the quality and fit are very good and should be worth the price.	2015-08-11

Happy they have items in-stock for Amazon Prime now.  First order took 2 weeks to arrive.	Edited 4/26/16.  Back for a second pair for my daughter, this time size 8.5US.  This time in pink.  This time it was Amazon Prime so I'm guessing there was inventory.  Build quality just as good as our last pair.   These sandals are a great price for genuine leather quality. I'd say they are equivalent to Stride Rite or Saltwater sandals.  Very happy with the softness of the leather and the good rubber sole. My daughter loves the sandals and the Velcro makes it easy for her to take on and off.  The Euro based sizes does make the fittment a little difficult. We needed a 6.5 but it looks like there is no 6.5US equivalent in Euro sizes.  So I preferred the 6 and it was too small. I returned for the 7 and had to wait about a month for it to fit. Shipping took about 2 weeks, from China I believe.	2015-08-11

I wear them to work	I have only had them for 3 weeks and, in my mind, cannot provide a fair assessment of the shoe after only a few weeks.  However, I have very much enjoyed them.  I wear them to work, (I stand and walk around on concrete for several hours a day).  As far as standing, they don't take the fatigue out of my legs or feet.  But they feel incredibly comfortable when I walk or when I ran around the neighborhood.  The added thickness of the sole is very comfortable and will definitely consider purchasing HOKAs again in the future despite the high price.	2015-08-11

As it was my first Clarks purchase, I waited for that sandal before making this purchase as I wanted to get the size right. During the wait I missed a good deal where the sandal was going  for $36.99<br /><br />The Wendy Tiger sandal fitted very well, however, this sandal (Wendy Estate) at the same size is too large at the ankle - the ankle strap does not fit; I will have to take it to the shoemaker to adjust i.e make it smaller for the ankle strap to provide a proper fit.<br /><br />This is not the seller's fault but rather the manufacturer's.  Really thought the same size in different styles would be the same size.  Not so.<br /><br />Still a lovely sandal.	2015-08-11

I made the mistake of pulling it out of the box, admiring it and then putting it away for 6 weeks.<br />My fault. What I discovered when it was time to use the purse is that it does not close in any fashion at the top. There is no button closure, magnets or clasp inside to hold or keep the bag even a little closed up. So if purse privacy or someone not easily reaching into your bag is an issue this is not the one for you. And once you put a few items in the purse it truly gapes open like a grocery bag.<br />I went back and looked at the pictures and sure enough there is a picture looking into the bag when it is empty and I did not put two and two together.<br />A real bummer as everything else about it works.	2015-08-11

I have purchased Bostonian cap toe oxford type dress shoes for over 20 years and have always been very satisfied with fit with the ability to wear them 12+ hours a day. My shoes usually take 2-3 days to break in and then they fit like a slipper. I am disappointed with this Andover model. The shoe never broke-in even after 4 months of wear (I was on assignment and was not able to return/adjust/ replace). The sizing from the last was terrible, the shoe bent at all the wrong spots and was uncomfortable, period.	2015-08-11

I've always been someone who can't wear flip flops because I need arch support or my feet hurt almost immediately. This year I was going on multiple beach trips and I needed a pair of tolerable flip flops. I did lots of research online and decided to buy a pair of these. I made the right choice and then some! These are far better then tolerable, they're a pleasure to wear.<br /><br />Made of obviously high quality materials, these have held up magnificently through a summer of abuse. I imagine they'll survive several more summers. The fit is 100% as expected, I usually wear a 6-6.5 in regular shoes. My research indicated a 6 would suffice here and that was correct. I have really wide feet, but these are wide enough that my pinky toe doesn't hang off the side. The arch support makes for a gloriously comfortable fit, even through long walks. There was no breaking-in period of discomfort, they only got more comfy as they moulded a bit to the shape of my feet.<br /><br />I bought the mica color first, which is a soft metallic gold strap with a coffee-brown sole and those look good with almost every outfit. I loved them so much, I came back and bought the Java color too. I, already eyeing pair 3!<br /><br />I paid $46 per pair, but I'd have paid double that for such comfortable summer sandals. You absolutely can't go wrong if you need some flip flops!	2015-08-11

I am really torn writing this review.  I bought a pair November 2014 and I would give them 5 stars hands down.  They were SUPER dark and just what I needed.  The construction seemed a bit cheaper & flimsy compared to some of my other sunglasses, but they were still durable enough for everyday use and did exactly what I needed them to do.  However, I cracked the lens recently--entirely my fault and opted to reorder a new pair (6 Aug 2015).  Put them on today and was shocked to find them barely dark and not fitting the 'hardcore black dark lens' as described.  I double-checked to make sure I ordered the right pair of replacement sunglasses; the brand and type matched exactly.  The only difference I found was the supply vendor--Nov 14: OverStockToyz, Aug 15: palebluedot, both fulfilled by Amazon and shipped Prime.<br /><br />I'm including 3 comparison pics.  In the first, you can see them side by side--original on the left, replacement on the right--and the right side is clearly a lighter tinted lens than the pair on the left.  The second photo shows an led flashlight shining through the replacement pair; the third photo uses the same led light on the original pair.  The replacement pair allow through substantially more light than the original pair.  Unless there were different batches and/or changes in the production process between my original order and the replacement order, I have no idea why they would be so different.  I'm in the process of returning the replacement pair and dropping the review to three stars.  So much for consistent product quality.	2015-08-11

It has so many great games. It was way ahead of it's time by having online functionality right out of the box. Unfortunately, SegaNet (the online service provided by Sega) has long since been shut down since 2001. Even though dial-up was largely the primary connection type at that time, online gaming on the Dreamcast was relatively lag free and smooth. I don't know how they pulled that off, but like I said, this console was ahead of it's time. Anyways, I wish the Dreamcast would've lasted longer during it's mainstream days, but there is a reason why it still has a cult following--it's a great console with a unique library of games that stand the test of time.	2015-08-11

I ordered two of these to match my translucent green x-box and they do match.  They're the lowest price controller I could find that matches. My main complaint with these is that both controllers I received were cracked and both center white stickers were peeling off.  To me this just shows that they're extremely fragile controllers and really cheaply made, which is pretty much what I expected. Like many other reviews say, these do have short cords(around 4 feet long) but they're long enough for my use.  Luckily the controllers both function and don't have any major flaws otherwise that I've noticed.  I will probably pay more and find a different seller for a higher quality controller next time.	2015-08-11

Since this is my first wheel I can't compare it to anything else but a controller but my experience with it so far has been great. I have drive club, the crew and project cars. First off, the crew is probably best off sticking with the DS4 but project cars and drive club become a totally different game. For this price range this is a very well built wheel. You can't ask for much but I think its ridiculous that the next step up (t300) costs as much as a PS4.<br /><br />I was skeptical about not having force feedback but I don't miss it as much as I thought I would. Yes, for a true experience you need it. But it doesn't kill the fun. I am using this on project cars and when you do make sure you check your settings. I even found some recommended settings on forums that helped a great deal.<br /><br />Like I said, this is my first wheel and if your looking in this price range you probably never had a wheel before either. Its a great entry level. It helps your driving with the right setup and that's all you can ask. The only gripe I have is the USB cord is built into the wheel and is not long enough. This can be corrected with $5 USB extension but if the main cord gets damaged in any way your screwed.<br /><br />All in all its quality \\\"cheap\\\\\" wheel. And if its your first you will love it. If you have the money then grab the t300 for sure but like I said at $400 I think its a steep price. Always remember though, settings, settings, settings. If you don't think it feels right out of the box adjust those settings before leaving a negative comment."	2015-08-11

I have banked 30hrs or so, created several different characters, and explored the world.<br /><br />Pros: Questing; although it's very linear, and redundant the quests are fun and rewarding.<br />  Character Development ; Extremely thorough, there are several sets of skill trees that accompany Class, Race, and faction. The creation is very intricate as well.<br />  Crafting: Very intricate and rewarding.  Materials are abundant, if you know where to look ;)<br />  Environment: HUGE, MASSIVE, INTIMIDATING. The world of tamriel absolutely comes alive in TESO<br />  Social: if you like online play, YOU.WILL.LOVE.THIS.GAME. if nyou would rather play solo, guess what? Bethesda thought of that and made tons of &#34;SOLO&#34; dungeons you can play alone, or just run in a public dungeon where you don't have to be in a group, but can still benefit from the help of other players.<br /><br />CONs: Graphics; the graphical environment isn't great, or spectacular, heck it isn't even really good. It's reminiscent of Oblivion, with more detail on the characters and NPCs, but pretty sub-par for a next Gen game.<br />  Tamriel: Now I know I said the world was a PRO, but it is also a con. It can be daunting to see the sheer scope of the world map, and how wide open and big it truly is. This makes following certain paths a little harder as it is easy to get distracted collecting quests to complete.<br />  Merchants: There are dozens of merchants, really they are everywhere, but mostly they carry the same items, and there is no item sorting, so even if you know the type of item you want to look for you have to search the merchant's entire inventory to find said item.<br /><br />I initially gave this game a bad review, but it has grown on me. I have found that I like questing in Tamreil, I just wish there was an offline option, but that's just my personal preference. Honestly I just hate not being able to pause a game. The server will also log you out after twenty minutes of inactivity e.g I had to poo, I brought up the menu and went to take care of business  , when I got back to the game the menu was still up, as soon as I exited the menu the game logged me out due to &#34;inactivity&#34; kind of annoying. All in all ESO is good enough to warrant Four Stars, but I think the fifth star will be reserved for an offline campaign mode.hate not being able to pause a game.

I wanted a PS4, but the PS4 is nothing like the PS3 in terms of media center hub. Our Xbox360 was like a jet engine, so that didn't help either.<br /><br />However, we have over 1,000 DLC songs for Rock Band (Xbox360), and they won't transfer to Sony's console, so that kind of made the decision pretty easy. We mostly use it for Netflix at the moment, if it even turns on at all (summer = rarely watch TV). It IS very quiet, so there's that, which is a huge plus for us.<br /><br />Games... I don't know. I got GTA5 with it, but I hate FPS-style games on consoles because I grew up with mouse + keyboard. So I bought GTA5 for PC, and have played over 100 hours so far. I bought my wife Dragon Age: Inquisition, but she's a PC gamer as well, and has been addicted to Civ5 all summer (school teacher, this is her only time to play).<br /><br />I'm sure there will eventually be non-FPS games (we love racing and sports and puzzle games) that will never come out for PC, so we'll eventually get our gaming in. Definitely when Rock Band 4 comes out this fall.<br /><br />I'm still unhappy that I have to pay for XBL just to use Netflix and other apps. I don't play online on the consoles, only PC. But I paid just so I can cry and complain about it, though my normal brain assures me that eventually I'll use enough features to justify the $32 (got it on a great sale!). Plus, I am well aware of the fact that paying for a premium service means the service is generally superior to others. I own a PS3 as well, and Xbox has always been better in terms of online services, though Sony has definitely caught up these days. So I complain, but in the end, I understand and accept. It's a first-world problem. I guess I'm lucky enough to complain about paying $32 for a luxury when $32 in other parts of the world could buy life-saving medicine.

The playing mechanics are quite simple.  You get a block, each corner of the block is 1 of 2 colors.  You try to match the colors to the blocks that are already on the screen to create blocks that have all 4 sides the same color.  That's it.  There is a line that goes from left to right that matches the beat of the song that is playing, faster song means faster line.  The sound track has some great songs in it and this game can keep you going for quite some time.  The only reason I took off a star was the fact that the songs always play in the same order, I would have liked a shuffling of the songs so each play through would be different.	2015-08-11

It's the only golf game on Xbox One*  The career mode leaves plenty to be desired. After three seasons of gameplay, it's pretty tired. And the character customization is pretty brutal if I'm being honest. Yes it's nice that I can use different grips and shafts for each club, but no I don't want to have to select it for my driver, woods, hybrids, irons and wedges independently.  Only thing left to do is play online mode. It gets a 3-star rating, but that's only because there's nothing else available on current gen consoles to compare it to. In contrast to the last Tiger Woods game, it leaves much to be desired.  *UPDATE 9/10/2015: As commenter &#34;TS&#34; points out, there is a current gen alternative to Rory McIlroy PGA Tour on Xbox One: &#34;The Golf Club&#34;. However, it should be pointed out this alternative has no association with the PGA, R&A, golf courses like St. Andrews and Chambers Bay, brands like Taylor Made, Nike and Cobra and with no rights to use the likenesses of professional golfers like Rory McIlroy, Jordan Speith and Rickie Fowler. But apparently &#34;it's a better game online, and it has developer's [sic] that actually care about the game, their customers, and who are continually coming out with updates to support the game and make it better.&#34; I apologize for any confusion my tongue-in-cheek review may have caused.	2015-08-11

I am soooooooooooo in love with the vita! For anyone looking for reviews on whether or not to buy this, I suggest it highly! ONLY if you are okay with actually using the X button as Back as O the enter, BUT only in the menu, if you have regular games from the USA, they will function normally. The colors on the vita themselves are fantastic, the color of the screen and lighting is great. I think the other reviewers didn't realize, that the brightness settings are very easily adjustable. My fiancé (who is the accountholder, I just do reviews for items that are meant for me.) Has a regular ps vita 2000, borderlands version, he bought this a few months back, they look and act exactly the same. (minus that his is a black one with a black back, and mine is a white one with a lime green back) I thought it was slightly smaller at first, but I realized that it was because he had a case on his, then it was the color difference. If you like having a unique vita over your friends, TOTALLY buy this vita!!!!!  The person I bought from was REALLY quick with shipping and the fact that it was in stock and they wasted no time!	2015-08-11

Didn't expect too much from this controller, just needed it to play my old PS2. WOW. This controller is pretty darn good, it's barely lighter than the Sony licensed controller, but feels on par to the real thing. The Dualshock vibration actually works well which surprised me as many other knock offs have very weak feedback. The only other things I've noticed is the L1 and R1 buttons stick out a lil bit, but it actually make them much easier to hit while playing. Also, the printing on the buttons is a little off, but it is only an aesthetic problem which in no way affects game play.	2015-08-11

Second, I'll keep this as short and sweet as humanly possible.<br /><br />I'm no UFC fan. Never have been, never seen a single fight. My forte is COD, Battlefield, RPG, etc. First time in this realm of gaming outside of classic Mortal Combat and Street Fighter. That being said, this game you need.<br /><br />Gameplay is superb. Combos are perfectly laid out and executed to perfection if landed. One can truly read the other fighter when skill permits. Also, skill levels are masterfully balanced.<br /><br />As for the story. This is a UFC game. The story is you're starting off at the bottom and working your way through lower division into the upper echelon. In which, you &#34;create a fighter &#34; and progress him through.<br /><br />Now, to the graphics. They are what you would expect for the 360. In addition, the slow motion camera will deliver pretty good knockout, jaw-rocking blows. It's nothing fancy but nothing short of what one would expect.<br /><br />To conclude, this is one of my new favorites. Going from almost exclusively playing online shooters, this game has forever changed my outlook on fighting games. It's constantly engaging. If your dominating your weight class, many opportunities arise to challenge the class above or below. Honestly, this game never gets old and from constant play, I understand why Amazon os trying to get you for  $60+.<br /><br />But go buy this game used for $39 at Gamestop!<br /><br />P.S. Taco Bueno is better than Bell ;)	2015-08-11

But for this game, localization was turned over to XSeed, and wow wow wow!!!<br /><br />You'll fall in love with every character- even the annoying ones. I can't name most of the RF2 characters, and I've had that game for years. A month into this, I could tell you everything about everyone. They're just so realistic! The gameplay is also vastly improved (thanks parent company!), and it's a game that has incredible replay value. Highly recommend to get this before it becomes impossible to find.	2015-08-11

I had read the controls were bad but I thought it might still be fun to play. I miss playing TH on PS2, but this is the opposite of fun and the controls really are frustrating and useless. They should have made the game to be used with the classic controller or if they make one for the Wii U it should use the pro controller, the game play just doesn't translate to the wii remote.

I have had this mouse for over two years and it has been a good one.  It took a little while to quit accidentally hitting the extra side buttons once-in-awhile but this was my fault, not the mouse's.  I have five grandchildren and try to keep them from getting into my office but lately I've found the mouse dangling from my desk by its wire a few times and it has stopped working a few times.  If I unplug the USB cord to the mouse and replug it it will begin working again.  Again, I am sure that it has begun not working due to abuse from my eighteen month old grand daughter after being let into my office.  My three grandsons (ages six to fifteen) have all used it while gaming on my computer and they like it, too, so it works well with all hand sizes, I'd say.  I am about to purchase another one just like it!  For the price I'll be glad if I get another two years but, if I can keep the grand baby away from it, I'm sure I'll get more than two years out of it!	2015-08-11

I thought when I bought it that I will get a different style of game but I was wrong. My question who in this day and age would play a game on their mobiles then buy it for Wii U. I was disappointed so my kids becausr when they saw the game they said, we have it on our i pads  Wont recommend it to those with i phones/ android devices. Otherwise it is a fun game	2015-08-11

I bought it mainly to prevent smudging since the vita is so glossy. The fit is nice and tight, but loose enough so you can stretch it out if you need to. One flaw is the fact that the start and PS buttons are covered up. I actually prefer the PS button to be lit up so I cut a hole in the silicone so that it was visible again.	2015-08-11

My son uses his wireless controller all the time with no problem but if we're playing multiplayer, it would turn on, then a couple seconds later off, then on and off. Its the same way on the computer it will work sometimes for $50 dollars and light use I would have expected them to last forever. If you are looking to buy one, and your reading this. I strongly urge you to NOT to buy it. It's a waste of your money and time. Will not be buying these for Xbox one either	2015-08-11

The best factor about it is how securely it will hold your game cards, as the metal casing with felt inlining is sure to protect the cards from falls, dust, or whatever else you fear your game card is generally susceptible to. There is also a nice latch feature secured by a button that prevents the case from swinging open, for extra security. The art on the case is a glued-on decal, and is not a part of the metal like I was expecting, but it's still quite a nice decal nonetheless. The only downsides to this case is that the decal arrived slightly scuffed up, but that's no huge deal, and could have happened during shipping. Speaking of shipping, the case arrived over a week earlier than expected, and the packaging was also great. The case is a good buy and is sure to hold up for years.	2015-08-11

The game is fantastic it really makes you feel like you are the Batman. But no game is without its flaws and there are three main flaws in the game that i think are the most damaging and those are:<br />1. The bat-mobile is practically shoved down our throats most of the game.<br />2. The boss fights are mostly short and weak in my opinion.<br />3. Most villains were sidequest.	2015-08-11

This is a game where the fun factor is the main focus of game, and it's really enjoyable for it.  The multiplayer mode can be quite a blast, and there are even Splatfests every now and then, where you pick from something like &#34;Marshmallow vs Hotdogs&#34; and fight against those who choose differently.  (Isn't fighting against those with different opinions fun?)  This is also one of those rare games, though a good amount of Nintendo games do have this feature, with a local multiplayer mode in it.  Of course, most in the age of online connectivity won't care that much about it, but for those who prefer local multiplayer or can't go online, this is a welcoming feature.  I just wish the servers are a bit better, as I remembered being able to play online on a weaker network than what I have right now.  This game also has a singleplayer mode, which is pretty light on the story and can be summed up in less than 5 minutes, but the levels are pretty fun, and I don't think the boss fights are that bad.  Your character is also customizable, though don't expect to go into a store in-game and just buy something for your Squid Kid.  You do have to play a few games online, up to level 4 to buy something from all stores, which isn't a big deal if you're able to play online.  Otherwise, this game is pretty much an addictive one, and it surpassed my expectations, which hasn't happened that much as of late.	2015-08-11

Easily snaps into place and is just as easy to hold as without the case.  The case hugs the GamePad perfectly while not obstructing any buttons or sticks.  As such, your sticks are still exposed, so don't think you can be reckless with the GamePad just because it has a case.  The Protector adds a very noticeable amount of weight.  The Splatoon artwork looks great and adds vibrant color.<br /><br />It's a little pricey, but it's very functional.  So if you love the Splatoon look and are looking to protect your GamePad from scratches, etc... it's a worthwhile luxury.	2015-08-11

I really got hooked on the Assassin's Creed series and was looking forward to Unity as I like this period in French history. Unfortunately - the game bombed in my book.  Average graphics (doesn't seem like the same quality), glithes and bugs and lagging throughout, too many odd and confusing command sequences added. Therefore only one star.  I hope future scheduled games improve - or is this a company that grew fat and lazy but still wants our money?	2015-08-11

HW-399M 2.4Ghz Optical Wireless Gaming Headset for XBox 360,Xbox one, PS4,PS3, PC, With Detachable Microphone	Video Games	5	14	15	N	Y	Looking for a good budget PS4/PC headset? Look no further.	Ok So I will break this review down into the categories I find most important. I will upload pictures as soon as possible.<br /><br />Construction/Build- So this headset is obviously a budget headset. At the price I paid (17.99 like new from Amazon Warehouse) it would be hard to complain unless this product was made extremely poorly. Well it's not. Although, being that I use A50's as my dailys, the comfort difference is substantial. These will not be the most comfortable headset you've ever felt, but it counters this by embracing it's cheaper materials. What I mean is that the padding is firm, but not too firm. This prevents the pressing of your ears causing them to ache after time. The earcups have no individual  flex, which is probably my biggest complaint. So if you have a bigger head, the bottom of the headset (where the cord is attached) will stick out off your head. But as said before, the padding counteracts this by making sure no pressure is placed on the ears, which is key. The headband is perfect and gave me no discomfort after about 2-3 hours of gaming. Both are made with very breathable fabric rather than leather, which prevents sweat buildup.  4.5/5 for this category.<br /><br />Aesthetics/Appearance - This is where this headset shines. I stream daily, and like headphones that are bold or cool to look at, and this headset nails it. I promise this headset looks just as good in person as it does in the images. The contrast of glossy/matte black with the blue padding is a real attention grabber, and frankly looks awesome. The mic (when attached) looks similar to a snake, and is much more appealing than a cord with a foam boom on the end. I wish more headsets took this bold approach rather than the boring dark colors. And to make this even better, the mic is detachable, which makes this perfect for wearing anywhere being that it only uses a 3.5mm jack. I've used this working out or just around the house doing chores, and looked awesome doing both :P 5/5<br /><br />Sound Quality/Functinality - Oooook the big topic, how does it sound? I am no audiophile, but I'd like to say that I have a pretty good ear for good sound. This headset will not dissapoint in any way. Bass is not overly focused on and is clear and tight. This is my preferance being that most gaming headsets concentrate too hard on just bass, making it sound very muddy and distorted. Trust me when i say these sound good. Hip Hop/dubstep/electronic music played through these has very punchy bass, which is exactly how it should be. Mids and highs are equally balanced, and not overpowerd by the lows, leading to a great equalized experience. They get much louder than they need to (which is a plus for some) and plug directly into your controller for a ps4. Now for the mic. The mic is decent, as in you will sound fairly clear and should get no complaints from your friends. It does not compete with higher end headsets with quality mics though. But it also sounds better than the super cheap mics that drive everyone crazy when it sounds though your talking through a windstorm. 5/5<br /><br />Summary - Fn Awesome headset for the price! Looks awesome, sounds great, feels nice. for under $25, it's only real competitor is the Sony Silvers, which it blows out of the water. If your on the fence, do it! You won't regret it!/><br />Sound Quality/Functinality - Oooook the big topic, how does it sound? I am no audiophile, but I'd like to say that I have a pretty good ear for good sound.

So far, this has totally saved our Wii U gamepad.  I'm so glad I looked for alternate solutions before spending the $100 to send it in to Nintendo to fix.  The cord was the problem all along.  We were having to unplug the cord from the wall and the gamepad, leave it for 12 hours or more before it would work again.  This new cord works perfectly and right out of the box plugged right in and the game pad worked.  So happy I found this!!	2015-08-11

It comes with absolutely minimal instructions and does not help you at all beyond the basic controls. I have never played a smash game before and I don't think I ever will again. It's extremely overwhelming and I'm not willing to put in the time to get good at a game if it isn't fun after 8 hours. I'm not bad at most games, beat DKTF no problems, 3D world I thought was too easy. Basically I have never put so much effort into trying to learn a game and failed so miserably as I have with smash bros wii u. I don't know what mode I'm even supposed to play to progress and don't understand the point of trophies.<br /><br />If you like smash bros and already have learned how to play you'll probably love it. I want to like it, but I don't. Never been so disappointed in a game.	2015-08-11

This was a great addition to the Assassin's Creed franchise.  It included the best of many aspects of past games, including: real estate improvement, passive income you collect from the bank, ships, a big city world (New York City) and TWO large ocean worlds (River Valley and Northern Atlantic), fishing/harpooning, hunting, and the assassin hunters that used the compass and whispers from the multiplayer games of Brotherhood through ACIII.  Vast acres of wilderness were like ACIII, vast oceans like ACIV, plus ship wrecks to explore, assassin contracts to intercept and defend, and a unique story told from the perspective of the enemy, all contributed to this game being particularly fun.<br /><br />The main storyline was short-ish, but not terribly so.  I do think they could have made it about twice as long in order to utilize more locations.  However, if you are a completionist, and enjoy wandering the world fulfilling tasks and collecting animus shards, this game offers plenty to entertain you.  If you just play the main story, then take it out, yeah, this may be a disappointment.	2015-08-11

The story and concept for this game are very intriguing, but even after many updates the game was still very glitchy/buggy for me.

This is probably the best controller I have ever owned. It is super comfortable and just the right size, and the addition of the touch pad was nothing short of brilliant. This really is the top tier controller design at this point....except for the battery life. For as much effort as they put into this controllers design, you would think they would have thought through things better when it came to the POS battery they included, and since it's not really removable, you are kind of stuck with what you get, which, given some of the other features of the gamepad such as the cool light, fairly well guarantees that you will get at best between 4 to 6 hours per charge. When you consider that a pair of AA batteries gets me around 30 hours of life for my 360 gamepads AND the fact that I can use rechargeable batteries for them, this was an unacceptable design choice on Sony's part, and as such, I knock a star off the rating to reflect this fact. It really is an amazing controller, but seriously Sony....get your stuff together and remedy the battery situation.	2015-08-11

Fun combat with mix of stealth and beat em up action that makes you genuinely feel like Batman. A zany Batman origin story many will love (though evidently it annoys some Batman fanboys?). There's also some small puzzles to solve. The Arkham series is actually very similar gameplay-wise to the Zelda series (puzzles, exploration, gadgets, intricate combat with lite RPG elements).<br /><br />The WiiU gamepad provides a map of all the collectables, objectives, and other things to see and do in Arkham City. This provides tremendous ease in surveying the landscape and finding fun and interesting things to do. It's invaluable to a game like this -- I honestly wouldn't want to play this game without the WiiU gamepad. Arkham City uses the gamepad more extensively, but I think many players will find Origins use of the WiiU gamepad less overwhelming.<br /><br />Other reviews mentioning technical problems with this game are pretty far exaggerated. In over 40 hrs of gameplay, the game only crashed on me twice (though in precisely the same gameplay circumstance). I never had any of the game progress killing bugs other versions of the game seemed to have. The game does dip below 30 fps more often then it should - making the fast-paced combat system a tad unfair as you can miss some important visual cues to dodge, counter, and strike. Other than that, Gotham City is bigger and more detailed than in Arkham City.<br /><br />There is some additional downloadable content missing other versions have, but from what I hear, you're not missing much. This game alone should keep you (and your kids) happy and occupied for a long while. By no means a perfect game, but one the best you can get on the WiiU for the price point.	2015-08-11

Came in the package unopened	I got the controller and it looked amazing. Came in the package unopened. The rapid fire works well.  It has different modes specialized for different games. Make sure you do not throw out the papers that come with it. They are very very important. Without them you would never be able to figure out the controller. It is a bit confusing because it is a stealth mod so there is no obvious buttons to adjust your mod. Read the paper and it will help you with everything you need. Overall this is a very good controller. It is surely better than the last modded controller I bought. If you are looking to buy a controller that can be used as a standard controller, with a black out design, or a modded controller then this is the one. The price isn't bad either since a standard controller costs around $50.  If you paid to have your controller worked on to look and perform like this one then it would cost much more than the extra $15 you pay for this.	2015-08-11

I would have to carefully toggle the power switch for my Gameboy to turn on. I thought that maybe it was a problem with the battery (the battery wasn't holding a full charge sometimes after charging it) so I decided to order a new battery, hoping it would fix the power problem.<br /><br />As you can see in the pictures, the battery comes with a tiny little screwdriver so you can unscrew the back which holds the battery. I have a picture of what the difference between the original battery and the new one look like and that the new one does in fact fit perfectly.<br /><br />Even though the new battery didn't fix the power switch problem (guess my Gameboy advance sp is finally starting to die on me, though it is over 10 years old) the new battery keeps a charge just fine so at least there's that + the little Phillips head screwdriver is a nice little bonus.	2015-08-11

Throttle notch makes this product incredibly frustrating to use seriously. Smooth throttle input is nearly impossible, as applying the necessary force to push the throttle out of the notch will cause the throttle to jerk forward or back. It's a seriously retarded idea to implement on an analog input. The stick also has annoyingly inconsistent resistance and feels very mushy all around, even after adjusting with the resistance knob. All other attributes are what I'd expect from a low-cost HOTAS. Low build quality overall, which isn't surprising.<br /><br />Wire joining the throttle to the stick should be a bit longer.	2015-08-11

Rather than flood the player with convoluted storylines and dozens of esoteric game mechanics, the creators have elected to go for psychological warfare and terror. This is present from the instant the save system takes effect. The game auto-saves after each battle, and before each judgment. There are ways to circumvent this limitation, such as online saves, but that defeats the purpose of this. Besides, I'm personally too lazy to utilise such tactics.  There are flaws that make the game tedious at times, but they're minor when the greater whole is considered. Personally, I would love preset party members that are commonly used. This would save time at pre-battle screens. Vision Quests could be streamlined to take up less time. Some battles can take excessive amounts of time, and their frequency increases later in the game. I am hopeful that these and other issues will be mitigated when updates and DLC are made available.  Combat is especially tedious, especially given how easy it is. Very few levels have your foes conveniently placed a turn or two away from your starting locations. Fortunately, Agito can teleport everyone adjacent to him (at later levels). This makes things much more streamlined, although carrying character levels over would mitigate the need for this. At present, only skill points are available over multiple playthroughs.  Players will be taught to empathise with their teammates, and the randomised traitors makes every playthrough unique. To add to the sense of urgency and consequence, the game automatically saves before each judgment, so be wary before making an irrevocable choice at the denouement of each floor.	2015-08-11

Here's some differences I've noticed from the DS version if it helps anyone	I've played EO2 for the DS and it was a great game. I heard about this one, which is basically a remake of Heroes of Laagard with a story mode tossed in. Seeing as Atlus games are rarer than hen's teeth I thought it was better to grab it now then in a year when this thing's $100 a pop. Was it the right decision? Was it worth buying essentially the same game twice? IS it the same game twice??<br /><br />Let's see the differences I noticed right off the bat:<br /><br />Firstly, all the enemies are now animated. They look GREAT. Also, if they're close to death they'll have different animations showing them looking seriously wounded and beaten up. And even a little sad. Great detail here.<br /><br />You have the option of starting a new game in Story Mode or Classic Mode. Story Mode uses a team of 5 preset classes and has a more in-depth storyline and includes voice overs. Personally, I haven't tried Story Mode yet but I plan to once I finish the game on Classic. In Classic Mode, you can create and choose from a giant list of character classes and make the best or most unusual team you can think of to take on the huge dungeon. My main team is Protector / Beast / Ronin / War Mage / Survivalist, and it's a bit unorthodox to say the least. But see that's one of this game's best selling points to me- Build your party any way you see fit, convention be damned!<br /><br />There's three difficulty settings that you can change at any time. PICNIC is super easy from what I hear. I hear on the picnic setting the FOEs jump in the lake and drown themselves. (No, not really, but it's way too easy for most EO vets). Next is NORMAL which is tougher but not as tough as regular EO. I'm playing on EXPERT, which is something I'd never ever do, but it's supposed to be the most like &#34;normal EO difficulty&#34; so that's what I chose for now to start with.<br /><br />Just like your main team, enemy formations can now also have a front and rear line. I think this is such an awesome addition, as it adds a lot of strategy and depth to the battles. This also means that a melee character (or enemy) in the back row can't attack the opposing back row.<br /><br />NPC portraits now blink. THEY BLINK. This is sorta' creepy in practice. I'd rather they had taken the extra code space and added more possible character portraits but oh well. At least it's nowhere near as creepy as that Pink food merchant in NES' Faxanadu. (Google at your own risk!!)<br /><br />The Survivalist character is actually pretty good now. I don't remember him being much more than the guy who mines for things and had crappy damage in the DS version, but here he has some decent bow skills almost right away (The Flank skill can attack an entire row of enemies for low TP, for example).<br /><br />When you clear a floor, you'll have the option to Floor Jump. This means that you can be anywhere on the cleared floor later and can instantly return to the floor's staircase at the touch of the stylus. This is hugely important when you're surrounded by FOEs about to kick you keisters, or maybe if you get a sudden case of Lazy-itis-majorus.<br /><br />There are Grimoires now (I've never played an EO game with these, but I guess they're in other installments too) that sort of act like Diablo's runes and can be attached to characters to give them different skills and etc (even enemy skills!) Further customization? Count me in!<br /><br />Early on a restaurant will open up in the town. Here you can bring the ingredients you've found in the dungeon and add new dishes to their menu. Just like the food in Etrian Mystery Dungeon, eating here will grant your party different beneficial effects for a short while. It should be noted though that these dishes are not free later, as you'll have to purchase them for en (game money) to gain their effects. NOTE: Except for the very first time you figure a dish out- you'll get the effect for free then. You will also be able to name your restaruant, and yes &#34;TACOBELL&#34; will fit. Go ahead and do it, I did. Nobody will ever know.<br /><br />Skills and Skill Trees are super improved in every way over the DS version. Before for example you'd have to spend a skill point on &#34;Sword Mastery&#34; which would raise your attack power with swords and eventually allow you to select other skills using a sword if you wanted to. Now, simply by raising your masteries those other related skills will be automatically learned for the cost of a single skill point (!!) This is great because it'll give players a chance to test out every basic skill and see if you like it without wasting points pumping into a skill that you'll never use later. The skill trees are also laid out much better than before. Extremely well done in this department.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed is that there's no way for me to view how many times I can TAKE / CHOP / or MINE anymore. It used to be right on the main menu along with the STATUS / CUSTOM / PARTY / etc. options but they removed it for whatever reason. Sure would be good to know this offhand!<br /><br />Day one DLC...... Well folks, it looks like there's just no way around it but almost every game company now is going to have this terrible model. If there's anything that Atlus does that's better though, is that most of the DLC options are free for a limited time. This includes the Highlander character class, original EO1 character portrait options, and some sidequests for example. Apparently, they're releasing more DLC all through this August 2015. I would recommend downloading the freebies at least, and maybe the ones that cost a couple bucks later on if you really think you can't live without it.per improved in every way over the DS version.

It's so much fun. I hate the daily clock, the eradia, and the fact that the game works against you. The player starts off at a disadvantage from day one because you need to use eradia to extend your time until the end of the world from six days to thirteen. To earn eradia, you have to complete side quests. The main quests earn you next to nothing in eradia. The game wants quantity, not quality, so you have to complete as many side quests in a day as possible. Even though I was running around like a crazy person and spending all of my TP to stop time (in order to give myself more time to complete quests), I still failed this game as I could not earn enough eradia to extend the time to thirteen days. Oh, and the leveling system is awful. You earn upgrades by completing side quests and quests from the Canvas of Prayers (which do not give you eradia). Without completing Canvas of Prayers quests, you have no chance of defeating many of the bosses in this game. I realize the game is designed so that players fail and have to play over and over again, but for me this is annoying. I like to power through games because I have little free time to play over and over.	2015-08-11

Except, unfortunately, the one that mattered.<br /><br />I purchased this controller so I could use the L and R trigger buttons with GameCube emulators such as Dolphin, but sadly the controller triggers just don't seem to have the firmware to support proper analog use where a light pressure has one result and pressing the trigger fully down gives the second result, a requirement in many, many, many GameCube games. Since this defeats the purpose for which I got the controller I had to return it. It's a perfectly serviceable controller, but not for what it's supposed to do, being a GameCube replica controller and all.<br /><br />If you want to be able to use proper triggers in games like Super Mario Sunshine, do yourself a favor and get a real GameCube controller from Nintendo and a USB adapter like the MayFlash one instead.	2015-08-11

But it's so off the wall, you can't help but want to dig deeper into it -especially as you can play as different characters good and evil from the story.<br /><br />There are no intricate dungeons with clever puzzles - just a big battlefield where you more or less just go out and kill everything. But there's this remarkable feeling of progress and success as you capture more and more of the battefield. The satisfaction of conquering the battefield always stays fresh.<br /><br />For the most part, you could button mash one button, use one weapon most of the game and beat it. Evidently that's what the Dynasty Warriors games are infamous for. But Hyrule Warriors rewards you taking out your enemies with some variety. As you master new combos and gain new items and pickup powerups on the battlefield, you learn new ways to kill more enemies faster. It's really awesome to see &#34;1000 KO&#34; pop-up on your screen after landing a string of magic attacks, power-up attacks, and other combos. &#34;Rush Battle&#34; - a scenario where you have 6 minutes to kill as many enemies as possible, really highlights this as what makes Hyrule Warriors so much to play.<br /><br />It's a really fun new take on Zelda games, one that takes the series in some bold directions that I think Zelda fans young and old will appreciate.	2015-08-11

Well, I had heard good things about the game and it looked good when I first put it in.<br /><br />The controls are cow manure, the story is really bad, the two man voice actors are okay and every other voice actor is just gross (as in racist imitations of ethnic groups gross, which I can sometime handle this being a period game and all, but these were tastless), the animation is borish and worse than amateurish (I am used to seeing overly sexualized women in videogames but the way they animated the female lead was like giving a horny 16 year old with the coordination of a toddler the role of lead animator for this character) it was not only painful but embarrassing to watch, the horseback riding mechanics were really poor, and although some people are okay with the duel mechanics I had 4 differnet people play the game each one taking a minimum of 30 mintues to win a duel and none of us understood exactly how it worked even after reading tutorial after tutorial online almost nothing in the game was intuitive.<br /><br />The things that were good include: the environments were really nicely done, the normal gameplay/ combat mechanics i.e. walk, run and shoot, the way the games equivalent to Rockstar's &#34;Dead Eye&#34; mode worked alrigh too.<br /><br />I don't think I could ever play that game again. I think the moral of the story here is that Eastern Europeans should not make a game about the American Southwest or Civil War, especially if all they are going off is old photos and a few cowboy movies.<br /><br />As an American, an animator, avid classic film lover and gamer this game just isn't worth the frustration or disgust.	2015-08-11

I love the paradigm system, and I especially like the improvements they made in this game: it's no longer game over if your party leader is K.O.'d! There's a ton of fun add-on content for this game as well (which is totally optional to purchase and not necessary for beating the game, but fun to play none the less). Don't waste your money on the garb. It does nothing for the characters or game play. I also love that you can capture, train, and enhance monsters in this one. It takes me back to the days of Monster Rancher. I think if you like the Pokemon franchise, you'll probably be into this feature as well. The only thing I would say is that some of the alternate ending bosses are made way too tough. I'm currently stuck on battling Caius with just Serah and the monsters. Even maxed out, her HP is not high enough to survive his barrage of attacks. I'm going to have to figure out an alternative strategy. Aside from that, it's a fun game.	2015-08-11

No wires, no cabling, no tethering to your controller.  Simply stick the receiver into one of the Xbox One's USB ports, press the button on the left side to power up the headphones and you should be up and running.  That simple.<br /><br />Two dials on the back of the left earcup control game/console volume (top) and gamechat (lower).  The boom mike is retactable and fully positional with LED indicating regular or bass modes.<br /><br />The headphones are quite attractive and neither look nor feel like a novelty.  The green LED afterglow lights are actually pretty cool but can be turned off if desired. They supposedly last 16 hours per charge via a USB cord, and after about eight hours I've had no drop off yet.<br /><br />The headphones are a tad stiff but easily adjustable and the cups are comfortable as well as the headpiece cushion. I've only found myself taking them of to adjust for additional comfort and only after a few hours.<br /><br />The sound is great and the fact that you can hear yourself through the Mic unlike other noise canceling headphones is a great feature.  The chat volume is easy to find balance for, and the game sound is top notch beating out my Polks.<br /><br />At $99 these have quickly become my go-to headphones and I plan to use them for a good long time.	2015-08-11

Nice addition to the system, since it plugs into the TV sound, it works universally for both my Xbox360 and PS3 (with the usb plugged into the Xbox360 for power). Sound quality is excellent, though there is some feedback (but adjusting the volume and bass accordingly will take care of that). Bonus, the headphones can be used with my PC without the dongle just as a decent stereo headset/microphone. My only minor gripe is that the split where the wire for the mic part of the cable is a bit short for use with the Xbox360 controller. I'd have to have the dongle almost directly in front of me in order to have the headphones plugged in and have the mic plugged into the controller. This makes the overall length of the headphone cord kinda useless since you're limited to the length of cable from the split at the end. Overall quality is solid, but be warned - the covering on the ear cups will begin to peel after extended use. The cups are still good (and comfortable), just the shiny black covering starts to peel off. Still, will buy again if my current ones ever give out.	2015-08-11

We have a household of 5 kids and when they decide it is a Wii U day they usually go through a set of batteries after one session. We are a busy family as well so they only play once or twice a month and still go through a set of AA batteries after each gaming session. This is just not economical for a family our size. This charger has eliminated the problem. It works with both the Wii and Wii U remotes and we have had zero issues putting the remotes on the charging cradle or the cradle not charging the remotes. Just a great product for our family and we have eliminated yet another reason to buy batteries.	2015-08-11

What can you even say about this game... the Bokumono update we've been waiting for. I'm VERY thrilled with the translation and localization work that XSeed provided for this game- after playing RF4, and comparing it to more recent Natsume localizations, I'm even more pleased that Marvelous is handing the reins over. Not since Harvest Moon 64 have I been so invested in a set of characters. Sure, the game does drag at times, but the interactions between your character and others, and even the NPCs, keep it lively. There's a bug in year 2 which makes your game crash... it's only happened to me once but that's a thing to be wary about. Street pass is.... interesting. My town is clogged with people. Not sure what they'll do but...<br /><br />Seriously. If you've been waiting to play a good farming game again, this is the Harvest Moon that we've been needing- no longer Harvest Moon due to copyright shenanigans, but it's the Bokumono we all grew up with and loved, and better than ever. Highly recommend.	2015-08-11

I feel kinda bad to trash it, since I got it as a present and hate to seem ungrateful, but this game isn't as great as some of the other WWE games. The main things that are disappointing are that the create-a-move and custom soundtrack for entrances are gone, along with a lot of the generic/past superstar entrances that could be used for your create-a-wrestlers. I'm pretty bummed by that, since I used a lot of those for my create-a-wrestlers.<br />For a good thing, the basic game play is still there and they didn't remove any create-a-wrestler parts. You can also have up to 100 create-a-wrestlers on the 360, which is pretty sweet. There are also a handful of the newer wrestlers and NXT guys, so that's kinda cool.<br />The 2k Showcase and Who Got Next modes are kinda interesting, but do feel a bit tedious sometimes. This is especially true in the Who Got NXT mode. The objectives in the Showcases actually pertain to parts of the story line, but trying to hit all the objectives in Who Got NXT can get frustrating and tedious, especially on higher difficulties.<br />That being said, the HHH/Shawn Michaels showcase was a pleasant trip down memory lane and the CM Punk/John Cena story in the other is probably the best story line the WWE had in years.As for the DLC showcase, I haven't downloaded/played it, but honestly, who wants to re-live the painfully one-sided Christian/Orton rivalry?<br />To sum it up, this game isn't terrible, but it's not the best WWE game out there, either. Hopefully, 2K16 will bring back more of the custom entrances and the ability to have a custom soundtrack for an entrance.	2015-08-11

I purchased this headset stand to use with my Ausdom M08 headset, and it does the job just fine. Spending more than $20 for a stand is something I just couldn't bring myself to do and this stand looked good.<br /><br />Assembly of the stand is simple, just pop the wire base and headset hook into the plastic back piece and you're done. The stand is a little wobbly but for my purpose it makes no difference to me. It also, comes with some company brand stickers.<br /><br />All in all, I like it and will most likely purchase another one for a different headset.	2015-08-11

But the games engine to determine the battle teams is flawed beyond anything imaginable. The match making design continues to allow most matches to end in complete routes with literally zero chance for one team to win or even come close to winning. You will hear from the developers that this is by design, to try and simulate war time confrontations. But soon after you have 20 battles in a row (in a game that is supposed to be fun) that end with your team losing by 12 tanks for more, you will understand. Don't waste your time and more importantly money on this inadequate game.	2015-08-11

It's beautiful and had enormous amounts of promise, but the gameplay is on rails and doesn't give you much room to do anything. I could live with that if the story, which seemed really promising, went anywhere, but it doesn't. That game doesn't end. It just…stops. If it were at least billed as Part I, I might have some sympathy for that, but it isn't. It's basically half a game with neither a satisfying conclusion to the story, nor particularly well designed gameplay.	2015-08-11

Buying from Amazon also offers a few more pluses: It feels more secure handing your information over to Amazon instead of Microsoft, you get the code instantly after ordering (not always though), and there is no tax for most people! I just wish the instant code service was a little more reliable. A few times already I've had to wait a few hours for the code to come.	2015-08-11

It is something you have to have patience for. It is definitely not a shooter game. But I like games like the new Batman Arkhams and Thief. The best advice I can give is if you get the game and start to lose your patience with something, turn it off and come back to it later. AND.. SAVE as much as you can. There are usually plenty of save spots you just have to sneak to them to save your progress. The visual effects on the game are stunning. I'm never the type to be scared but it does make you jump sometimes when the alien comes out of nowhere and guts you lol. It's kind of an extreme version of Dead Space in a way. Since you're going around fixing things in a space station taken over by an alien. Overall if you have patience and are ready for a challenge, I truly recommend it.	2015-08-11

The light on the back of the converter glowed a pretty blue color, but that was the end of its functionality as it sent no signal whatsoever to the television.

I never played the original arena game, but I wanted to see more persona 4 so I decided to pick this game up. It's a fun fighting game that perfectly blends the characters of persona 3 and 4 into a new genre. Personas are integrated into your fighting combos and it works very well. The story is great and the music matches the fighting theme. This is actually a sequel to the first arena game, but the original story is also available as dlc which was perfect for me since I never played it before.<br /><br />This spinoff succeeds in not only expanding the persona franchise but also in creating a beginner friendly fighting game. I highly recommend this game for fans of persona and fighting games in general.	2015-08-11

US	16129508	R2FBMJWG2NZXCV	B00003OPES	883704042	Deus Ex	Video Games	5	2	2	N	N	A Masterpiece	Deus Ex is arguably the greatest PC game of all time. It appears frequently at or near the top of best ever lists by both journalists and the gaming public alike. It was ranked #1 of the top 100 PC games of all time by PC Gamer, PC gaming's most widely respected publication.<br /><br />These accolades are no surprise when one sees how brilliantly the game succeeds on so many levels. The story is a masterfully crafted, globe-hopping cyberpunk adventure through which the player's character navigates a dystopian future world on a mission to unravel a Gordian Knot of conspiracies, secrets and lies. Both the player's character and the world he inhabits are shaped by nanotechnology, the former for better, the latter for worse. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, an agent of UNATCO, an international anti-terrorism organization. The terror he combats is largely attributable to the Gray Death, a nanomechanical virus that has ravaged the planet. Denton, however, is immune to the virus thanks to nano-augmentation, a cutting-edge technology available only to elite government agents. Nano-augmentation endows Denton with an array of superhuman powers such as infrared vision and invisibility. Augmentations may be customized to suit a particular playing style, for example stealth artists may opt for the footstep-silencing lower body augmentation while aggressive circle-strafing gunners can choose increased speed. The game's augmentations perfectly complement the open-ended design that is its greatest feature of all. Every level features secret areas for circumventing enemies, gathering intel or finding resources. These avenues might be accessible only with certain abilities, for example a fence might be surmountable only to players with the speed-boosting aug that allows them to leap it or the strength-boosting aug that allows them to stack enough heavy crates to climb it. Every mission can be approached in multiple ways using stealth, force, diplomacy or a combination of the three. The story itself actually adapts to the ramifications of the player's approach to the missions. The game is so open-ended, in fact, that there are only two required neutralizations. It can played as a straight-up run-and-gun shooter, a sneak-through-the-shadows stealth adventure or anywhere in between. Further complementing the open-ended gameplay is the RPG-style stat system in which players can develop proficiency in certain weapons or skills such as hacking, lockpicking, or even swimming. This level of freedom was unprecedented in shooters at the time of the game's release. Before, such games would tell the player  &#34;Go here, do this.&#34; Deus Ex, through the very end, asks: &#34;What do you want to do?&#34;<br /><br />Deus Ex is superb in other aspects as well: There is a great arsenal of weapons both lethal and non-lethal, familiar and futuristic. A favorite of many is the nano-edged sword, which when combined with footstep silencing aug, is immensely fun to assassinate enemies with. The weaponry is so well-integrated with the augmentation and skill systems that by the end of the game the player feels like a techno-deity. Although the story veers rather outlandish at times, the game never stops encouraging players to think skeptically. The graphics, from an artistic standpoint, convey the game world's bleakness very effectively. The game is set entirely during dusk and nighttime; blues, blacks and grays feature predominantly in its palette. The soundtrack never feels incongruous with its setting and the theme music is one of the most memorable in gaming history.<br /><br />Deus Ex is not a technically perfect game. Its graphics were somewhat dated at the time of release, the foreign accents are hilariously bad and the boss fights are a drag (though all but two are optional). These flaws do not detract, however, from what a monumental achievement this game is. Deus Ex may not be the most technically polished game of all time, but it is among the mostinfluential. Doom and Wolfenstein 3D established the first-person shooter as a genre, but Deus Ex elevated it to an art form. This was accomplished through its ingenious fusion of role-playing elements with familiar shooter conventions, giving birth to a new genre: the action RPG. The action-RPG has become one of today's most popular genres; echoes of Deus Ex can be seen everywhere, from the decision-trees of the Mass Effect trilogy to the plasmids of BioShock.<br /><br />Any game as influential as Deus Ex must be considered a classic, but to call this game a classic is almost an understatement. The defining aspect of video games as a medium is interactivity, and interactivity is maximized when players are granted as much freedom to shape their role within a game as possible. Deus Ex fostered this freedom to the utmost degree. Deus Ex was not only the instantiation of a new genre, it was and remains to this day, the highest instantiation of what a game can be.tein 3D established the first-person shooter as a genre, but Deus Ex elevated it to an art form.

My boys love playing the XBOX 360, but the toggle things are so worn out that they are really hard to use. Then one day I saw these Thumbstick Joystick Rubber Grip Cap by TNP Products and thought they would be perfect for the controllers. These little silicone things are great, they go right over the joystick and fit like a charm, and the boys loved that there were so many different colors. If you have kids and they play video games, this is something that you need to have around the house, I promise you will need them at some point.<br /><br />I received this product at a free or discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-11

I played a demo of this game in a store and I was hooked, I went home and ordered it. This game has limitless content, the ability to build your own tracks, great training levels and the ability to play multiplayer. The game does have its frustrating moments as some levels are very difficult but if you are a competitive person you will love the challenge. The visuals are also very clear which adds to the fun, the camera angles make it feel as if you are really on the bike and the learning tutorials are actually a lot of fun unlike some games where the tutorials are boring. The game also has humorous comments and sound effects that I enjoy.<br /><br />I can't really think of any cons in this game except for some of the levels that are very difficult but if you keep at it, you will eventually learn all the tricks to get through the rough patches but it does take some time and patience to learn thing such as doing backflips without crashing. Once you master it though its very fun.	2015-08-11

This game got me back in.  There is so much to do and explore in this game.  Gliding over the city or driving at break neck speeds is a lot of fun.  Many of Batman's famous foes make appearances.  There are many missions to complete including the main mission.  The story is really engaging and there are some moments that are heart breaking.  The one thing I didn't like was the weird tank battles they added to this game.  Batman's car can turn into a tank.  Uh, ok.  Besides that this game is amazing and I can't recommend it enough.	2015-08-11

I'm not much for DS games but I got pretty hooked on this. There were probably more options in this game then I have ever seen in any of the series. While this is a bit overwhelming for a while, having all these new responsibilities was fun and kept me playing. It's similar to most Harvest Moon games; managing a farm/ranch, making friends with villagers, potentially marrying one of the bachelors/bachlorettes and starting a family, fixing up your place and the town, and also participating in town events and contests. The game includes a few new mechanics including, making your own clothing from scratch, swimming, new livestock and crops, and the new trade depot. There are also new sheds to build for making new items including the pottery barn, sewing studio, and winery. This is a truly fun Harvest Moon game and there is LOADS to do. This game could possibly be too much for a younger player as it can be a bit confusing and make you feel like your just drowning in things to do but it's still a really great installment and a lot of fun to play around with once you get the hang of it.	2015-08-11

It's great and precise even without a mousepad, It also looks great with a nice blue glow. It works with both Mac and PC, and I assume it'd work with Linux. It's very easy to change the DPI (as it should be) the scroll wheel is nice and quick. It's is probably the best bang for your buck considering how cheap this mouse is, it's really a great product.<br /><br />The only thing wrong with it I've noticed is after a year now of using it the yellow cobra logo and yellow text above it has faded quite a bit. Which still isn't that bad after over a year of use, and it's price.	2015-08-11

I've been playing this game for a few weeks and I really like it.  I played the demo on the PS Store, and my character from the demo transferred into the game.  It was nice starting at lvl 7 from the start.  This game reminds me a little bit of Gauntlet or Gauntlet Legends, in that it's a dungeon kind of a dungeon crawler with the classic overhead view.  The game is pretty deep as far as customization options go for your character.  I have already reached Act V and I feel like I'm just kind of scratching the surface of the weapons/jewels system.  I will definitely be playing this game again (probably several times) so that I can pick a different character class and see what that's all about.  Being new to the Diablo series, it didn't take me long to figure out the story lines, etc.  It's not the most in depth story, and I honestly don't give a crap about a lot of the characters back-stories, but man, the gameplay itself is addicting.  I am OCD and have to cover all of the map before I can move on and that has turned out to be pretty rewarding.  I haven't gotten in to the expansion stuff yet either, but so far so good.  I never have gotten my &#34;Legendary Item&#34; from battle.net though, and I followed all the instructions on the website etc. but with so many other items in the game I'm not that worried about it.  There are endless items in this game with 100's of different attributes and benefits.  I needed something to game on this summer while I save up for a PS4, and this is going to provide many hours of entertainment.  Well done, as usual, Blizzard.	2015-08-11

I've never been a Sony guy but the PS4 and Vita are really the impressive consoles this generation, though I'm not entirely sure if I like the Vita more or less than the 3DS.  I do wish the Vita had the same XMB as the PS4 for a much more streamlined user experience but we can't have our cake and eat it too.  The games have all been pretty good so far and PS+ gets me plenty of extra games to go along with it.	2015-08-11

How in the world this can be so highly reviewed is beyond me! First off the Kinect is too heavy for the click in place bracket to stay clicked in place. I had to get mine to the right spot and then super glue it at the click in place hinges. Secondly there is no part of this thing that would remotely cover the lenses on the Kinect. There are far better options out there for slightly more money to choose this one. They say you get what you pay for... Apparently I paid for a piece of CRAP!!!	2015-08-11

And it does not disappoint. The Batmobile is added as a third leg to the game dynamic (the other two being brawling and stealth) and it functions well in both racing and tank combat modes. By the end of the game you will find yourself getting a little tired of the repetitive tank combat, but beating the bejeezus out of group of thugs with your bare hands while muttering &#34;I'm Batman&#34; will break up the tedium.<br />Why 4 stars? Well, the tank combat gets boring, there's another huge glut of Riddler fetch quests, and pathing bugs on armed goons (oddly only happening to me during Origins but not the other two) during the predator sections all detract from the game. End of the day though you get to glide through the air, dive tackle a goon, and proceed to beat the tar out his friends until they run away in terror. All in a days work for the Batman.	2015-08-11

I played kingdom hearts when I was a kid and as a college student now, I find that the original story is a little cliche. However, the amazing worlds that Disney and square enix created are as awesome as I remember in kingdom hearts 2. Unfortunately, the 3ds game was only put in this collection as a long cutscene movie, but I appreciate the fact that I could watch it to see roxa's story. Chain of memories also helped me understand the story between one and two.<br /><br />Overall, if you never played kingdom hearts before and want to enjoy the magic, go ahead and buy this collection. It's a great place to start, especially if you don't have a ps2 or enough money to buy the consoles for the old kingdom hearts games.	2015-08-11

However, downloading the game was an issue.  I HAD to begin an account with Sims online in order to download the game onto my computer and as for the Hidden Springs edition, you have to purchase it, in part, on the website for so many Similoneans.  So when you purchase this, you don't get the ENTIRE game(s).  I'm sorry if I spelled anything wrong, on here.  I wanted to get this posted and up quickly.	2015-08-11

Went through multiple installation attempts, each time the update was installed via USB and the PS4 would restart and the system would crash. Tried several WD Greens, 2TB, 3TB, and a 4TB WD Red. Tried formatting to eX as recommended. Tested drives in a PC and they work just fine. Took everything apart and re-seated everything to the same results.  I swore I would never buy another product from Nyko after their inter-cooler burned out the video board on my Wii, and now I know I never will.<br /><br />Even just in the install loop that I was getting stuck in, the unit runs EXTREMELY HOT. The ps4 is clearly not made to be having this additional power being drained. Even if the product works for you as advertised, I'm willing to bet it will shorten the life of the console. Heed my words, stay away from this terrible product.	2015-08-11

Haha it really feels like you're working out, but at the same time you really don't notice because you're focused on passing the challenges and beating your opponent! And i love how the game puts YOU in it! It's not like other kinect titles in which a character from the game moves as you move, it digitally puts your image in there! You can watch your form and laugh at some of the challenges you do, like this pushup challenge in which you do push ups but they stack things like a plane, elephant, etc. on your back! It just looks hilarious! Lol It's a little hard at times since it's still basically exercising, but all in all, its a fun, fun ride!	2015-08-11

I normally don't review video games but this one I will make the exception.<br />I heard about this game from a friend and Anime Expo. I was very intrigued by the whodunit mechanics and decided to buy it without any other reviews or ratings to go by. Now I'm not very far but I can say right now I am throughly enjoying this game. It is slow paced and even a little repetitious at times but I cant stop playing it!<br />I'm hooked on knowing more about the story even if it is very simple and I love all the characters and have grown very attached to them. Killing off the traitor has been very emotional for me.<br />My only problem with this game is that I don't see much replay ability. Aside from different traitors that look like the only thing that does change.<br />I did get a ton of free DLC. Costumes and exrta missions which add to the story. Not sure of they will be free for long but I'm happy Atlus offered them. Some reviews said that game was too easy. I am having a little difficulty with it myself. My party members get ganged up on then die and reviving them is pointless becuse they will get ganged up on again and die. And even if leveling and suiting up your characters are a little simplified compared to most RPG's this game still has a nice bit of customization and it makes you want to level up your traitors so you can extract their best abilities for your own use.<br />I won't prattle too much longer. Just all in all I love this simlple game. It has engaged me while lately I'm having a hard time playing other games I have started. So if you want simple good anime rpg fun get this game! Im certainly enjoying it.	2015-08-11

I miss the chaos of Vaas in Far Cry 3 but Pagan Min seems to be an acceptable replacement. Far Cry 4 maintains the random animal attacks however, they are much more embarrassing now as instead of a crocodile, one might be attacked by a honey badger. There is a lot to do so the story does not seem too short. The game arrived in discs and was easy to install, however, I still hate the requirement to go through Uplay which is quite inconvenient for a Steam gamer. Also, Windows 10 users beware as this game has refused to start multiple times since I downloaded the new OS. Overall though, solid game.	2015-08-11

Does the game live up to the hype?<br /><br />You bet it does!<br /><br />This is a must have for any ps vita owner. I never played a persona game before, but this game made me a fan.<br /><br />What's great about this game? Well, first of all, from the opening video, you can tell thus game was perfect for the vita. The vibrant colors of the game are reflected on the PS vita's amazing iled screen. Not to mention the unforgettable soundtrack. I love every song in the game and the main composer of the game, Shoji meguro, has a unique style to his music.<br /><br />Gameplay involves solving a murder mystery by dungeon grinding while living out your school life in between battles. The best part of the game has to be the character interactions you have as you progress through the game. You will love every single one of them, and none of them are as simple as you think! The vita version of the game also adds a new character for you to know. Although I wasn't a big fan of the character, it was still a nice addition to the game.<br /><br />Overall, persona 4 golden is the pinnacle of a jrpg. It's got the story, the music, the gameplay, and the characters. If you dont have the game yet, go get it now. It's just that good.	2015-08-11

It is rather difficult, but if you've ever played DKC games they always are tough. You really have to earn it if you want to beat the game, they definitely don't just give it to you. I felt like other games *cough cough* NSMBU and Mario 3D world just let you beat the level if you died more than 5 times by giving you invincibility or letting you watch a walkthrough with the option of not having to do it yourself. Not this game, you'll die a lot, but its very rewarding.	2015-08-11

It came with a disk for the drivers and manual. However, the drivers it came with were fake or broken. When you try to use the drivers it comes with, windows alerts you that it found the drivers, but they couldn't be installed because they were corrupted or broken. It even admits to being fake in the title of the drivers, as it says &#34;Could not install drivers for 'Microsoft Xbox 360 Adapter Fake' because...&#34;. Now, this is fixable if you buy it. You can just ignore the drivers it came with, download the official ones of Microsoft's site (link to guide for fix: https://krisrowland.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/fake-microsoft-xbox-360-wireless-controller-adapter-in-windows-7-64-bit/). So, the product they give you is incomplete, but with thirty minutes of tinkering, it will work.	2015-08-11

I have a high amount of confidence with this controller. If you are looking for a good (maybe pricey) bluetooth controller, look no further. It has two modes A and B, the A is optimized for some games but most of the time I just use B mode which is the regular bluetooth pairing.

This game is an amazing amount of fun, especially if you like Elite Beat Agents or Dance Dance Revolution. The music of Final Fantasy is given a chance to shine here, and most of it is extremely enjoyable.<br /><br />Gameplay: I am most comfortable on the Basic difficulty level. I got some exposure to harder difficulty in the Quest Medley mode. That helped me to refine my timing, but the overall experience on the harder difficulties is much more stressful. Basic is the best way to just enjoy the music and tap and slide along to it at a comfortable pace.<br /><br />There are so many characters, items, and RPG elements included in the game, but I am not sure what most of them do. There is so much to do just in playing all the songs and modes that I have not hit bottom yet of all the options. It is fun to unlock the trophies in this game. Some will just happen naturally, while others you can figure out from the hints on the trophy records page.<br /><br />This game is a love letter to Final Fantasy and its music, and it is one of the 20 best 3DS games.	2015-08-11

If you want to stream movies from Netflix or HBO it's not really an option. If you want to game online pay up!<br /><br />Once you've decided to subscribe the cheapest and safest way to pay for your subscription is through a gift card / online game code. Amazon seems to always have a lower price than Microsoft (or any other retailer) and you only share your credit card information with Amazon. If Xbox Live ever get's hacked like Sony did you'll have one less thing to worry about.<br /><br />The redemption process is simple, sign into xbox.com and redeem the code!<br /><br />Simple as that: cheaper and more secure!	2015-08-11

I remember really struggling with some of the WoL on hard, particularly the last mission &#34;All In&#34; which took me about twelve tries. On hard, I beat the final HoTS mission on the third try, and I don't even remember its name which goes to show how memorable it was.<br /><br />They did some really interesting things with the HoTS campaign, and there were some really fun missions, but playing through it, it really feels as if only 50% of the effort and care that was put into the WoL campaign was put into HoTS. I could have even put up with the downgrade in mission quality/variety if there had been a solid plot, or vice versa, but the single-player experience with HoTS really feels rushed, incomplete, almost as if it were an afterthought, something &#34;compulsory&#34; that had to come with the expansion with the focus being on changes to the multiplayer mechanics.<br /><br />Taken on its own, the campaign is fun or I wouldn't have even played through it. It's just so underwhelming compared to WoL.	2015-08-11

For now, I'm only testing this gun on PC so I can't speak to using it with PS3 games and how well it performs.  Pros: - Appearance: Not to be shallow but this gun just looks awesome-it's modeled after the m4a1 rifle used by the military. Camo is cool but some might prefer black. -Easy-setup: Just plugged the USB dongle in PC and, using controller mapping software, the gun was up and running. -Move compatibility: Could be used on my PS3 with Move if I desired. -Fore-grip and stock: First time I've seen a fore-grip on a peripheral gun and it does ease prolonged handling when compared to the Sharpshooter and how its significantly more front heavy. -Buttons: Has all the buttons on a PS3 controller and an additional thumb-stick compared to the Sharpshooter. -Lightweight: Weighted both guns and the Force Elite is much lighter than the Sharpshooter (fully loaded). -Rumble: Gun mimics rumble of PS3 controller (albeit, kinda weak). -Handling: It's comfortable to hold and handle. -Army licensed: Can't remember Army ever doing this but it's cool that their involved. -Scope: Not at all useful for my VR setup but cool looking nonetheless.  Cons: -Thumbstick: It's smooth compared to the rough surface of its controller counterpart. -Button placement: Alot has been commented about this but my hands adapted pretty fast to tight placement of the buttons. The only other issue is the thumbstick on the handle and how my thumb would constantly bump on the area right above the thumbstick. -Trigger: There's a little too much friction when pulling; Sharpshooter is smoother by comparison. -Price: at over $50, it's more expense than most of its competitors but, in my opinion, all of its features justify the price premium. -Iron Sight: This is Nitpicky, but CTA should have chosen the classic M4 ironsight (surprise Army didn't insist); it's removable so it's not a big problem.  I was seriouslyconsidering this or the Top Shot Elite and I couldn't be more happy with my choice. It looks and handles wonderfully and I would recommend it to others who are in the same VR preparation as I am.	2015-08-11

I also rarely play online multiplayer games, but when I do I have been frustrated at being the only one not able to communicate.  These did the trick.  When the arrived I panicked because they clearly look to be designed for the PS4.  Also they looked pretty big and my head is fairly small.  So when I finally had some free time I sat town and discovered that they do plug into the PS4 remote and the PS4 acknowledged that they were there.  So I fiddled around with them but was confused at first because the sound kept coming out of my TV.  It wasn't until I was in the multiplayer that I realized that only conversation with other players was coming over the headset.  I could hear them okay and they said that they could hear me - so on that end it seemed to be working.  Having the headset on was frightening to my dogs - who believed that I had become a Borg.  I had to put it on and take it off several times before they went to their regular gaming snooze locations, finally convinced that I didn't require help.  The fit was fine, and it wasn't uncomfortable to wear.<br /><br />Final thoughts - if you are a casual gamer who just wants to talk to people occasionally while playing - this will work for you.  If you treat gaming like it's your job - you may want to spent more money.	2015-08-11

The only downside that I can find is that if your party leader gets K.O.'d, it's game over. It can also be difficult because you can only directly control your party leader, so if you need to use a specific character's ability or summon, you need that character to be the party leader because there's no way to ensure that the computer will auto-cast those spells for you. Unfortunately, some of the characters with the most useful abilities are also physically the weakest. For example, Vanille is the only character that can cast Death, but she has thousands of HP less than other characters, so if you're battling a tough monster (e.g. Ochu), she will probably get K.O.'d a few times, forcing you to start the battle over. I did appreciate that effort was made on the part of the game designers to curb the amount of time needed to level up your characters. For the majority of the game, you don't need to go out of your way to grind levels. It will level up through normal game play. They also added side quests when the game does slow, forcing you to grind, so that rather than relying solely on random encounters, you can work toward goals which will actually help your characters acquire better weapons and accessories in the process. Overall, I found this game to be enjoyable. I'm finishing up the last of the missions now, then going back to battle the final bosses again.	2015-08-11

It does have above decent graphics and the beginnings of a good storyline. The fighting style is very hard to control and takes some getting used to, but I got used to it after first hour. The character dialog throws you off a little as it is mismatched to their lips and looks like a Playstation 1 mouth speech engine lol. I got a little tired of the constant close quarters trails intertwining and confusing trails, broken up only by the open-air combat areas. I could always tell when I was fixing to run into some enemies because the terrain would go from narrow passages to a space where you could actually move around a little. I played this game for a little while until DAI came on sale, which I bought and am very satisfied with. I have not attempted to complete this game as I was only half-way compelled to play it. In my opinion, a good game should make you think about it while you're at work instead of a last resort on a Tuesday night.For $20, it had the makings of a good time filler in between great games. I recommend picking this game up on sale and enjoying it when you're between games.

It's storylines are one of the most strange out there and this is no exception.<br /><br />While the characters and setting are interesting, I find that the occasional comedy in this game to be very unfunny and that it distracts you from the main plotline.<br /><br />The gameplay is solid, but it is dragged down by the HORRIBLE fps drops. They constantly slow down the game and made it almost unplayable for me. How such an average looking game can run so poorly is beyond me.<br /><br />If you have already played the previous drakengards, go ahead and buy this game and enjoy the story. Otherwise, play the other drakengards. They are much more polished and are overall better games.	2015-08-11

I thought I had a problem with my Saturn so I almost opened up the console and risked damaging it rather than learning that the cart can be unreliable. I went to the Saturn forum to show everyone a picture of my console's cartridge slot to see if that was the problem, and everyone told me that it's the cart, as the slot looks fine.  A cart like this is a necessity for Saturn owners (especially in the US and PAL territories), but if a product doesn't work, then it's a bad product. I have moved past and purchased an Interact GameShark, which is working perfectly!   But also be weary of the GameShark: The board inside the cart is larger than an official memory card, so constant removing and inserting can damage the pins on the Saturn's cartridge slot. The trick is to put the GameShark in and leave it. NEVER take it out unless absolutely necessary.	2015-08-11

Season with a bit of Total Recall, and then stir it all together with some wicked wrestling, and you get HYBRID HEAVEN!<br /><br />This is one of those titles that requires the player to move past initial assumptions. Give it a go, and forge ahead through the strangeness, and I bet you'll get as hooked on the plot as I did. The combat mechanics essentially takes some of the best wrestling visuals (of the time) and ties it to a turn-based system. You can maneuver while your action bar fills up, and then unleash powerful suplexes and submissions to put a world of hurt on alien scum.<br /><br />There is also a bit of third-person shooter, but basically you use a pop-gun to zap security drones, while avoiding devious traps and deciphering puzzling mazes. Just when you think you got it all figured out...<br /><br />An excellent title. A MUST for N64 fans. Now if only they'd do a sequel...	2015-08-11

If it wasn't the only card that worked with the vita, I would have bought something else.	2015-08-11

Bought this on EB, but I don't think it deserves a 1star rating.  Yes, it's pretty basic--it's meant to be for us &#34;Dummies&#34;!  For $6 this game offers hundreds of practice hands.  Perfect for my needs, as I'm in the process of just gaining experience with &#34;odds&#34; and other &#34;hand calculations&#34;.  The &#34;Poker Coach&#34; in Practice Mode is just mediocre, and I tend to ignore the coaching.  Like another reviewer stated: you have to &#34;win&#34; your $10,000 by playing limit games to be able to play the &#34;no-limit&#34; Texas Holdem.  Major flaw in software design, as the buyer/user should be able to play No-Limit without built-in requirements.  Again:  for $6, it's good enough for what it is.	2015-08-11

I have no idea how anyone can give this game a review any higher than 1.  The controls were horrible. The left analog stick controls the steering but it also controls the rear view, this means if you turn but the analog stick goes down ever so slightly you all of a sudden are looking backwards.  Try driving at a fast speed while fighting enemies and the view constantly keeps going to the back of the car, it's pretty hard. The graphics are dated, the locations all look the same.

US	8462721	R3QBMWJCETA30S	B00D7QXAY2	722298880	Rayman Legends	Video Games	4	0	0	N	N	RAYMAN!!!	I will be splitting this review into to 2 parts  1. Content  2. Should you buy it / Final Thoughts<br /><br />1. Content Rayman Legends is the successor to the game Rayman Origins which is also on the Vita. Rayman Legends is a 2D side scroller action game. If you played Mario games then you know what your getting your self into. You control Rayman and complete various levels every 2 to 3 levels you will have to control this character named Murpy while playing the Murpy stages you cannot control him  you have to use the touch screen or touch pad on the vita to control him also using the Gyro senser from time to time. The graphics of the game are Amazing. I do own Killzone Mercenery and in my opinion I think this is about the best graphics you can get on the vita. if any game on vita was going to impress your friends in terms of consol graphics on the go this would do it. Now this game is packed with content you have the main game which the story is just average nothing to blow you away and then you can unlock new characters to play as I think around 20+ there really just skins they dont really play diffrent from each other  you also got challenge mode plus the edition of Kickfoo which is a soccer type mini game. There is no game plus or extra world to unlock for 100% completion however the coolest thing that ubi did is bring back some of the best stages from Origins and put them in Legends as bonus stages around 30 or so levels from that game. To unlock them you have to use these shamrock type scratch tickets in the game. The game aslo has 2 player co- op but no one I no owns a vita sadly. The best levels they included in the game are these music type stages were you run and jump to the music in the background there very innovative. Over all for the price and as a platformer Legends is packed full of content from start to finish dont forget when you get the game to update it they added 25 invasion levels free  there clock based speed running levels. The vita versionalso has 5 Murpy levels not seen on any other consol. The music in each level feels like it should be in a movie thats how good it is. None of the music gets stale its very good .<br /><br />2. Should You buy/Final Thoughts - This is by far my favorite Vita game I would go all the way to say I would put this in my top 10 even top 3 vita games of all time. Now you may be asking your self why I gave it 4 out 5 star when I gave it so much praise. I really want to give this game 5 star but the thing that ruins the game for me not giving it a 5 star is those Murpy stages with full Touchscreen gameplay and Gyroscoop controlls tilting the system Who at Ubi soft thought those levels were a good idea Who???... I never liked gimmicky type stages but to be fair they do work well. Im not into touch screen cellphone type games that use only touch screen but thats just me you may actually like those stages. Its kinda like when the Nintendo DS came out for the first time and devs were trying to use the touch screen all the time just because it was there. I found my self having to hold the Vita in one hand when I play the Mupry stages which makes it hard to play the vita.I just really love the game Allot!!! But the murpy stages subtract 1 star. Also to mention the game only has 1 game save file so if you and your family or friends want to play the game they will have to delete your game save to start there own unless they have there on vita agian I dont know why they couldn't easily have 2 to 3 game save files which bugs me a little. Even though Murpy stages are there and no multiple game saves  its not enough for me to give this game a very bad score when this game has allot of content and beautiful graphics on vita maybe the best bang for your buck on Vita. Overall I Would deff recommend this game to any vita owner its worth every penny of the admission price to play. Should you buy it on vita or another consol? I do love the game so... much I actually bought it on the Wii U as well but what I can say is there almost identical expect the vita has 5 new murpy stages and obviously you can take it with you wherever go. I would get it on vita without a doubt in my mind this may be my favorite 2d platformer this gen on a handheld. If you were wondering this game is not on 3ds they did give 3ds origins though. I really do like the fact that the origion stages are here to play they could of easily said welp origion stages will cost 10 to 15$ paid dlc  to reply those stages but they didnt it seems like ubi this time around made the game  for the consumer not just to make money. Thumbs up to Rayman Legends!!!	2015-08-11

If I could have improved one thing, it would be the judgement ring. On the original Shadow Hearts, and Shadow Hearts: Covenant, they had it set up so that you could improve all your characters judgement rings. In this Shadow Hearts, for some reason, they took that ability away. That means that the judgement ring is considerably harder than the previous 2 games, especially during normal attacks. Also, it makes it somewhat harder to get ring'perfects', and that affects the score. Personally, I like to get a high score, however, if that's not your thing, then it shouldn't matter to you.	2015-08-11

The functionality of the software is horrible also to me as a adult.  After sitting thru the &#34;put on the strap&#34; video it would never give me credit for that to move on.  Also, no way to return and I also bought another cable as I read they are fragile, so now I am stuff with $100 worth of junk.

Don't listen to all the naysayers if you are debating this controller, it's the best one I have used for xbox360. I wish I had bought it before wasting money on a few others. The only fault I can see is that those who aren't careful may mess up the connector or stupidly plug the USB to power before plugging it into the controller which is probably what those with failures did.	2015-08-11

EA took last year off to rebuild their golf game. They should have taken at least one more. This game is just not fun and the putting is terrible.<br /><br />To start with, this is as about bare bones as a golf game could be. Check out some of the more in-depth reviews if you want a full break down on what this game does (and does not) have. But just for examples sake, during create a mode, I was in and had my character created in about 45 seconds. This process in slimmed down create a character modes in other games still usually takes me a good 5 to 10 minutes. There was just nothing to do here. They would have been better off just giving you a generic character to play. The simplicity and lack of options just demonstrates how poor the game is.<br /><br />The play styles are the only highlight of the game. They offer a classic 3-click mode, a pro mode that tracks your swing motion on the thumb stick, and a arcade mode that lets you flick away on the thumb stick with a generous margin for error. Just about any player with any skill level can pick the game up and play.<br /><br />I had heard that the game was beautiful and there were no load times between holes. This isn't quite true. The game does not have any loading specific screens, but the leader board was shown in between each hole during my play through, and there was a delay in between when I could advance to the next hole. I have to imagine while these are not technically labeled load screens, there is some loading going on in the background. As far as being beautiful... well, not so much. Much of the color looked washed out. There was a hilarious amount of &#34;popping&#34; as elements suddenly appeared on screen that were not there before. During the opening intro cinematic, the camera pans across a field of grass and random flowers just start popping into the picture in the middle of the grass. All things considered, there is not the leap I would expect between the graphics on the last EA golf game and this, the first one on next gen hardware.<br /><br />Unless you are desperate for a golf game on console, I would stay away. Or go pick up Mario Golf on the DS, at least the putting works there. Give EA another year to refine the game and flesh it out more. There are things that may be good about this game, they are just hard to focus or even recognize with so much missing from it. Maybe EA can flip that come next year's game.	2015-08-11

All in all i'm pretty happy with these. The colors aren't exactly what I typically would have picked, but I received this product at a lower cost in exchange for an honest review, so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />I recently bought a refurbed controller from GameStop and it came with this really great rubber grip that I've become quite fond of. These aren't quite as comfortable as those, hence the star deduction. I'm not a huge fan of the little nubs that sit at the top of the grip, but I know they serve the purpose of providing a nice anti-slip for your thumbs. I just don't really like the way they feel. I'm sure I'll get used to it fairly quickly so it's a not a huge con.<br /><br />I haven't had these long enough to see just how durable they are but will update if I notice something that needs mentioning.	2015-08-11

At first i loved it, with Kodi, I could watch movies, Tv, listen to music, etc all from my magic little box- what's not to love? It runs emulators, and is also capable of casting or plugging into a television to use as a traditional console.<br /><br />All of the things shield was advertised as, I assure you, are true.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there are a number of COMMON mechanical issues that signal a death knell for your shield. The touch screen is  guaranteed to fail eventually, as was the case with my unit. This renders many of the apps supported by the unit (including certain emulators) useless. Furthermore, replacements for the screen are unavailable and near impossible to install (if you are lucky or wealthy enough to find one).  The mini HDMI port on my shield was broken before I received it, and unfortunately I did not attempt to use it until my console was at it's end of life.<br /><br />While the shield, is a mechanical marvel, and a magnificent entertainment device while it lasts, I'm sorry to say that it's durability (in lieu of available replacement parts) is significantly lacking. These mechanical issues are common, please do your own research surfing the forums before purchasing a console.	2015-08-11

The game is rhythm game that involves Vocaloid songs if you didn't know, and this game improves all that the original project diva f had to offer. The resolution on the vita has been cleared up and the game no longer looks blurry. The song selection is also quite varied with additional songs available as dlc. Old data from the other game can be transfered over so you can still use the old costumes from the other game!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is segas decision to divide the edit song (custom song) database. Apparently now the japanese edit songs are impossible to play now on the North America versions of the game due to the addition of more characters being available to write into songs to accommodate english words. That means we miss out on all the creative videos that other people have created around the world! I would have rather had them not make this change p I probably would have imported the game instead if I knew about it because edit songs can really make this game more interesting. It's still fun if you don't care about that though. The base game is still addicting.<br /><br />Miku's return has been awesome and I highly recommend this as a rhythm game fan despite its lackluster edit songs.	2015-08-11

(Sadly, it feels rushed.) The gameplay is fun, and I would say it feels different than &#34;SSB's&#34;. I have played it for months. My favorite characters are Dante, Evil Cole, Jak, and Sly. I ended up mastering the first (3) with practice. The gameplay was made, to have players create their own combos. (I'm serious!) I would recommend this, instead of the suggested combos, from the character tutorials. Characters could roll, and block. Some of the roster has characters, that could parry, or Sly, who turns invisible, instead of blocking. There are also cheap grab moves! The game itself, focuses of one-shot KO's. All players need to build their &#34;Super&#34; meter, and use it for a cool KO move. Supers are separated into (3) levels. All are best for certain situations. Players must build &#34;AP&#34; by attacking their opponents, so they could use a super. I would go and say, all characters have CHEAP abilities. That's just how it is. It might be frustrating at times, but its a game that will be fun, if you practice. Learn even by watching your teammates, or opponents. The stages are from many other (PlayStation) games. I find it a bit strange. This is how a stage works. You're in one place and all of a sudden, there are hazards, and the backgrounds change. It's another game setting intersecting the one in place. One of my favorites, is &#34;Alden's Tower&#34; from inFAMOUS, which goes to Sly's rooftops. (Clearly, its a Sucker Punch reference.) It's a strange, but fun feature. (Hey, even Patapon made it...) All of the backgrounds are animated well.<br /><br />There are 4 DLC characters, which are fine. I loved them, despite a couple feeling odd. If you of course purchase the PS3 version, you will get the digital VITA version for free! This is a great deal that can't be ignored, unless you don't own a PS3. One of the coolest features is the cross-play. PS3 and VITA players, could play matches with each other! So, grab your friends, and have some fun!<br /><br />Replay value: There's an arcade mode with a story, and each character rivals another. You have tons of multiplayer hours here. (I actually felt bored from the arcade mode. It's too easy, and slow.) I don't recommend this game, unless you love these characters, but also expect to spend lots of time in multiplayer. (That's local, or online! Yes, bots are included!) Aside from the gameplay, there are a great set of trophies here.fun!

Where I was disappointed was the combat. Every time I would hit a target I would take far more damage than I dealt. The monsters counterattack really fast. It just was not as fun as it could have been. Also, archers hurt me more than bosses. The levels are ok, first you fight undead, and they were cool. After that - plants? Not so much fun.<br /><br />I usually give games like this at least a 4 star since many other reviews are less and I think more games are better. However, I could not finish Bound by Fire - rare for me, since I love fantasy RPGs and usually finish my games. Oh well.	2015-08-11

These easily downloaded in to my computer, everything was packaged in a nice manner and safely, and so far I haven't had any glitches with the game.
