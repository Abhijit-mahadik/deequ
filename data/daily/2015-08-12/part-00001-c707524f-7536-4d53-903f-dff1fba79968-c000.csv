A little stiff at first but broke in nicely with about 15 miles of walking and daily wear. I have not been using the top pair of eyelets for most of my walking. The laces are short for using all eyelets and as a new shoe it was a bit stiff with all the eyelets threaded. Has a good, wide sole for hiking over uneven terrain. Fit is just as expected once it broke in - I'm usually an 11.5 D and this is what I ordered. Had a pair of these years ago and they were very long lasting. I'm large, 6'2&#34; and 260, so I like sturdy shoes.	2015-08-12

I was putting them on and the rivet on the back, holding together the strap and the piece behind the heel, came out. I was traveling and couldn't easily buy new shoes so I ended up wearing dress shoes with a casual outfit that day. I was able to fix it using a pair of tweezers after an hour of working on it, but I was disappointed in the construction. There are buckles that should be used, but they don't slide well and are difficult to use, so I was trying to quickly put them on without undoing the buckle. Still, I wasn't expecting these to break on one of my first wearings.	2015-08-12

They are made of soft and luxurious leather. I do not have any issues with the tongue as others have noted. It lays normally and does not fold over.  I wear a size 8.5-9 and the 8.5 fit perfect with room for thick socks. They're very comfortable and are not too narrow or too wide. They have great support as well. I have high arches and these will be easy to wear for long periods. Also, they are sturdy so it will be no problem walking in the snow or on ice. I like how you can adjust the length of the leather straps too so you can switch up your look depending on what style you're going for! They do have a slight chemical-leather scent but it will go away now that they're out of the packaging. I can't wait to wear them this fall/winter ! Amazon also had the best price out there for these in black, thanks Amazon!!!	2015-08-12

I could not stop laughing whenever I saw this. I actually just ordered a pair of wedges, and after I went to the check out, this came up as a suggested purchase.

After 6 to 9 months, the uppers are stretched and don't provide the snug fit I prefer, so I get another pair.  I feel the price is reasonable and find the selection of colors a nice feature.

These are simple to install (2 seconds) and they really help with biking.  When going on longer trails from sunlight to shade, these really brighten the shade while taking edge off glare.  Also feels really comfortable for the eyes in slightly cloudy to rainy conditions.  I like them while driving a car too. Only time I need something darker is when it is really bright and no shade in sight (like mid day, full sun).  I clipped these on my prescription plastic glasses that also have darkening capability and are small sized enough to prevent fogging up.  My glasses are never quite dark enough.  This yellow clip on keeps my regular glasses more light grey, rather than darkening completely, which is actually great in most conditions.  When I go into the shade normally, my regular glasses stay dark for awhile, whereas with these clip ons I don't feel like I'm going into a tunnel.  I like that I can flip the shades up briefly to get more light.  Best of both worlds.  I also bought a different brand darker pair of flip shades which I like too, but finding I am using the yellow ones more.  Also like that they are inexpensive, so if they get lost, broken or stolen I don't feel too much of a loss.  I'll just get another one!	2015-08-12

I took a chance and I chose a pair that have a similar cut to sunglasses I use almost every day.  These glasses are very nice to look through.  The view is quite clear.  They are definitely polarized.  The amount of tint is just right, i.e., dark enough to wear in the sun but not too dark to wear in a building.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I like the skinny ear pieces because I like to have all the peripheral vision I can get, and some of the wider ear pieces block my vision.  These glasses are very nice for the money.  I think they are perfect for my vacation.  I have had these new glasses for a couple of weeks at the time of this writing.	2015-08-12

These shoes are very comfortable, and they need little to no break-in-time and they breathe well. I bought them as work shoes because of the light materials and mesh vent. I'm glad I did.

The purpose of buying a EEEE width shoe is to accommodate a WIDE foot, which is usually widest at the forward part of the foot.  The toe box on these shoes is entirely too narrow to fit comfortably on a EEEE width foot and the arch support is poor. I have worn them, so I guess that I'm stuck with them, but I wouldn't buy them again. I have removed the inner soles and replaced them with orthotics that provide much better arch support, but that doesn't compensate for the uncomfortably narrow toe box. I've always liked New Balance shoes, but they need to go back to the 966 style toe box on their wide shoes.	2015-08-12

I have sandals that are over $100 that I can barely wear for an hour without something hurting or rubbing. When these arrived I was afraid of the toe strap possibly rubbing on my big or little toes. I took a chance and threw them on the next morning and wore them all day - SUPER COMFORTABLE! The sole is flexible and footbed is padded just enough, my feet never felt &#34;tired&#34;. No blisters, no weird marks, no rubbing. And the quality is superb for the price!!! All the stitching is perfect and construction is just right. To help anyone out I'm a size 11 with a narrow/medium width foot and relatively bony feet (not like creepily bony;) and ankles. I was afraid the elastic may be too loose as many companies seem to assume that if you're a size 11 you have fat wide feet! If you do, the straps are a soft elastic with the perfect amount of stretch! The toe strap is reinforced to keep your toes in, I could literally run in these babies. Ordering more colors!!! Oh and my feet didn't get sweaty (not like I have sweaty feet either but some faux leather materials have made the bottoms of my feet sweat = dangerous!).	2015-08-12

I am amazed at the large toe box. Don't listen to salesmen. I was advised not to buy this shoe because the toe box was not as large as the Altra. Wrong. It is not quite as comfy as the Altra or nearly as comfy as the Vivobarefoot 200010, but if you need a shoe with more than a zero drop, these fit the bill. I ordered a half size up but may go a full size up. I gave this shoe a 4 rather than a 5 because the top of the ankle area, all the way around, is a bit uncomfortable. However, a little breaking in may be necessary.  Lastly, I was advised the lugs on the bottom of Newton shoes would take an adjustment. Wrong again. With this particular shoe I felt no difference when walking around.	2015-08-12

They arrived with one lens popped out which gave me a bad feeling but I popped it back in and haven't had an issue since.  The polarization isn't strong but its sufficient.  They are classic frame aviators.  I bought the gold frames, note that the ear/tail pieces on the gold frame are clear, which I think is kind of a cool/distinctive look.

When I tried the 7.5 the length was perfect but they were very narrow in the ball/toe. Determined not to get burned keeping a pair of too small sandals I covered the bottoms with removable shelf paper to protect them from wear.

I bought these sunglasses at the suggestion of Amazon. I guess they know that I've purchased a lot of Daft Punk CDs and DVDs and I might like them. Well, I do like them, very much. The fit is perfect. Nice and snug and just right for my large head (7 7/8). I love the look.  They seem quite sturdy. I have the black color frames and my lenses are quite dark. Vision through the lenses is good and these really work well in the intense Southern California sun. Ordinarily, I wear prescription lenses, and, of course, I can't get the precise vision with these. If I could get  these in my prescription, I'd buy them in an instant. A fine pair of sunglasses!	2015-08-12

Have not worn them out of the house yet, but the arch support seems good. Also seems like they will stay put on your feet nicely. I noticed other reviews stating how narrow they are - and I agree. the strap over the toe area is tighter than expected but I am still able to wear them fine (note my feet are typically medium width). Good grip on the bottom, and the inner sole is made of some soft synthetic material which I hope will be more comfortable than the rubber type soles of some shoes in this style.	2015-08-12

The size was perfect, comfortable right out of the box, gold color pretty and the leather is dyed instead of coated, but.....the upper portion (tongue) is cut too low giving the shoe a frumpy look instead of the Palm Beach cool vibe. If Aerosoles made the tongue longer over the top of the foot these would've been very hip. I ended up with the Massimo Matteo drivers instead and they're exactly the look I was going for. My mom would've kept the Aerosoles if they hadn't been gold, she loved the style...she's 84.	2015-08-12

Will tip over when left to stand unattended without proper placement.  Since my last review, I purchased adhesive bumpers at the hardware store to attach to the two legs of the Leg Stand to raise the height on one side. A strip of black electrical tape wrap reinforces each connection. Now I can set the tote  down anywhere without thinking about it. The retractable handle does not lock open, so when you release it,it retracts. I am happy to report that I am really satisfied with my purchase.	2015-08-12

I have a bit of a wide foot and some of the trendy-brand boat shoes are too tight across the toes for me.  These did run a bit large, however.  I always wear a 7.5 but these were very roomy;  I could probably have gotten the 7s'.  However, I inserted a memory foam insole and that made them fit perfectly.  The insole they come with is glued down but not very firmly so I just removed it, put the memory foam insole in, and replaced the original insole on top.  Very pillowy and comfortable.  They would also work if you needed to replace the insole with an orthotic.	2015-08-12

I was recommended to this brand by a friend, and took a chance ordering them online.  I wore them immediately after getting them, on vacation and was on my feet for over 12 hours walking. They saved my feet! I also replaced my orthodics after vacation with the walkfit also offered on Amazon. Both together are awsome!

I don't wear it casually like other people. If I wanted to wear casual running shoes they would be roshie runs. But I digress.<br /><br />The heels have good support for those that land on heels. Although if you run flat footed (which I tried one day) you will definitely feel the pain of your soles after about 4 miles.

I would also feel concerned about the strength of the bags when buying a 6 pack of beer, so I searched on The Sweet Home, and this bag was one that was recommended. I went ahead and bought it, and when it arrived I was happy that the color of the bag was as it appeared on my screen, and the bag was bigger than I imagined it would be.<br /><br />I've had many trips to the grocery store within walking distance, and a few to Aldi as well, and every time I use this bag it's such a pleasure. It seriously holds so much stuff and the material is very high quality, I don't worry that any boxes or plastic containers will puncture/tear/rip the bag, however it's not so bulky that I can't sloppily fold it and put it in it's little pouch without struggling to make it fit. The straps are also thick, so if you put it over your shoulder, they don't painfully dig into your arm when the bag is as full as it can get.	2015-08-12

I received two pair (different styles) from a China address and when I opened them, the stench was overwhelming! I tried them on, for what reason I do not know, and walked in them.  The soles were very slippery and although I ordered 1 size larger per the reviews they were tight.  This was secondary of course to the smell.  I wrote the seller who told me that they needed to be left in &#34;a ventilated area&#34; because the leather was new.  Isn't that what you normally do with leather shoes, leave them for a certain period of time in a ventilated area until the stench goes away?  How ridiculous!  I saw a review that stated they had to be returned to China and it wasn't worth the return postage fee.  I knew I couldn't donate the shoes because of the smell, it wouldn't be right, so I threw them out.  Buyer Beware!	2015-08-12

I've had a pair of Keen H2 Sandals for 6-7 years and love them.  They finally gave up the ghost and so I needed a new pair.  My old sandals were a size 9.5 so i decided to order a 9.5 again.  WRONG, these were to small and had to exchange them for a size 10.  These fit almost perfectly.  they still felt a bit snug in the width and  the length was about right but my 9.5s still seemed a bit longer.  However, the more I wear them the more cofortable they become in the width and length so I'm guessing they are stretching out that little bit.<br /><br />For those wanting these sandals for boating,  I sail a lot and race.  I wear my sandals for cruising, they work great since your toes are protected and provide enough grip for what I need when cruising.  As for racing I where regular sailing shoes that are made to grip.  If I was only in hte cockpit then I might wear my sandals but I tend to wear my racing shoes.<br /><br />Heat build up -- If I walk around on warm pavement my feet do tend to get hot in these sandals.  This happened with my old sandal and is the reason I gave them 4 stars.  That said, they don't get hot enough where they are uncomfortable but they will get a little warm.  THis is one thing that I did not expect.<br /><br />Overall these are great shoes and the only sandal I own.  They are comfortable (even if a little warm) but they meet all my needs.	2015-08-12

I specifically went looking for Harley boots last year (2014 -- yes I'm a little late on my review), because my 1st pair were comfy and lasted me for so many years.  My only complaint is your feet can get extremely cold if you don't wear the appropriate socks.  I live in MA and we had a brutal winter last year between the cold and the snow,  but as long as I had nice thick socks on my feet stayed warm and dry.  I recommend these boots to anyone looking to make an investment because you won't be needing another pair as long as you use leather protector / waterproofing spray and only wear them in the winter for the same purpose as myself.  If you live somewhere like MA that is . . . as far as wearing them all year long I would guess they stay in great shape for a few years too.<br /><br />These particular boots zip on the side making it easy putting them on and taking them off which is why I tried this style versus the same I had as before + they're a bit taller.  I hope this helps someone making a decision . . . Harley Davidson makes quality products!!!	2015-08-12

Bought these for my daughters (ages 3 and 5) as they are flower girls in my sister's wedding.  They are adorable and my girls love them.  The heel is higher than I expected or than the picture seems to portray, and I was worried about my 3 year old twisting her ankle; however, they have both been wearing the shoes around the house with no twists or sprains occurring :)  There isn't a whole lot of traction on the bottom of the shoes (especially the heel) so I think I will scrape them up a bit before the wedding day.  The &#34;jewels&#34; may rub off easily if the shoes are rubbed together but they came with a little baggie of extra jewels and an extra heel insert.  I haven't had to use either, but I guess it's good that they were included.  I think they are cute little shoes and are good quality for the price.  They will be perfect for the wedding!	2015-08-12

It's a  beautiful structured bag that won't loose it's shape over time. It's made of coated leather that prevent the bag from scratches, really easy to clean (wipeable). Its a medium size aprox 10.5 wide 9.5 height, but fits a lot.  I have taken pictures of how much the bag fits, There's a large size wallet (8 inch) large make up bag (7 inch) Olay proX (6 inch) baby cup, and many other items.  Incredibly there was more space left to fit even more. This is the outlet version, Color is not white but beige and black.  The only con is that it doesn't have bottom feet.  I definitely recommend this purchase, you just can't go wrong with this satchel.	2015-08-12

I really like these sunglasses! They are not too big on my small face and they feel pretty high quality for the price. Only 4/5 stars because the mirrored lenses are a little too dark for me and I can see reflections on the inside of the lenses that are distracting. I wore them kayaking on the lake in full sun and the polarization worked pretty well but I wouldn't wear them to driving or on a cloudy day. Overall very satisfied, I plan on buying another pair without the mirrored lenses to wear day to day and to drive in. I didn't know when I bout them but mine came with a great little carrying pouch and an neck strap that came in handy kayaking. Awesome bonus!	2015-08-12

They are light weight and very durable and I've got two boys.  The soles are like normal shoes, not to thin.  They can get them on and off, no tieing, just put them on and go, very convenient.  If you go to parks with little rocks around the equipment they might complain a little if they aren't used to it.  My kids don't care unless they get a lot of rocks in there, but you see the same thing with a closed in shoe.  And again they just take them off, get the rock out, put them back on and off they go.  When you take this shoe off versus a closed shoe there's always rocks in there.  Most of all the kids love them and most of time they like putting them on by themselves.  Most recommended for summer activities.	2015-08-12

These are just the worst. I bought them for my husband to wear at work. They are so uncomfortable and poorly made that he doesn't even want to wear them when he's just sitting at a desk.

After reading the previous reviews  I ordered them half a size bigger. I'm glad I did because they fit just right, but if I wanted to wear<br />thick socks or two pairs of socks, as I sometimes do when hiking, they would be too small. I also bought them because there<br />were good comments about the quality, but after wearing them just two days in the city to brake them in I discovered there is a small<br />separation between the layers of the souls, so they will probably come apart sooner than I anticipated. This has been a problem with<br />other Hi-Tec boots I have worn and I don´t think the quality is so great. They look really good and they seem a lot sturdier than my<br />previous Hi-Tec boots, but still I was hoping these would be much better after all the comments on good quality. The bottom line here<br />is that is better to spend more and get a really good quality boot that will stand abuse in the mountain. My favorites are Lowa, they<br />cost a lot more but worth it.	2015-08-12

Hold it out of the way before you place the strap on your shoulder.	2015-08-12

The best I have managed is to get it so I am not always in bad pain (tried it all, custom insoles, braces, steroid shots, PT, etc.) . Walking in the wrong shoes is just about the worst thing I can do to aggravate things. I knew I was spending two months overseas and that I would be walking a lot. For an extremely shallow reason (I saw some dude wearing ECO golf shoes on the street), I decided to buy these. At $160, I thought I was a fool, but I did it anyway.<br /><br />Well, I have been wearing these things all day for three months now. I walked 5-10 miles a day in 95F weather. Streets, hiking, everything. I won't claim that they cured my foot problem, but they did not make it worse. In fact, I felt less foot fatigue after the long periods of time on my feet. They have great traction, are study and free of defects aside from some staining. The manufacturing quality is impressive. Looking at the tread and outsides, and the insoles all seem like new (again, aside from some stains).<br /><br />I had never even heard of ECOs before buying these. I lucked out.	2015-08-12

In most sheepskin/ shearling shoes and slippers, I buy a 7 because they stretch. So, I bought these in a 7 and they were just too tight. There seemed to be no give in them.<br /><br />I  sent them back to Amazon and am awaiting my size 8s. I am assuming they should fit perfectly.<br /><br />Quality seemed good. The bottom can completely come out, which means you can buy Ugg inserts and put them in and you have new slippers! (My other sheepskin ones (Bearpaw Loki 2) didn't have removable inserts and I wore them until the shearling was gone. I looked at the Ugg ones and would have bought those, but the bottom insoles didn't come out of those either.<br /><br />Only thing I didn't like was that I paid, $53 for the lime green size 7s. 2 days later, I had to pay $69 for any of the size 8s. I wish Amazon would let you exchange items and get the same price.<br /><br />I took 1 star off, just because I do not know the longevity of the slippers yet. I will update after a few months to let you know!	2015-08-12

After reading various reviews of these sandals, I wasn't sure what size to order because a lot of people were saying that they ran small. I usually wear a 7 or 7.5, but for some reason I just KNEW that an 8 would not work for me, so I went ahead and ordered the 7.5 and they fit perfectly! Not only that, but they were both BEAUTIFUL AND COMFORTABLE! Such a rare and great combination. I also love the coloring in person even more than the pictures. (I got the grey with the teal/turquoise floral pattern pair) So if you're considering these, to me they're well worth the money, because they weren't expensive, but they have the look and feel of some of my most costly shoes/boots/sandals, etc. I LOVE these sandals, and part of the proof of what I'm saying is that I almost never write reviews, even when I do in fact like/dislike a purchase. (LOL) So as I said, if you're considering them, in whatever color you like, I believe you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't! =)	2015-08-12

Luckily my daughter's sandals have held up quite well. She's not gentle with her shoes either -- wore them quite a bit on vacation and found them very comfortable.

Filson uses an &#34;old fashion&#34; type of insulation of wool and leather. That is, wool is &#34;sandwiched&#34; between the outside leather and an inner leather lining. The outside leather is thick but very supple and the leather lining provides significant comfort. Contrary to my review of the waterproof uplander boot which I found to be extremely narrow in width, the highlanders fit as expected. I normally wear a size 10 M in an unlined boot and a 10.5 M in a lined boot such as the highlanders and the 10.5 fit perfectly. I think the leather lining will prove to provide comfort not only for a couple of hours but for an entire day. As with all of Filson products, the highlander is expensive but is worth every penny.	2015-08-12

However, the sole itself is surprisingly hard, and I was unable to wear these comfortably for more than an hour or so due to the hardness of the sole.

I ordered these for my 93-year-old mom who needed some safe and cozy slippers she could get into and out of easily and move around in safely (rubber-soled). There's just enough grip on these to make them non-skid, and not so much that they cause stumbling. They're not particularly pretty -- they make her feet look huge! But the color is pretty, and the fabric is yummy comfy. She's extremely happy. As I noted, these don't provide good arch support, but they were bought for comfort and safety in walking short distances around the home, not for going on a long hike! I would buy again for her, and maybe even for me! My mom wears an 8.5M and I wear a 9M. This M fits both of us.	2015-08-12

I love, love, love gladiator shoes in pewter, and these fit the bill! It's true that they're a little longer than normal when I'm sitting, but when I stand up, my foot expands (I have a high arch, though, and a shoe saleswoman pointed out to me once that hight arches DO expand a lot in length when standing) to fill that empty space. I have had strangers compliment me on my cute shoes, and ask what brand they are. They aren't 100% comfortable (let's say, they're 90% comfortable), but I have not developed any blisters wearing them in the past few months I've been wearing them, so, as far as I'm concerned, they're pretty good, and will probably become even more comfortable over time. Two things that are essential when I'm trying on sandals (or shoes in general), are comfort, cushion, and traction on the bottom, as, I don't know about you, but I HATE slip-sliding around due to slick shoe bottoms. In these sandals, both the cushion and the traction are good!	2015-08-12

The photo showing it worn to the back - forget it.  This is comfortable and holds a lot of stuff.  My only complaint is that over time the straps slide down, requiring periodic adjustments in length.  The back inside pocket is almost large enough to hold 8.5 x 11 papers.

The strap on the top is a little tight as others have mentioned but these stretch just a little bit so they are perfect and have never been too tight to leave a mark on her foot. She would never wear these if they were not comfortable. My daughter has a pretty wide foot and these do not rub or cause blisters for her. The glitter is still holding strong also.	2015-08-12

Looking at the shoe I can see the heel construction is not the same as in my previous Asics I think there is  less gel and less support so I am disappointed as these shoes were pricey- I am going to keep them for bike riding but plan to buy another pair an older model that has all that extra support for my foot-My old ASICS are too old and worn to keep  I had higher expectations all related to several previous purchases of the same brand running shoe	2015-08-12

But another 6 or 7 pairs never shipped as they were already out of stock when I ordered them.  That leaves me with a half dozen or so all told and none of them has a single scratch on the lens.

I am very impressed with the Bloch Dance Dansoft Ballet Slipper!  I can tell it is fabricated with excellent quality.  Most importantly, my daughter loves them!  I was a little worried about ordering ballet shoes online, but after reading the reviews I was comfortable with what size I should order my daughter.  She is only 3 and wears a size 9 in shoes.  When we tried on the ballet slippers at Payless I had her in a 10 and it was too wide (plus the quality was not very good).  After reading the reviews I ordered a half size bigger, so I got her a 9.5 M (what I received was a 9.5 D, the reviews have very helpful hints for what size to order).  When I took the ballet slippers out I was worried they weren't going to fit her.  They looked small, but they actually fit perfect with a little bit of room in the toes!  I am so glad I ordered a half size bigger instead of a full size!  The ties on the front can be pulled to make sure the slipper fits her foot perfect.  She didn't want to take her shoes off she was so excited!  So, I was able to get a better quality ballet slipper for a lower cost than Payless!  Overall, I would highly recommend these ballet slippers!!!!<br /><br />Pictured below: I hadn't tightened the strings of the bow yet, my daughter was too excited to have them on!	2015-08-12

I 've had two pairs of Timberland boots.  Each pair lasted about a year and  then eas  completely worn out.  The soles delaminated within 10 months and had to be siliconed back together.  These Hi-Ted feel and look to be very well made.  I am hoping that I can get several years of use out of these boots.  They were comfortable from the first day they arrived.  I worn them all day.  I really like the eyelets and the speed eyelets.  Very sturdy and well made.  The Timberland eyelets were sharp on the edges and eventually cut through the laces, which were not a good quality anyway.  The Hi-Tec laces are a very heavy duty rolled lace.  Very nice all the way around. Thanks for a good and well made product.  Stan	2015-08-12

I expected the shoes to be too small.  See, I asked a question about sizing.  I felt in my gut that I should buy a half size down.  I'm normally a nine, and even though Amazon advised against it, I bought an 8.5.  Gut feeling paid off!!<br /><br />These shoes are PERFECT.  Super comfortable and fit just right.  Also, there's an adjustable zipper if I want to widen the calf.  Perfect!  Might buy a few more pairs.<br /><br />ORDER HALF A SIZE DOWN.	2015-08-12

I found this pair and absolutely loved how bright and colorful they are. These fit somewhat small. The main thing that really bothers me about the size is that fit tight across the top. Another thing that really bothers me about this product is that I only had them a couple weeks before they started peeling. Its like the colors are on a thin paper and just placed over white shoes. So now I have medium size white spots where it should be colored. I probably won't buy another pair of sanitas for that reason. My danskos lasted 2.5 years before they even got scuffed on the toe.	2015-08-12

She's had them for 8 months and no major damage UPDATE- these shoes awe nothing like the leopard ones she has, like another reviewer said the glitter falls off and with in a week of having them and only wearing twice there were obvious spots where glitter had fallen off, the shoe has also detached from the sole in the front of one shoe. So angry that these shoes are such poor quality, my daughter was so excited to have them and could only wear them a handful of times.

This is the 2nd year I have bought these for my 10 year-old's dance class.  She only uses them 2 hours a week though, so I'm not sure how well they would perform for a &#34;true&#34; ballerina. (My daughter is on a competitive Acro team, but has to take 1 hour of ballet and 1 hour of Leap & Turns, to accompany the Acro team.) If you daughter does nothing but more ballet style classes, you might want to invest in better shoes.<br /><br />She is currently wearing a woman's size 5 and the SIZE 6 WOMENS in these fit perfect, with a bit of growing room. I bought the same shoes last year and she had to go up a size as well.<br /><br />It is nice that when they get stinky, I wash them in cold and line dry them. They don't come out clean looking, as they are very pale pink canvas, but they do smell better!	2015-08-12

I have been looking for a new pair of polarized sunglasses for the longest time. I am glad to have come across Coleman's Polarized sunglasses which feature an oversized frame with beautiful accents. It fits perfectly on my face (I am square faced), stylish, frames are lightweight, durable and since I like wearing it on top of my head at times, I am glad that it won't stretch out if done that way. The lenses are polarized to eliminate glare and block 100%UV (ABC).<br /><br />It came with a black drawstring bag to protect it while it's inside your purse. One thing missing is the microfiber cloth for cleaning, but I have lots of that at home so it's perfectly fine. I have sensitivity to light (major migraine trigger) and this is the perfect sunglasses for me! I am extremely pleased with this purchase! If you're out and about, I highly recommend you get one for yourself!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-12

It matches the color well but When I opened it I noticed that the soles of the shoes already had crack marks in it. Which honestly I hope does not lead to the shoe breaking. Also, I have very narrow feet and these shoes are very tight on the sides for me so be careful and order a size up. With knowing its tight on the sides I know I can't get to crazy running around in these shoes.	2015-08-12

I really wanted to give these beautiful shoes 5 stars! They are exactly as lovely as the pictures show. However, I bought a size bigger than my normal size (I'm a UK 7) and they are extremely tight. With heels this high and no internal bridge support, tight shoes basically make you walk on the ball of your foot. Painful and unhealthy, and so unnecessary, if shoemakers make shoes according to shoe sizes. I am curious to know who the manufacturers are who are rewriting shoe sizes like this? I am not returning (shipping will just make me lose more than I paid) but will regift. By all means buy them, but go more than a size up!	2015-08-12

I have had this shoe for 6 months now, and I hope I can keep finding it on Amazon, because it's a great shoe for minimalist running, and for those who realize a narrow toe box is restrictive and stupid. In any case, I will put Altra on my radar, to find other shoes they make that might work for me. Read the other reviews and recognize that it's not for everyone, but I would say it's certainly for minimalist runners.	2015-08-12

Also, they have a much better sizing chart on their website, I would check that out before purchasing.<br /><br />I'll follow up with an actual review after my hike in October.  4 stars because I'm feeling hopeful that I will love these.	2015-08-12

I was able to wear them immediately without any discomfort.  These shoes, however, run narrower and the color is different.  I was going to exchange for a wide width, but they didn't have them.  I'm still deciding whether these will stretch out after I wear them, or if I need to return.  I've worn on the carpet at home, but they don't get better.  I do like the looks of the shoe and searched everywhere to find them at a comparable price from last year when I paid $55.00 at the discounter store.  I believe this style has been discontinued.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the fit, but otherwise they are okay.	2015-08-12

Before purchasing these, I read reviews about size and fit on other styles. I've been wearing boots since I could walk, and some brands fit larger or smaller than others. I just want to say to everyone to ignore all the comments and reviews from city dwellers who seem to give a bad review on a boot because they don't know how it's supposed to look and feel. Under no circumstances is a boot supposed to feel comfortable. I'm originally from the mid west so I know. Boots are for work, not city girl fashion, but if you must wear it, keep in mind that it is a feeling one must get used to.<br />I love the Ariat brand and they do run a little big. You also must keep in mind the style of toe you order. The more pointed the toe, the bigger you might want to get for some wiggle room on the toes. I've only worn this pair a few days and yes they are tight slipping on, but once on there is plenty of room. I wear a size 6 women's, and I ordered a 5.5. There is still a little room but anything smaller would miss my arch. They rub against the top of my foot, but they're made so they don't fall off when riding. They will loosen up as you wear them. Not wearing to the club, I mean walking in them around a rough yard, thats when you'll feel the break in. Wear them as much as you can to break them in. This style seems to be so that jeans can be tucked in to them, that's why there is a wider calf. If you want that city girl look where they hug your calves while wearing shorts or dresses,  try getting a child size and that should do the trick. These also look good with jeans pulled over. The design matches with nearly everything, and I got lots of compliments on them.	2015-08-12

The soles are falling apart. The front of the shoe is falling apart. I have to keep cutting off the tread on the sole because it is pulling apart from the shoe. The &#34;slip resistant&#34; part is horrible. What happened was that when walking in snow, the snow would get packed up into the tread forming dense, almost like a ball, layer of snow. This made it so it not only was NOT slip resistant, but actually more slippery. I hate these shoes. Do not buy if you live where you will be walking through snow. Also, do not expect them to last for more than a year.	2015-08-12

I went by the other reviews and ordered my exact size, 7-1/2, but sadly they were too small.  I sent them back for a refund.  (Thank you Amazon for your prompt action on my return).  I ordered the next size up, 8, and they arrived yesterday.  Just right.  So I'm a bit confused by all of the comments that say they run large.  This was not the case for me.  But whatever Amazon made the exchange oh so easy!<br /><br />Very comfortable, light weight and oh so cute!!  Can't wait to wear them on my next trip.  Will update my review when I have worn them more.<br /><br />Update: 8/27/15 - Love these even more than when I received them.  Feel very comfortable even with wearing them for hours.  And I've received  many complements on how cute and sexy they are.  Next year plan to buy a black pair.  If I lived in a warmer climate I believe that I would live in these shoes. Will update after vacation.	2015-08-12

They're Keds, so don't expect arch support--which I like because I have flat feet, I prefer to us custom arch supports because of that.  And they'll take a 10 or 20 wearings to be comfortable all day.<br /><br />But they are Keds: they will last the next 20 years, no problem.  I'm more than willing to break in shoes that will last me that long. :-)<br /><br />One bit of a warning: they are brighter in reality than on screen.  Now, given that Keds can be tossed into the wash, I expect them to fade to that shade of light mint green.  But as they are now, vibrant light green is closer to what you'll get.	2015-08-12

She used to have a pair of brown cowboy boots from a department store that ripped at the toe within the first month of use. So we exchanged them and got another pair, same thing happened.<br /><br />We haven't had these quite a month yet, but there's absolutely no damage to the toe whatsoever and she wears these things every day (on a ranch too).<br /><br />They are adorable and the color is pretty true to the image.	2015-08-12

Either my feet shrank, these fit larger than described or the shoe/boot industry is conspiring to change standards for sizing without telling anyone. I would send these back to get a better fitting pair but I cleaned with them on and got a bunch of interesting substances on them. They held up well and are very comfortable.<br /><br />One minor complaint... I'm 6'0&#34; and the added height these things give me make turning door knobs without having to crouch and not hitting my head on things a bit more difficult.<br /><br />I think these boots are half a size too big and may order a proper fitting pair of regular size 11. Since these are half a size too big, it would be awesome if I could get a discount of half off the original price if I do order another pair.	2015-08-12

I had originally bought them as a &#34;do it all&#34; summer shoe. I wanted something that was comfortable to wear all day and walk in for extended periods, but that also looked good enough to wear with shorts and a nice shirt for a casual night out (something a notch up from standard tennis shoes, with my thought being that something tan/neutral in color would do the job).  They do great for the former, not so much for the latter.<br /><br />First, the good:<br />- Fit me true-to-size<br />- Very durable, good quality<br />- Comfortable to wear for extended periods<br />- Tread not overly-aggressive (as compared to other Merrell hiking shoes<br />- Looks fine with jeans or other casual long pants<br /><br />Where it missed for me:<br />- Quite a &#34;clunky&#34; shoe, befitting some time out on the trail or other &#34;outdoorsy&#34; activity, but would perhaps look a little goofy/clunky/heavy duty for use at the pool, or if trying to dress &#34;dress casual&#34; with shorts and a nice shirt for a night out.<br /><br />And believe me, I am anything but &#34;Mr. Fashion&#34;, and most of us are pretty laid back and casual here in Texas as far as dress goes. But it just wasn't the shoe I was looking for for this purpose.<br /><br />They are actually the shoes I use to mow the yard in now, and they are perfect for this. I would also not hesitate to use them for a light hike (though I have some other hiking shoes I'd likely use instead) or simply for wearing with jeans or other casual long pants around town. They are comfortable. Just look a little goofy with nice shorts/shirt for going out to dinner or whatever.	2015-08-12

I use them for Zumba and other aerobic type exercise.  I like the phantom tape that is used because it is less weighty than traditional leather stripping for support.  I do not have a problem with the tongue being attached to the shoe, I find that they are a lot easier to put on than some other New Balance shoes that I have owned.  The loop in the back also helps with ease of putting the shoe on. The color is nice and the shoe is not too hot.	2015-08-12

These feel like a throw back to the early MJ's or Explorers, which i used to skate in during the late 80's, only the Spartans have that way better, patented DC grip on their cushy yet responsive sole,  that is comfortable to walk around in but also lets you feel the board or pedals or shift pegs right through the sole,  you always know exactly where your feet are in the Spartans and what they are touching during any activity. Maybe a little more padding over the toes, but thick socks will get me there. Love the DC Spartans, and the feelings of nostalgia that drum up my distant youth - Priceless!	2015-08-12

First of all the shipping was faster than expected. Next, the quality of this item is superb. These are loose fit but as my feet normally take a wider size, they fit perfectly. My feet size is 9 and this item (size 9) was a perfect fit. As soon as I put them on I could feel the comfort and as usual with all the Sketchers I have bought there is no breakin period needed.  I liked this item so much that I ordered a second pair so I could switch between the two. I also immediately prepped them with mink oil (as I do with all my boots/shoes I get). Putting on regular shoe wax would eventually darken the stitch seams (which I absolutely love) so hence only using mink oil (and saddlesoap prior to future mink oil if my boots get too dirty). Again, a super comfortable fit both the soles and the rest of the uppers.	2015-08-12

I loved this shoe - the look and the feel (as far as length) was great.  I just wish they came in a wide because the fit was a bit too narrow for me so I had to return them.  Bought a men's pair for my husband and he loves them - says they are some of the most comfortable shoes he has.  I'd hoped this would be my go-to travel shoe since they are lightweight and stylish!  You can't go wrong with the Clark brand.  I've owned many pairs of Clarks over the years and I usually get tired of the shoes before they wear out!  These even came with an extra pair of shoelaces!	2015-08-12

I really REALLY like these shoes. I normally wear a size 8 so that is what I ordered and they fit great. They are extremely comfortable even after putting them on for the first time. I love the multicolored laces and the thin material near the toes is really unique. The only reason I gave these shoes 4 stars is because at that spot by the toes it is already starting to crease after wearing them for less than a day. It's beginning to make two lines where the front lip comes up because of the thin material. It doesn't look the best and I'm hoping it won't get worse as I wear them. Otherwise, can't beat the price.	2015-08-12

Low and behold, despite listening to other reviewers and ordering one size larger than what I normally wear, they were still too small. The width of the shoe is great and the straps are not too tight at all, but the toe area where your big toe is seems to be curved irregularly and is extremely short. Short to the point that a good chunk of my toe just dangles off the edge. I'm torn between sucking it up and wearing shoes that are awkwardly too small this weekend or just returning them and finding a different pair of shoes. I've included a photo of these wedges lined up with a similar pair of wedges in a smaller size. I ordered a size 10 in these and the other pair pictured is a 9. Guess which pair is smaller? Not the 9's.	2015-08-12

I can not say enough good things about these shoes! They were my first pair of Clarks and I was blown away! I've bought a few other pairs since these ones, but they don't compare to the comfort level of these. I can wear them while I'm standing all day and my feet don't hurt at the end of the day. I originally saw them in a department store and tried them on, and decided to check amazon to see if they had them at a better price. And they sure did! The tops of the shoes got rather scuffed up after months of wearing them, but I'm sure it would come of easily with some shoe shine. The only other thing I might say is that socks can look goofy with these shoes. I only wear them with pants so you can't see them. I like ankle socks, and not really the lower ones. I'm sure the lower ones would stay hidden and work wonderful with them.	2015-08-12

Unfortunately, they are EXTREMELY NARROW! I mean, like, seriously narrow. Half-a-foot-width narrow. And, to be clear, the straps are unforgiving, and there is no stretch.<br />Someone with a smaller foot may fare better, if the width has been carried through all of the sizes (i.e., someone with an overall smaller foot will fit the width).<br /><br /> So, if you have extremely narrow feet, these are lovely and will look amazing, you lucky girls. For the rest of us, not so much. ):<br /><br />I gave two stars, not for the quality, but for the fact they are almost comically narrow and absolutely unwearable on my big giant American feet.	2015-08-12

No blisters and my feet feel fresh.  They're a bit cushier than the previous model The Torin, but you can still feel the ground when running (which I prefer.)  I run in Nikes, Brooks, Asics, and Adidas, but my go-to pair is always Altra.  I'm surprised they're not more popular, especially for long distance runners.	2015-08-12

Most sandals have a plastic surface which feels sticky and uncomfortable to the sole of the foot. With these sandals the soles are either leather as advertised or somehow treated with something to make them easy to wear. They feel as if they have been &#34;broken in&#34; from the very beginning. I recommend it highly. Since I just bought them I cannot say how long they will last but for now they are comfortable, fit well and very satisfactory.	2015-08-12

Sleek shoes and good quality - the suede is smooth, but bound to rub on the heels, as suede always does. The heel is as high as it looks, which I find a mark in its favour.<br />I am awesome on high heels (if I do say so myself), but the slight undercut of the toe of this platform made them feel slightly unstable to me. Granted, I walk a lot, but I wouldn't trust these walking much more than 5-10 blocks outside. Walking inside/stairs/etc., you are good to go.<br />The ankle strap is very thin in comparison the the rest of the shoe, which makes for a nice delicate contrast. Note that doing/undoing the buckle might be clumsy - wee little eyelets.	2015-08-12

It is impossible to wear without the inner sole because the glue is sticking to my daughters foot and being 2 yrs old she refuses to wear them (do t blame her at all, I wouldn't wear them either like that) and the same goes for my 3 yr old son who got the same pair in blue size 11. Without the sole which is also a cushion of sorts is uncomfortable on its own without the already sticky inside.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed and will now rethink all of my purchases I make knowing it won't be used right away. Buying anyhing that will not be used immediately will result in not being able to  return the item(s) even when you end up finding out is defective.	2015-08-12

They would be great for wide feet in the medium width.  I went down a half size and it's slightly better but we have not had this issue with any other stride rite maryjanes.

They've seen everything from dry vertical caves to chest high stream caves to expansive mudflats.  They've held up, but I can see some areas that might start to give out.. the mesh panels aren't the best material for caving, and the laces are not durable at all, but the Stealth rubber soles and rand seem durable and really helps with technical climbs.  My only real complaint so far is that they are not snug around the ankles, and a LOT of debris gets in.  I wouldn't use these at all for very sandy places.  Unfortunately, that and mud are where the Canyoneer 3's soles really shine with their sticky and deep lugs compared to the Adidas Hydros.  The Hydros on the other hand, which are getting extremely hard to find, keep debris out with the integrated ankle strap and no mesh panels.  Also, the Canyoneers seemed true to size at size 10 (maybe a little wide, which is good for me), while the Hydros were a half to full size bigger than the Canyoneers in a 10.  Overall, I like both shoes and use the Canyoneers for 'dry mud' and technical caves with little water and the Hydros for anywhere that has a lot of water, sand, and/or loose debris.  I think the Adidas are a bit more of an all-around shoe.	2015-08-12

When I found these at half of that price, I had to get them. I ran 2 miles in them right out of the box and have been running on a cloud ever since. I always look for top of the line shoes and these do not disappoint. The gel in the sole eliminates hard trail shock, well ventilated, even the insoles are high quality. I highly recommend these shoes, even for walking.Your feet will be very happy, worth every dollar.	2015-08-12

I have used my washing machine and dryer to clean them once a week or every other week. I bought my first pair about 10 months ago and there is a small hole wearing in at the seam b/w the sole and the fabric of the slipper. I imagine that if they made them more durable it wouldn't be as comfortable. Still a wonderful slipper and a decent price, hence the re-purchase. I like that people can't really tell I'm wearing slippers too!	2015-08-12

I wear a 7 1/2 in every shoe, but a lot of the thong sandals seem to run large so I initially ordered a 7 in these. They were very much too small! I reordered an 8 and they barely fit. The only complaint that I have really, is that the soles are very stiff. I can tell that the soles have softened some and I hope they will continue to become more flexible with wear.	2015-08-12

It looks good and fits well, even on my wide feet. They are solid to walk on, and do not feel weak in any part of the shoe. I wish the color was a bit blacker, or maybe more matte, but it would not have deterred me from buying them if I had seen them at DSW first.  I will buy a few more pair soon, as black wedge heels are a staple in my wardrobe, and this shoe is a dependable one. It isn't a fancy shoe, but everything you want is there: attractive shape, comfort, low price, matches everything. I'll probably buy 2-3 more pair in case of emergencies.	2015-08-12

I thought the width of the shoe was accurate for 6 medium, however, I think the &#34;wide&#34; that I read in the other reviews may have been a remark about the shoe not conforming to the shape of  the foot. I found the area around the toes and the ball of the foot to be like a boat and at first glance I thought of returning them. But after some thought, that aspect of the shoe is tolerable. Given the benefit of soft leather it has that aah feeling I will enjoy these sandals. There is no arch support but I do not anticipate that will be a problem for me.  I took away one star for the general shoe shape/width at the toes and ball of foot. As far as comfortable all day wear, I have yet to give them a try for that. They feel so good now that I don't anticipate any problems there.	2015-08-12

Wore these shoes on a day long trek involving snorkeling, hiking, and kayaking. I kept these on the whole time. They dried out quickly, so it was easy getting in and out of the water while wearing them, they did not get heavy or trap a lot of water. You do want to watch out for a shoe tan, though. I usually wear a 10.5, and i ordered both the 10 and 11. The 11 was a little roomy, but was very comfortable, the 10 was too tight. I wore them barefoot and did not feel any rubbing and no blisters.	2015-08-12

Shipping:<br />They do not ship to APO, at least they didnt to me. Odd because Mostly military buy this boot.

Belleville makes good products, i always buy from them! however.. for some reason they sent me the wrong color boots. I ordered Coyote brown, they sent me Desert Tan. (still in regulation so its really just an annoyance.)<br /><br />The fit:<br />as expected, my last pair was a 10W and they were a bit too wide. These are also a bit too wide, but i thought the 9.5 would make up for it. Still a good fit, not perfect.. maybe a 10R would do better. (i typically wear 9.5-10w in most shoes/boots)<br /><br />My advice:<br />Ensure youre willing to get the wrong color boot. Or the wrong kind. Or you are willing to send it back if they do send you the wrong ones.<br /><br />one star, because well... I didn't get the product i bought. I got something completely different.	2015-08-12

So I got another case separately.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with my gift. Always recommend to buy authentic MK like these.	2015-08-12

None of the marketing terms used to try to convince people that slightly wider than D shoes are really just as wide as you need them to be. These shoes fit, in size 9W. So they are at least a 1/2 size larger than marked. Since &#34;W&#34; is a marketing label and not a shoe sizing term, I cannot say if they are wider than &#34;wide,&#34; whatever that is supposed to mean. I can only say that the 9W fits a 9.5EEE perfectly well.	2015-08-12

Instead, this is a minimal-design shoe that looks great with a casual summertime outfit when you're basically just hanging around or walking around.<br /><br />On a cruise, at the beach, visiting your pals at their lake house, watching a ballgame---these clean white sneakers are comfortable, yet still look polished enough to stop off at a restaurant or bar without looking like a slob who just came from the gym. Pair with a Polo shirt and seersucker skirt or Bermuda shorts: casual but classy.<br /><br />The leather is firm, not thin, so these keep their shape instead of stretching out into a sloppy mess. Easy to keep clean as well. These are heavier than many athletic shoes, true; they last a lot longer (and still look new) with proper care. Well worth the investment to have one pair of sneakers in the closet for certain summer occasions.	2015-08-12

It seems that Nike makes less good quality shoes and their prices keep increasing. This shoe EXTREMELY hurt my Left feet as I'm now more active and go hiking and running. NEVER have had any problems with Nike shoes. So sad that many &#34;brand names&#34; use their big brand to rip off clients and no longer make good quality products for profits. NEVER will I buy a pair of Nike shoes ever again. After hiking just for 5 miles my left foot was completely injured and I also called Nike for help and they did NOTHING to help me about this defect on my shoe that injured my foot.	2015-08-12

They are so cushioned inside and feel like clouds rather than just a hard sole without padding like many other boots I've owned. Clearly you get what you pay for and these are well worth the Amazon discounted price. I ordered my regular size (size 9) and had no problems with the boots fitting. I do have narrow feet and narrow slender calves and ankles though. I can't wait to wear these are really get an idea of how they feel after a while day.	2015-08-12

For a number of years I was using the Teva Obern sandal which was a great sandal for all types of terrain, talus, scree, boulders, tundra and trails. So when Teva stopped making the Obern I had to find a new sandal, bummer. It was between the Toachi 2 and the Terra FI 4, I ended up choosing the Toachi for two reasons, the water draining feature which is really awesome since I have to forge through creeks and lakes often when off trail and the plastic clip which is great for everyday use. When I got this sandal out in the backcountry I found out this sandal is totally designed for boat use. It has absolutely no use in the backcountry since there is very little tread and the foot bed is very flimsy. I've taken this sandal out in the backcountry four times on 10-15 mile hikes often with no trail and every time I have taken a fall because of the sandals and I almost never fall. The last fall I took I did some damage to my toes and I will be out for recovery for at least six weeks before I can aggressively start hiking again. For everyday use this sandal is very comfortable but that's not what I need. I found a pair of Obern's on Ebay but they are a half size to big so if they do not work I'll give the FI 4 a try and see how they compare to the Obern which was a bomb proof sandal.	2015-08-12

I am a 8.5/40 and these are very true to size.  I tried at least 5 others before these and am very happy I kept looking.  One gripe is that the first pair I ordered were missing threads for one clip screw (from the factory I'm sure) so not really the sellers' fault but...erg.  My replacements are perfect though.  Will try to update once I have some more miles on these.	2015-08-12

I walk 45 minutes 3-4 times a week on pavement and trails and these shoes are so comfortable. I also have the ASICS gel walking shoe that I wear for every day, and it is the most comfortable shoe that I have.

After testing them out and walking around in them for a few hours, I got multiple blisters where the straps are. When I took them off, the bottom of my feet were coated in black residue from the flip flop, and the straps were too large for my feet so I kept slipping out of them. As some have noted, these are much heavier than you would expect from a flip flop. These are fine for a casual stroll, but I do not recommend using them for longer than that. Definitely not bringing these on my trip, but unfortunately since I had to wear them to test them out, I can't return them.	2015-08-12

I've bought a lot of Demonia boots over the years. I love them for their aesthetics and their unexpected lightness, and personally find them pretty comfy and easy to walk in. They mostly fit as expected BUT! be prepared to loosen the calf area (my calves are pretty small and these are still tight on them).<br /><br />I give these only 4 stars because Demonia boots tend to disintegrate around the year mark, and/because the materials are cheap (vinyl, foam, and aluminum). These also offer literally no arch support or cushioning, either -- grab some Dr. Scholl's after throwing these into your shopping cart.	2015-08-12

US	52761203	R3SFOPJ4XHENJA	B00MWZFQQ4	77746113	Calvin Klein Reversible N/S Novelty Tote Bag	Shoes	4	4	4	N	Y	Revised review	Not too sure yet.  It just arrived in UPS and I immediately turned it inside out because I wanted the white for summer.  Unfortunately this is not truly reversible in the strictest sense of the word.  You see there is the little zip pouch on a leash that clips to the inside of the bag?  All the hooks for clipping it are mounted on the white side of the bag.  Yes, I could clip it to the handle clasps, but then I have these random D-rings sticking out on the white side.  Also, the handles are only black, which is going to look silly with the white side out.  I'd expected the handles to be white on one side and black on the other.  Lastly, there is a 'Made in China' tag sewn down so that when the white side is out, this tag sticks out.  I could cut it off, and if I keep this bag, I will, but am not sure yet.  Initially I was hesitant to pay this price for PVC when there are many other reversible totes that are a lot cheaper, but this one looks dressier overall and that was nice.  Except that with the white side out, the tag, black straps, and D-rings for the inner pouch make it look cheap.  Edited a couple hours later:  those d-rings are for the crossbody strap, and since I have an ivory crossbody strap around here somewhere, I may yet keep this...depends if I can accustom myself to the black short straps.  Note that I had to go to Macy's website to look at pictures and figure this out!	2015-08-12

What woman does not love shoes This was my first time buying Riverberry's Gaby Fashion Stiletto Heels. I bought a size 8 and they run very true to size. I bought the nude pair so I could wear them with everything. I work in an office setting so I have to wear heels all day long and  they didn't even bother me until I was 9 hrs into them. They are the perfect height. They don't make you to tall but still make your legs look long and slender. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-12

The pink leather stripe came loose and started to peel off. I just glued it back down with some super glue. It is going on 2 weeks of staying put.

I will be able to test this theory when the seasons change and the weather becomes cooler. If they continue to hurt even when it is cold outside then I will know for sure that these boots and my poor feet are not a match.

I had been seriously shopping for a pair of folding glasses for some time to toss in my pocket to use at restaurants and the like.  When I saw a news segment about these glasses I immediately came on to Amazon and, Lo!, there they were. Mostly, I think these things are great. I bought the &#34;universal case&#34; and simply carry it in my pocket for the times when I'm without my reading glasses (restaurants, in a meeting, on a plane, etc.). I've never gotten the impression they are to be considered replacements for ones regular reading glasses and they're not.  With that said, they sit comfortably and firmly on my nose and I never feel like they are going to slip off and, at the same time, they are light enough to be comfortable to wear for longer periods if need be.<br /><br />With that said, my one complaint about them, and this is why I only rated them 3 stars, is that the lenses have scratched quite noticeably.  I've been using these glasses for about a month now and most of that time they are in the case in my pocket and, still, they are pretty scratched up. I'm not sure if there is some lint/dirt from my pocket making its way into the case and causing the scratching or what the issue is. When I read the product description, I read &#34;shatter-proof lenses&#34; as &#34;scratch resistant&#34; as well - apparently that isn't the case.  As another reviewer mentioned, maybe lining the case with felt or some other material would mitigate the issue.<br /><br />Overall, I would, and still do, recommend these glasses to people, but now caveat my recommendation with the warning about scratching.  If they get a handle on the scratched lens issue, this would be a 5 star review, no questions asked.	2015-08-12

I recently bought this pair of shoes at a local running store (like within the past 3 months) and thought that I would buy another pair since I liked them so much.  I opted to buy them on Amazon because I have Prime and there is a 10% discount.  I was a bit nervious about this, because who buys a pair of shoes without trying them on, right?  But I figured if I already had a pair, wouldn't they just fit exactly like my current pair? Wrong. First, I received the package on a rainy day, and it was left outside on my porch until I came home from work.  This isn't normally a problem, but it was packaged in a plastic shipping bag, with the Mizuno shoes in a cardboard shoe box inside.  When I opened the package, the cardboard box was mushy, and soaked.  The plastic packaging was not sufficient for rainy weather.  Luckily the shoes were not terribly soaked or too wet. I've worn the shoes exactly three times for at least 2 mile walks on my treadmill (to break them in). Second, I can't believe that these are the same pair of Mizuno shoes.  They feel NOTHING like the other comfy, cushiony pair that I already had.  Again, these are the exact same style (albeit a different color), so I can't figure out why they are hard, rigid, offer little arch support, and feel like there is absolutely no cushioning.  I find it hard to believe that I haven't broken them in enough, because the other pair of shoes I bought in-store felt perfect the moment I tried them on.  Needless to say, I will be returning these shoes to Amazon. From this process I learned a valuable lesson: just pay the extra money to get the shoes at my local running store. It's not worth the time and hassle I've invested in this.	2015-08-12

This is an adorable shoe. We purchased them as a supportive walking shoe but the verdict is not in just yet. Autumn is 10 months old and she's taking a few steps right now. Here's a million dollar question: How do you know if a shoe is comfortable for a toddler? Well, we were very pleased with the sooner than expected delivery. Also, the fact that it is a Stride Rite Footwear and a Mary Jane style makes it a great purchase. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because it's hard to know about the fit. Nonetheless, we are happy about these shoes.	2015-08-12

Update: these went from a 4 star to a 1. Why? Because they broke down fast. Honestly - I absolutely loved these shoes the first few weeks. They fit great, performed well, etc. (see original review below). 5 weeks in, however, they had developed a hole on the upper, by one of the laces. I found that peculiar, because I hadn't been particularly aggressive with them. I contacted Climb X customer service to see if they'd warranty the shoe. They replied that they don't do that because people have &#34;different climbing styles&#34;. I'm sorry - but if these piece of crap shoes can't withstand 5 weeks of moderate indoor climbing, they're worthless. I get that it's a cheap intro level shoe, and I'm not expecting pro quality - but at least moderate durability. They're garbage. Spend a few extra bucks on some La Sportivas or Scarpas.<br /><br />Original review:<br />--<br />I've worn these shoes for 15 straight days of indoor bouldering now, each session ~2 hours in length, and I'm VERY pleased with them. The price was of course great, but what I didn't expect was the quality. They fit great - I'm normally a size 10.5 and I was advised to size down for climbing shoes, but I tried them on in person, and the 10.5 fit me well. My toes curl in slightly, and they're just breaking in now and seem to fit perfectly.<br /><br />I like the ridged heel, and personally, I like the toe on these, though I think they're not for everyone. Some folks like a pointier toe, but I prefer mine just a bit squared. I'm an intermediate climber and I think these will last me a while. The hemp footbed is one of my favorite features because it has so far withstood my stinky feet and doesn't seem to retain any odors.	2015-08-12

The good: Beautifully made Right width for my medium width feet Good back support (no arch support) Very comfortable  The bad: The strap around the ankle is ridiculously wide.

It's a shame but I just cannot wear them.	2015-08-12

I almost returned them due to this, but I like the rest of the boot too much.  These are my first Frye boots and I was truly impressed with their construction and leather quality. I slipped them on and they fit great but must run a little small. I am a 10.5E, but they only offer regular widths (10.5M) and the fit was spot on, if not just a little snug.  I should have known from the description as being &#34;western&#34; boots, but from the pictures I thought these might be a little more round on the toe; they do in fact look a little more &#34;western&#34; than the pictures imply. I like a boot that can fit in anywhere from the country, or even the city; where boots made of good leather can almost pass as a casual dress shoe.  These boots are on the very edge of that spectrum, so I will definitely be keeping them.	2015-08-12

First the pros: The insole is more cushy (slightly spongy) than all my previous FifFlop sandals.  Nice! I ordered the dark olive.  It is a slightly brushed/nubuck leather that goes with many colors: most shades of brown plus black, gray and some shades of green etc. The straps allow for some adjustability. They can be worn with all length of pants:  long, medium and short to r-e-a-l-ly short!  Skirts too. They were comfortable right out of the box, and I can wear them happily all day....even when my feet quickly turn from normal to disgustingly puffy!! The arch support is a pretty good one. This is a style that just might appeal to young as well as the mature ladies.  Now the cons: They run looong!  I have learned from experience that this brand usually runs big, and I do allow for that when making a purchase.  I have learned to buy a size smaller than my normal size when purchasing FitFlops.  I ordered my usual size 7 (38) which is the size of  ALL  of my  FitFlops, and that is quite a few.  This pair; however, allows for a good 1/2-3/4 inch of sole beyond my toes.  Yes, I probably should have exchanged them, but the size is just o.k......not perfect.  This sandal runs LARGE.....at least for me.  As mentioned in the pros:  The straps allow for some adjustability; however, there will be some velcro showing if you have to loosen the straps more than a smidge.  Since the velcro is the same color as the shoe that does not spoil the appearance of the shoe very much. The straps may stick out if you have to tighten them more than a smidge to get a desirable fit. These sandals, in fact this brand, will probably not be suitable for a narrow foot.  They also run a bit wider than lots of other brands.  I do recommend these sandals, but keep in mind they may be a bit long....and maybe a smidge wide for some feet.	2015-08-12

These were so small, i even ordered a size larger than normal to compensate for the swelling, regardless of her feet being swollen, i have smaller size feet than her and i couldnt ware them. Im usually a 9 i would have had to order a size 11 to fit. She never wore them, sadly she died a few days after I got them for her. I think these ended up in a yard sale brand new.	2015-08-12

I keep on returning to Saucony, for their fit, comfort, and durability.  The Cohesion model also has the wonderful advantage of reasonable cost.  I really wear my sneakers, some every day, some days all day, for street walking, tromping around in moderate woods, doing yard work, etc.  Sauconys handle everything and stay comfortable.  My one gripe, and it's not a major one, is that over the past five years or so, the tongue in every pair of Sauconys I've had has had a tendency to move, leaving a gap between the rest of the shoe and the tongue.  Not sure what causes this, but it's more of an aesthetic than a wearability issue.	2015-08-12

I went up a half size and was surprised that even though I have a normal to narrow-size foot, the straps that go across the top of the foot were a bit tight even though I put it on the last hole on the strap.  Since I have worn them they have stretched a dash so they are more comfortable though.  I have thin legs so the straps on my legs were just fine once adjusted.  I like the height of the sandals and they don't fall down when walking like some gladiators do.  I really like these sandals, but I wouldn't recommend them if you have wide feet.	2015-08-12

Well........ these sandals are quite a disappointment given how cute they look on the website pic. I bought them in brown colour and the colour in person is not as bright as on the photo. The sandal runs somewhat small and given that the foot keeps sliding forward the toes go way over the edge. Also, the fit around the toes is quite wide which significantly contributes to the foot sliding forward and there is no way to tighten it. So I cannot order the next size up because the fit around the front of the foot would be even larger. Unfortunate. I was really looking forward to these.	2015-08-12

I have owned many many pairs over the decades.  The selection has become so varied and excessive, its hard to pick out one that you like without spending a small fortune.<br /><br />I have always liked Reebok and this sneaker fits awesome and looks stylish.

US	7415451	R2O3N2KJURVNOR	B00FEPKTFC	460027082	Women's Strappy Open Toe Platform Wedge	Shoes	2	0	0	N	Y	not worth it	I was so disappointed in these shoes. They aren't the most expensive pair in the world but they are NOT worth the price. First off they are tight. There is nothing special about my feet. I am a size 7.5. No question about it and even after a few wears to break them in they are still really tight. They also have zippers in the back that dig into your heels. The quality is  really bad. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a pair that will last more than 5 wears. I gave it two stars instead of one though because the color is true to the picture and I bought them because of the color.	2015-08-12

They're a little goofy looking in my opinion but boy are they comfy! They quickly went from my yoga shoe to my comfy walking shoe. I live in a city and do a fair amount of walking to get around whenever possible. These are now my go-to comfy shoe, preferred to sneakers in the summer. I read reviews prior to purchase and was confused why people said these aren't easy to put on. Having received them and put them on multiple times, I'm just as confused! This isn't a complicated shoe! And it's faster to put on than buckling a sandal or tying a shoe. The style has grown on me and I'll probably be ordering another pattern soon!	2015-08-12

I got these insoles as a treatment for a case of plantar faciitis.  However, I now wish I had purchased the version which provides more support.  Without a doubt, these insoles are good but I think more arch support would have been more therapeutic in the treatment of my malady.  As you might expect, using these will may require that you remove the &#34;OEM&#34; insole from you shoe.  If you don't do this, then the fit of your shoe may be a bit tight on the top and this will require a loosening of the laces.<br /><br />As mentioned, these insoles are comfortable and I can walk all day.  I just wish they were a quicker remedy for my plantar faciitis.	2015-08-12

The area around the heel is cushier on the outside than it is on the inside and it doesn't hold the back of your foot very well. The top edge behind the Achilles is a little too pointy and can dig into your leg after a while, but adding an aftermarket stick on pad to the wall there helped fix a lot of these issues. The laces could also use another set of holes further back to help hold the shoe more securely. Aside from the heel area these shoes are solid and quite comfy for long periods of time and it's the only way I can sneak barefoot shoes into work meetings or places with a dress code.	2015-08-12

Of these 9 shoes, 6 are size 42 and 3 are size 41. So, I bought one of these shoes in a size 41 and one of these in a size 42. The problem? The 41s were very snug on my toes and the footbed was narrow. Ok, so I'll try the 42s, whoops, these were much too roomy (though still narrow in the toes). Trying to figure out the problem, I compared footbed inserts of these size 42s with my other 42s. Result: these were about 1/2 size longer. Long story short...sadly both had to go back. Also, it had a weird high arch support in both that made my feet lean inward.	2015-08-12

I would say the quality is not the best.  There is one shoe lace holder made out of a strap.  This strap is very poorly connected to the shoe.  I had one bust the first time I put on the shoe while I was trying to tighten the laces, and another bust on the other shoe like the 3rd or 4th time I wore them.  I didn't pay a ton for these shoes, so I'm not that worried about it.  However, these are definitely not quality shoes for the list price.	2015-08-12

They have great arch support and fit perfectly. This style of shoe has a loose fit to allow you to slip in and out of them and to let your feet to move the way they are supposed to. The materials are super soft, and I have never had any irritating rubbing or blisters. I can wear these shoes walking for hours and my feet feel great. My feet do not get sweaty in these sandals because of how open and airy they are. Also the button is there only for aesthetics, the parts of the shoe are really connected by a stretchy elastic fabric thing that makes it really easy to slip the shoes on and off. You do not have to button or unbutton anything. Can't wait to get another pair!!!	2015-08-12

I first saw them at Tilly's a few weeks back but put off buying them. They sold out quickly so I searched for another seller and found them on this amazon page. The price was more than Tilly's had been offering them, (about 6 dollars more) but I'm still happy with them. They're durable and stylish sandals. The only con is the sizing of the sandals is a bit off. I'm usually a size 5 in womens but these sandals run small so I ordered a size 7, which fits perfectly. I own another pair of City Classified sandals and they run small too and much like this case I had to go with a size 7. So be prepared to size up. Overall I'm happy with the product and shipping as fast. Would recommend this product.	2015-08-12

Definitely do not recommend.	2015-08-12

More as soon as the smell goes away	***UPDATE*** Now 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />Lol it took 9months+ but the smell is completely gone! NOW I get to enjoy using this awesome huge purse✔<br />I've had this purse for 4days...Overall it's great! Exactly as described. I got the Tan color,it's gorgeous.  Very good quality workmanship. Love the &#34;antiquing&#34; of the hardware and zippers. All zippers move very smoothly. As others have said, the front outside pocket will hold a pen or two. I think it's mainly decorative. The back outside pocket is good sized. The handles are very sturdy, I personally love the rolled handles as I think it looks & feels better in hand than flat would. The attachable strap is very long and we'll made also. Inside there's 2 side pockets for a cell (I've got a Samsung Galaxy S5 & it fits completely) and either a small wallet or keys, so they don't fall into the abyss of this huge purse, they're both trimmed with a leather-like darker brown band on top. There's also a large inside zippered pocket. The lining inside seems very strong overall  The top zipper is great because I just don't trust magnetic snaps... Now on to the smell ~ oh my goodness it's horrible. I opened a pkg of snuggle dryer sheets and used the entire 30 sheets to try and lesson the ucky nasty kinda fishy odor. Just stuck them into every opening and everyplace inside. I throughly sprayed fabreeze on the outside also. I'm hoping that this will resolve it to the point that I don't gag when I'm holding it. I really love this purse! And sincerely can't wait to actually use it. Just need to get the smell gone. Then it'll be a 5+ ☆ review.	2015-08-12

These boots are so much better than I could have ever anticipated.  I do wish they were a bit higher but these days I really don't think you can find a functional quality winter boot that comes to the knee like when I was a kid.<br /><br />The boots come about 1/2 way up my calf and they are wide enough at the top so that I can tuck in my jeans without problem.  They are extremely comfortable and run just a bit big.  I wear a 10 and they have enough room that I can wear my wool hunting socks in them without being too tight.  The zipper part is my favorite I think.  I have been wearing Bear Paw boots for the last six years and though they are nice and warm they would hurt my feet and legs because of no arch support.  These do have support.  They are very well made and should last me at least six more years thus for the $48 and change I paid for them, they won't owe me a dime.  The brown color is nice and dark more like a dark chestnut.<br /><br />If you are looking for a pair of boots and have wide feet or wide calves give these a try.  They are stylish, comfortable, well made and just plain worth it.  I'm more than happy with my choice and I'm picky!	2015-08-12

The only reason I didn't rate these shoes a 5 is because of the slight sizing issue, but other than that, I absolutely love them!

The color of the beige is the exact &#34;nude&#34; color that I was looking for. I read other reviews that said the heel was too high...not so for me. They were perfect.

I normally wear 43 - most of my shoes are in that size; Timberland shoes are the exception.  I have Wodehouse Chukkas in 9D (the label on the shoe says it's size 43), and I can wear them with a thick wooly sock without feeling too constricted.  My boat shoes are 9.5W (the label also says it's size 43) - feel great naked and with a thin sock. These I got in 9W (yes, it's size 43, according to the label) based on other reviewers' recommendations to size down and they are way too tight for my wide feet even without a sock.<br /><br />If you can't try these at the store, order a few sizes and return the ones that do not fit.  Other than sizing, these are def a keeper.	2015-08-12

I bought these Teva Tidepool sandals for my daughter to wear as water shoes, but they are so comfortable she has been wearing them everywhere! She wears a 7 in Skechers, and I ordered a 7 in the Teva.  The Teva is about .5&#34; to 1&#34; too big on her foot, and very wide, but the straps are velcro and she was able to tighten them to where they didn't flop around on her foot.  I don't think they are the cutest sandals, but they are light and comfortable, so that's all that matters.	2015-08-12

Unlike other brands, this boot is very easy to put on your foot.This is my third pair in 2.5 years. Only complaint is that I can only get about 10 months out of the sole before traction is lost and the boot becomes unsafe in wet conditions on commercial single-ply membrane roofs. I wear my older ones to knock around and only wear the newer ones to work in an attempt to prolong the life. I wish Carhart would upgrade this boot to a true slip-resistant sole instead of the offered oil-resistant--I would surely be able to get a several more months of use out of them. When these wear out, I will buy them again.	2015-08-12

The sole of the shoe doesn't cake mud when you are taking a hike on a muddy trail or enjoying a mud run.<br /><br />If ordering from Amazon direct.  You may want to be wary of the information posted for the shoes.  The size indicated on Amazon's webpage was for a 6 1/2 B (medium).  The first pair I received was a 6 1/2 D (WIDE).  I requested a replacement pair since the shoe received was NOT the shoe ordered.  The replacement pair was received in a WIDE too.  Unfortunately, it leaves me with the dilemma to keep one of the pairs and deal with the width being too big OR return both pairs and purchase from another dealer.	2015-08-12

This is a fantastic, compact wallet that feels like butter and is deceptively roomy!  There is a place for everything ~ cards fit beautifully, there is a generous compartment for coins, and, because I don't use many anyway, I have torn several checks from my book and placed them inside.  I typically prefer richer browns, but this lighter taupe color is truly lovely.  It's easy to carry, and takes up considerably less room in my purse than my previously standard sized wallet.

I've been wearing this brand for 7 years straight and can tell you for sure that fit and quality does NOT correlate with price! This is why I always buy my Asics on Amazon and if I'm not familiar with a particular model, I look it up on the Asics website to see what kind of shoe it is. This is a neutral shoe but it has great support and fits my wide feet quite well. Perhaps if you have a smaller foot, the shoe is built more narrow, but in an 11 it is plenty wide. If for some reason it doesn't have enough cushion for you, you can get gel heel cups which are a MIRACLE for those of us who tend toward plantar fasciitis (I use Spenco brand, also from Amazon). But this is a supportive, lightweight shoe and I recommend it. There truly is NO NEED to spend 100 bucks on running shoes! It isn't the most beautiful running shoe out there, but who cares! :)	2015-08-12

The Extra Wide was too wide. I could not find just a wide size.  The biggest issue for me is the size of the toe box. It is a bit narrow for me. Being on my feet 12 hrs a day, my feet swell a bit toward the end of the day. The shoe is very comfortable. If you are on your feet for a considerable amount of time, think about a wide size, if you can find them.	2015-08-12

The double velcro closures cinch the toe area and the one around the heel area snugs up well.  I could use another inch of velcro tape on all locations, but for a product meant for medium width feet it works fine for me.  Right out of the box I walked in them for several hours with no chafing.  The footbed is very supportive and comfortable, and I like the way my feet feel stable, with no side to side motion.  They are very lightweight but with good traction.	2015-08-12

I guess I have even smaller calves than the other small calved posters - I can still stick my hand in by my calf. And the ankle is too big. Otherwise nice boot, the detail is actually a join in the leather and the inside lining of the boot has an extra layer there, venting maybe? The lining seems warm, like neoprene and the footbed is comfortable and cushy. The leather doesn't 'unfold' well. They have ripples when on at the front and back seams	2015-08-12

Not a bad pair of cheaper sunglasses at all. Both its lenses are equally dark and have the same polarization effect. At first I thought I was being lied to that the frames were metal when they sounded like plastic when tapped and scratched with your fingernail, but they are definitely aluminum as I can't even bend the ear piece and they feel solid when you fold them. They feel comfortable when I wear them and I can even adjust the nose pads by bending them carefully since they are also metal. Some reviewers say that these glasses stick out away from their faces too much, but for me they don't at all since my eye sockets are a little deeper to where the top of the frame just barely touches my lower forehead. The sides of the lenses don't block the sun 100% if the bothers you, but they are more than adequate for me. I like the little screwdriver it comes with. It has 2 ends, one being a straight end and the other being a phillips end. Both sides have caps that you screw on and even a have tiny rubber o-rings. Overall very good to me.	2015-08-12

I'm collecting things to create a big gift basket for my best friend and I'm absolutely in love with these little shoes. I picked the orange pair with the pink elephant and they are adorable - the synthetic leather is very soft, as is the inside of the shoe. The stitching is precise, the colors are bright and vibrant and there's elastic going across where the &#34;tongue&#34; of the shoe would be and this allows the shoes to stretch out well enough to fit chubby little baby feet snuggly inside. The shoes also come in a cute little display box with a windowed front, flip top and a soft roped handle on the top - these will a perfect addition to my gift basket. I was given the opportunity to purchase these shoes at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbaised review and all observations and opinions are mine. I would definitely recommend these to a friend or anyone looking for a baby gift.	2015-08-12

The seams are even, the stitching well done and the hardware is polished but sturdy. I was a little worried at not being able to touch the fabric. No problem. It not only has good weight, it has a slightly polished sheen to it. I expect it will stand up to years of use. Now to the inside. The design is well thought and just as well constructed. The outer compartments, two on front and one in back, zip easily and have good room for cell phone, ipod, digital camera in front and mini ipad or kindle in back. Inside there are 5 credit card pockets on the right with a flat deep pocket behind them, a cell phone size pocket on the left, AND and an inner zipped pocket nearly the size of the whole purse. Also, there is an attached key fob and an attached coin purse. I purchased the aquamarine color and the inside fabric is silk-like and light yellow. The strap as it arrived is perfect length for over the shoulder. It is easy to make it longer for cross body use.

I can wear them without socks and they're okay, but would prefer to wear with booties or socks.

It gets 4 because	I'm giving this bag 4 stars, but there is nothing wrong with it - it's a great bag.  It gets 4 because, though I wanted a medium size bag, it's just a little smaller than I thought.  I have the SakRoots XL wallet, and it fits fine in the bag but there's not much room for anything else.  Also, the cell phone slit on the outside back fits a smart phone, but not one with any kind of a protective case - I have an otterbox on a Galaxy 5S and it won't fit in the slot, so I have to put it inside the bag.  And one last thing is that the pockets on the inside are very shallow - they don't go all the way down to the bottom of the bag, so pens or sunglasses won't go in the pockets.<br />I love the color, the style, and the drop on the handle is perfect - which is really hard to find - it's just not quite big enough for me.	2015-08-12

The glasses are true to their listed measurements.<br /><br />I am fairly pleased with the product, but make no mistake- these are still cheap sunglasses and they aren't much more than that.	2015-08-12

If your answer was 'comfort,' then keep on looking.<br /><br />I know everybody's feet are different, and this shoe has a lot of great reviews- that's why I bought a pair. But I thought it would be fair to the prospective buyer to counterbalance all the other reviews by adding my experience, which has been terrible. I had read several reviews about no break-in period, and one that said something about throwing them in a suitcase for a trip, and then walking all around in them. That last bit in particular got my attention. My dog had eaten my two very comfortable pairs of sneakers (my fault, I should not have left them out). I had put off replacing them for a month or two, but then I needed to take a trip.<br /><br />When I got these, I found they were kinda cute-ugly, perfectly fine for ordinary activities. I walked around the house a little, and didn't find any major issues. They have a hard rubber bottom, nothing special. You can't tell from looking at them, but there is a little bit of heel, maybe between 1/4 and 1/2 an inch. You can feel it when you're standing in them. The leather is nice. Wasn't really sure why they cost more than my running sneakers, but they were fine. I also haven't had issues with shoes in years, so I wasn't particularly worried about it. (Again, that is why I am willing to spend more money on shoes; comfort is fairly important to me.)<br /><br />BIG mistake. I got blisters and blisters. Right at the back of the heel. To the right of that. To the left of that. Above that. Holy cow. Talk about hobbling around. AND these shoes make my feet fall asleep while I am wearing them. Strange, I know. I tried pulling out the insole and using a pair of my beloved Superfeet (special insoles), but the shoe was too shallow for this to work well. So now these shoes are relegated to short trips to the supermarket. And even so, I can still feel a little warmness in the heel that tells me if I wear them any longer, I will get blisters again. And sometimes I can tell my toes are starting to go numb.<br /><br />I feel like these were a big waste of money for me. On my trip, I walked over ten miles, and these suckers are still not 'broken in.' I don't think they ever will be. Two stars because I like the leather and the eco-friendly nature of the materials.if I wear them any longer, I will get blisters again.

First, let me start by saying, this bag is so close to perfect it is painful for me to give it 3 stars. I was looking for something that would function as a purse for me and mini-diaper bag for my toddler's stuff. This bag is great - it fits my wallet and various purse stuff, his diaper changing pad from SkipHop, I can fit his Thermos funtainer in the side mesh pocket, and the other pocket fits my iPhone 6, plus I have room for more - I often carry snacks, extra wipes, small toys, etc.! And even with all this room, the bag doesn't seem huge or bulky. The material is great, resistant to stains, the blue color is vibrant, the zippers are comfortable and zip nicely...it's awesome.<br /><br />Here's the problem. I'm 5'2&#34;, and the bag just will NOT stay in place on my back. If I shift or squat down, the whole bag rotates around off my back and ends up under my left arm near my hip. Once that meant it ended up in a water play table I was standing at with my son (although luckily the water resistant material kept my stuff dry). The strap needs a grip material or something, or the straps need to be shorter? The constant sliding around to the front also chafes my neck. The metal buckles that hold the straps to the length you want also let the straps come loose easily. If there was a way to convert this to a traditional backpack with two straps, my life would be amazing and I'd have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />It's the perfect bag except for the huge flaw, the frustration of the crossbody strap is enough to make me not want to use it, but the functionality, space, and quality of the rest of the bag keeps me struggling with it. It's honestly a fine line right now. A true love/hate relationship.	2015-08-12

I chose the metallic color frame and I like the smokey color lenses.The sunglasses tint is kind of dark enough to protects my eyes on sunny days. The best thing about these sunglasses was its lenses are polarized therefore it terminate light glare and give clear vision while using it. It's frames are made of nickel plated metal and the hinges appears to be spring metal. The glasses did come with a soft pouch, that help protect the lenses from being scratched.

Shoes fit exactly as expected, had a very short break-in period, and are some of the most comfortable shoes I've worn.  Not overly dressy but definitely classy enough to wear with a suit, should you choose.  I was looking for a lightweight pair of casual dress boots/shoes, and these have filled that qualification perfectly.  So much so that I purchased a second pair, of the red/brown model.  Very satisfied and would definitely purchase again.  Do not hesitate to buy.	2015-08-12

My previous pair of dress shoes I'd wear, a pair of Nunn Brush oxfords, had the leather badly gouged. These shoes, fitted at my local Lamey Wellehan, are simply amazing. I can wear these for ten hour shifts without pain. Plus, I get compliments how they look.<br />As with any other dress shoe, they do need regular polishing/brushing. A $4.00 Kiwi container of shoe polish and a $6.00 shoe brush have served me well in the upkeep of this shoe.<br />In conclusion, then, I strongly recommend this shoe based on its qualities of appearance, fit, durability, and relative comfort.	2015-08-12

I ordered a 5, and after receiving the initial product, it took me 15-20 minutes to finally get them on; comparing the souls to my other minnetonka's that are similar, they are significantly more slender. i have fat feet, but through great determination, i have been able to stretch them out. other than that, one of the zippers does like to slowly unzip after moving around, but not a big deal. i get fantastic comments on them anyways!	2015-08-12

Although the heal is high	Very soft leather which makes wearing comfortable. Although the heal is high, it doesn't feel high because the front has a platform. I can walk as fast as in loafers (important in a fast-paced city like NYC!). I also liked that you can chose the width. I have narrow feet and usually have trouble finding narrower shoes. They also have wide.<br />Shipping was prompt as was the return of my first order. I initially ordered a size too small and when I requested a replacement shipment, they even refunded $0.40 because the price had dropped in the meantime. Will definitely order more from this company!	2015-08-12

This purse is the most precious purse ever. I love it so much.<br /><br />It's like, not huge like a mom purse but at the same time it's not a tiny useless coin purse. I can put all kinds of junk in here and it fits perfectly. It's also really soft and high quality, which is great. I was kind of shocked at how inexpensive it is for such a good thing, but that's probably because it's made of fake leather—not that I mind.<br /><br />The top zipper is nice and snug and hasn't slipped, though the bag isn't rain-safe or anything. In addition, there's a nice pouch on the back side of it that zips well. Inside the bag, there's two little pouches that're perfect for holding cards or a small wallet or your phone, and it also has a zip pocket on the other side of the purse that's a bit bigger. I almost immediately broke the zipper on that inner pouch, though... I have that issue with every purse though, not just this one, so I'm not sure if it's just that I'm dumb and break zippers a lot or that inside-purse zippers are just really fallible for some reason.	2015-08-12

I wear an 11D in the normal Jungle Mocs and the same size in the Ventilator model is tight enough to be distinctly uncomfortable after a couple hours...not sure I'll even be able to wear these enough to break them in and see if they stretch out. Merrell, if you're listening, please make sure you build your shoes on the same last, to the same dimensions for each size/width!	2015-08-12

I find they run a bit small - I generally wear an 8 or 8.5 but had to order a 9 in these which I have never had to do in my life.  Still they are cute and I was able to wear them all day (with a compression sleeve for my ankle as of course there is no support there) and will probably wear them tomorrow.

For months now I had been debating whether or not to purchase these boots. I bought a few different pairs of cowboy boots from other sites and it turned out to either not be what I expected or the boot ends up not fitting (too big). Most reviews recommend &#34;sizing up&#34; for cowboy boots. That's what I did on my previous purchases and the shoe was too big so I decided to stick to my regular shoe size for these. I ordered a size 8. The boot is ok. I like the style, heel is perfect. They feel ok, but they have that &#34;distressed&#34; look that I'm not too much a fan of. They look used. My right foot fit perfect but the left I couldn't even get my foot in. I've never had an issue with any of my shoes fitting differently so it's definitely the boot. It's the best deal I found on the Internet for a pair of cowboy boots so I can't really complain. I will order a 1/2 size up hoping they will fit better. 4 starts for this product: the price is good, the shipping speed was terrific!  Got them literally the next day with free standard shipping. The 2 things taking away the 5th star was the worn look and the left boot not fitting.	2015-08-12

They are very well designed and pair with a lot of clothes.  I wear them with shorts and pants.  My wife says they look really good with jeans (that's her favorite).  They do feel a little cheaply made and maybe a little thin in the sole but they probably need to be to look the way they do.  If they were thicker, it would lose some appeal.  They are comfortable though.  I usually wear them with no socks and haven't had a problem with them smelling or giving me blisters.<br /><br />Overall, I like they way they look, they are comfortable while feeling slightly on the cheap side.  A pretty good shoe.	2015-08-12

I was looking for something casual enough to wear with jeans but dressy enough to wear if I decide to throw on a jacket.  These boots fit the bill.  I read the review and generally agree with all of them.  These are $100 boots.  I don't expect the workmanship, quality, durability or comfort to be within a thousand miles of Fryes or Allen Edmonds.  If you are expecting that, buy Fryes or Allen Edmonds!  These are &#34;fashion boots&#34; plain and simple.  They look good and they fit over your feet, that's it.<br /><br />My initial impression of the leather was not great.  I definitely had that pleather look and feel.  But, one treatment with some Leather Honey and it softened right up and took on a much deeper, richer color.  I'll keep them soaked in it until they break in.<br /><br />There is no cushioning or support in these boots.  Tried pulling some insoles out of a pair of Sperry's I had near by but the toe box is too tight to be able to add them.  I'm not saying they are uncomfortable in any way, but they aren't something you are going to want to go hiking in.<br /><br />They run really big.  I wear 11.5 sneakers.  I bought these boots in 11 and there is still plenty of room in front of the toe.  I probably could go with a 10.5 but I'm not going to bother sending them back, the 11 is fine.<br /><br />I'm not really sure about the sole.  The rubbery bottom is a bit cheesy looking and I've read it doesn't hold up.  Frankly, part of me hopes it wears out.  I'll just run it over to the cobbler and have him put a better looking, better performing sole on for me.  It's cheap and easy so no worries there.<br /><br />If you like the look and style, want something between dress and casual and understand that they are just basic boots, you'll be happy with these.	2015-08-12

I have several pair of Venice H2 sandals that I use for aquatic exercise at the gym.  I've had them for a couple of years and though they are still quite sturdy, they are really faded.  So I decided to get some new ones and I thought the Celestial Blue was very pretty.  I am very sad to report that I had to return them though.  These were not nearly as roomy as the older Venice H2s.  In fact, I couldn't get my foot all the way into them even after several minutes struggling.  To be 100% fair, these are not sold as a wide shoe and I DO have a very wide foot with a high instep just to make matters a little worse.  However, Keens of the past fit me beautifully, and folks with normal feet could easily cinch up the bungee for a more snug fit.  The reason for one star deduction is the inconsistency of the fit, not because of quality.  As I said, the current shoes I own have served me well, and will continue to do so even though they don't look as bright as they once did.  I don't know what the heck I am going to do when I HAVE to replace them.  I really wish Keen would carry some wide style options.	2015-08-12

So, why not, right? Well they sent it over and the picture shows how many they sent. Two of the same type of laces that I originally purchased and FOUR of the thin kinds. Needless to say this was a pleasant surprise.

They look very smart - people have noticed and complimented them.  The straps are comfortable - they don't chafe in any spots, as other thongs/flats have done for me.  Clearly there is no arch support, but I've been able to wear them all day with casual walking and lounging.  The only downside is that the straps may give too much around the ankles while being properly snug around the toes - I found my heels slipping off the sandals towards the inside edges until I broke them in a bit better.  Perhaps if I'd ordered one size down as some other reviews recommended I wouldn't have had that issue, but after a few days of wear they were fine for me.	2015-08-12

I have a very high arch, so that presents somewhat of a problem.

I own several pairs of Sketchers that are very comfortable.  These Sketchers fit smaller and are less comfortable than all my other Sketchers due to the memory foam taking up space in the footbed.  This addition should have been compensated for in the size and comfort of the shoe.  The outside fabric doesn't come up as high because of the memory foam.  Because of this, the backside of the heel is lower and therefore causes slippage and rubs.. These shoes should have better arch support along with some adjustments for the memory foam which is a good addition.	2015-08-12

Sketchers shoes, like many brands made abroad, are hit or miss with their sizing.  I wear 8.5 and even in stores find same shoe and size fit differently. In general, I have found Sketcher's can run a quarter to half size small, thus take lots of breaking in. I have tried going half size larger, but foot seems to swim in the show.  I have used several models of Sketcher street shoes with gripping soles as my golf shoe of choice for 15 years. Discovering these specialty golf shoes at almost half the price in local golf stores, I took the chance and violated my long standing rule of never buying shoes online and unfitted. They remain tight, especially in the vamp and uppers. Toe space is adequate and length is good, but like other Sketchers, they run smaller than actual sizing, requiring extra toil and discomfort to break in. The quality of shoe seems solid, with minimal exposed stitching. If the soles wear out, as others have complained, will use for yard work. Wish they had a heal strap or bit higher heal collar, but they are good looking shoe. Advise ordering half size large than you may be used to.	2015-08-12

I always recommend the 16's and the previous ones as the most outstanding running shoes.  I have run in them for 12 years.

And if they fit, I suspect they would be very comforable. But the sizing business is utterly ridiculous. I wear a European 44. In some shoes (including my first KEEN shoes, a 43 is a better fit. I read the warnings that they run small, and took the advice to go up a half size. I ordered 45, and they fit like sausage casings and cut off circulation.  I suspect that even 46 might be too snug. NB; This is not just  a question of width. The 45s are barely long enough. If you are able to send shoes back and forth until you get the right fit, then go for it. These are a great design. (I live overseas, so can't swap until I get my size.) KEEN should really work out the true measurement of each of the UNEEK sizes and sell people the size they need. Throw a note int he box to tell people to ignore the size printed on the shoes.	2015-08-12
US	47597315	R2B49ZAV0K8APH	B0113DM410	743069314	Designer Inspired Quilted Crossbody Bag	Shoes	4	1	1	N	N	Cute purse, love the metal link strap!	This is a cute, classy little bag for a small price. The faux leather fabric is quilted and soft, it doesn't feel cheaply made. The metal medallion on the front adds interest, though I think I'd like it more if it was less abstract. From a distance it looks sort of like a tree. The purse is small but capable of holding all the essentials like your phone, lipstick, credit cards, etc. Perfect for a dressy night out when you don't want to haul a bigger bag around. My favorite part is the extra long crossbody strap, which is a strip of the purse fabric woven through metal links. The chances of this purse strap breaking are tiny! One issue I had is that I ordered the red color. The color in person is somewhat red but has a very dark brown tone. It's darker than the photo and definitely not a bright pop of red. I still do like it and think it will get plenty of use.<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.	2015-08-12

However they are not made well. I had the same issue as at least one other person with the eyelet breaking off within the first 2 or 3 uses. The laces didn't fit tight enough and I did roll my ankle. I went to return them, but between shipping costs and the delay I had to keep them as I was going on a 4-day previously booked trek and couldn't wait and wasn't about to try and break in another pair. The gamble paid off and these were comfy after a rub down with mink oil. But I'm still going to have to pay a cobbler to repair my boots.	2015-08-12

I am very happy with the fit. They looked great with my jeans and my dresses, so they were a great multitasking choice. I will definitely look into more Chaco purchases in the future.	2015-08-12

"[[VIDEOID:963645424e75760b2565eecc40f84c71]]I purchased this bag in March 2013. I have used it as my everyday handbag for about 2.5 years, and it still looks brand new!<br /><br />If you want a bag to help keep you organized, look no further. This bag has several sections, all with zipper closures:<br />-Two separate main compartments<br />-One interior pouch in the front main compartment<br />-One removable pouch<br />-Two small exterior compartments on the front of the bag<br />-One large exterior compartment on the back of the bag<br /><br />That's seven places to store your stuff! And . . . if you need just a little extra room, you can unzip the zipper on the bottom of the front main compartment to expand the bag. That gives you even more room for even more stuff! (Though, I prefer the look of the bag in its condensed mode and have never used the \\\"expansion pack.\\\\\" :))<br /><br />The bag itself is made of nylon, and consequently, it is lightweight. I actually purchased this bag because my traditional faux leather purse was a burden on my shoulder. It was heavy, even without any contents. This LeSportsac bag was a refreshing change. When completely empty, the bag weighs approximately 12.5 ounces. So, the bag really is only as heavy as you want it to be. Although, if you find the bag to be too heavy on your shoulder after a long day of shopping, simply adjust the strap and wear it as a crossbody bag.<br /><br />The tag inside my bag indicates you can wash it by hand in cold water and then hang it to dry. However, it warns that fading may occur during washing. It also states you should not iron the bag or use bleach or detergent. I have never attempted to wash my bag, but I did have a very unfortunate incident shortly after purchasing it. You don't need all of the details, but let's just say a piece of a peanut butter cup melted onto the exterior of my bag. I spot-cleaned the area with excellent results. As previously mentioned, my bag still looks brand new. (With the exception of that peanut butter cup, I actually do take very good care of my belongings. :))<br /><br />The main disadvantage of this bag is that it's pretty casual and might not be appropriate for all occasions. It's a very well-branded bag. \\\\\"LeSportsac\\\\\" is printed on all of the zipper pulls and in succession on the strap and on the trim on the front and back of the bag. I purchased my bag in black to use as an everyday handbag, and as an added bonus, the LeSportsac branding isn't quite as visible on the black version as it is on other prints.<br /><br />This has been a durable bag for me, and I have not had any issues with it. It makes a great organizational bag for daily use, and it is perfect for travel. I think you'll tire of the bag before the bag wears out on you. When that happens, simply remove your belongings and collapse the bag for easy storage.he exception of that peanut butter cup, I actually do take very good care of my belongings. :))<br /><br />The main disadvantage of this bag is that it's pretty casual and might not be appropriate for all occasions.

They dont fit right compared to the other 2 pairs. The strap that goes between your toes is to close. It makes my toes hang off. Im not happy and want another pair. Hopefully they will fix this and give me a discount on the.next pair. I want more though the other 2 pairs are comfy.	2015-08-12

Extremely light and fit my feet like a glove. Often I forget that I have them on.<br />2) Performance =  4 Stars. Great traction when new but the shoe is a little narrow which can lead to rolling your ankle. I would also like a little more cushioning to protect joints during hikes/runs.<br />3) Durability = 3 Stars.  The soles simply wear out too fast. If you walk or run on any kind of pavement you can literally watch the soles wear after each outing. I understand this shoe is meant for trails but many people will occasionally wear them on a paved surface which will quickly lead to tread wear.<br />So overall I would rate these shoes 4 Stars.	2015-08-12

Wonderful shoes, had a number of medium price and expensive (on sale) shoes including the Danish Ecco, but kept wearing them down on the outside. Most of these, almost every one, could not have the heel repaired. Drove home to Toronto and bought a pair of these at the Hudson's Bay store in London Ontario (I was driving from Tulsa). Wanted shoes I could waterproof as I had no boots for the expected high snow. Shoveled high snow in my sister-in-law's driveway for two or three hours. Water did not penetrate. Got back home and decide to spruce up these shoes with polish and thought, they look pretty good. This was about 2010-11. Have been using them ever since, for yard work now as I bought another pair from Amazon and wear them daily, even for events a little more formal than casual dress. I could shine up the yard shoes and wear them if I wanted too.<br />Just excellent.	2015-08-12

The only small complaint that I have is that then I'm doing some of the exercises in a cardio class that I take my heel sometimes feels like it's slipping out of the shoe.  I think because of the awesome cushioning that is in the shoe your foot doesn't go as far down in the shoe as it does in a &#34;normal&#34; tennis shoe.  I checked that you can wear them comfortably for a couple of hours because I only use them to exercise in.  They are VERY comfortable shoes that I think you would be able to wear all day with no problem.	2015-08-12

These boots are definitely good quality and might be perfect for outdoor activities like hiking and whatnot, but they're too much for casual winter wear, which is what I bought them for. The soles are SO stiff, you can't bend your foot when you walk or go up steps, etc. I don't know how these are appropriate for anything, because they make you walk like Frankenstein.

I was buying cheap sandals for years from places like H&M or Target and while the cheap ones are always super cute, my feet hurt a lot after a day of wearing them. I decided to spend a little more on sandals and while these were a little pricey, I still think it was worth it. The cushioning in the shoe really makes a difference - after wearing these sandals for an entire day, my feet still hurt a little, but much less than with my old sandals. When I took these off after wearing them for a couple hours and I tried on my other sandals and flats, it was really noticeable how much more comfortable these sandals are! They don't offer much support, just more cushioning that most sandals and flats I have while looking just as cute.	2015-08-12

Who knows, maybe the boot varies a lot and that leads to all these conflicting reports about how it fits. I'm betting it has more to do with the fact that women sometimes blame the clothes for not fitting them, without explaining how their (highly individual) body measurements may have had something to do with the fit. I'm 5'2&#34;, 130 pounds (I have a small waist and carry most of my weight in T&a but I have shapely/average calves), and while my foot is technically a 5.5 wide, I can usually get away with a 6 regular. I took a chance on this boot, and I regret it.  The toe box pinches. Not a big problem, it's a leather boot and there are ways to fix that. Don't expect them to fit out of the box, though.  The real problem is that my legs rattle around in the shaft of this boot like the clapper in a bell, and that's harder to fix. I have to stuff my jeans and wear wool socks, and the end result is still unflattering because it makes my legs look shorter and chubbier than they are. I'm simultaneously not tall enough, not skinny enough, and not heavy enough to make these work.  Shipping for returns doesn't make it worth my while to return the boots, so I'll try and sell them for at least what I paid for them and keep trying.	2015-08-12

They fit right into my boyfriends shoes like a glove. It was wonderful. We are worried that they wouldn't fit but they worked out great. His feet are extremely flat and he has so many problems with them. He wears a 14 6E. Yes, a 14 size and his with is a 6E the largest you can get. So, we got it in the larger size. Needless to say he works on his feet as an arborist and it is very important he is comfortable while he works and has good support. He is on his feet 14 hours a day without a break. He used them and it worked perfectly. He told me right away he liked them and can tell there was great arch support. For very flat feet this worked very well. They do give a little height as well so if you are tall it will raise you up a bit. He is already 6'5'' so he said he didn't need to be any taller but it was not bad at all. They are not super soft and plush but they are comforting and give the right amount of support. They have a slight spring to them when you walk so you will get a little boost in your step. He was amazed they actually came in his size to begin with and he would recommend them as he is very happy so they get my seal of approval. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and true findings.	2015-08-12

I love the way these looked the moment I opened the box.  I purchased the Transparent Red version of the glasses.  The arms are attached to the frames with screws, not pins, and are about 5 inches in length.  The nose pieces are a clear soft plastic and the temple tips are covered with black plastic to keep you from getting scratched.  If things get loose, or you lose a nosepad, you should be fine with average repair kit.  The frames are designed to comfortably fit the curve of your face.  Everything about these sunglasses scream classic aviator, and then you get to the lenses.<br /><br />Set inside the bright silver frame, the vibrant red lenses really stand out.  To me, the color very reminiscent of the red side of a pair of older style 3d glasses.  I've usually only seen this color of a lens, while shopping in the toy or party sections of my local store.  Fortunately, these aren't just toy sunglasses.  The non-polarized lenses are rated at absorbing 99% of the UVA and UVB spectrums, which are they ones they blame for premature aging and cataracts, among other things. You can wear these sunglasses without sacrificing look for protection.  Put these on, and see the world in a whole new view.  I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-12

Therefore I need something that is going to last and gives good arch support.  Now, I know that getting good arch support is at a premium these days so I was all prepared to have to go get arch support inserts.  I don't have to.  Surprisingly enough.  I wanted something 'fun' so I decided on these for their color.  yay.  Are these the best built hiking boots I have ever worn? No.  But I didn't pay $185.00 for them either.  Love the tread too...great hiking over rocks.  One thing to 'complain' about? The soles are a bit thin.  I can feel sharp rocks through the soles...but on the plus side.. I can feel the ground thru the soles too..so over rough terrain..that's a plus.  I really like these boots and would purchase them again.  NOTE&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;  these are NOT heavy duty.  These are...head up the trail for a day hike kind of boot where rocks, sticks and creeks are going to be part of the deal.  If you are going to go on an extreme trek over a few days.. these might not be what you would want as the soles are (in my opinion) a bit thin and your feet might be hurting at the end of day two.  Think heavy duty tennis shoes not steel toed hiking boots.  :)	2015-08-12

I am a fan of Asics for my regular workout shoes so I decided to give the trail runners a try based on a recommendation.

EXCELLENT shoe, just not a good match for my C width foot. Wanted to keep these but after trying out on carpet for 30 minutes, the top strap was uncomfortably tight. Surprisingly, the toe strap was extremely comfortable. The problem for me isn't the shoe; I just have a foot that is too wide for most medium width shoes and not quite wide enough for many 'wide' sizes. This shoe gives great arch support!	2015-08-12

These are fantastic shoes that look great and are easily wearable for hours without discomfort.

THE FIT<br />These boots do run a size too big, just as the other reviews stated. Thanks to the reviews, I ordered a size 9. I wear a size 9.5-10 .. regular (no letter  next to the letter) .. or B(M) as some other manufactures label their shoes. I put on a pair of thick, reinforced men's socks to try them on .. that is the ONLY reason they fit a little tight around my right foot, which is bigger than my left. I like how the point is not overwhelmingly long .. like some pointed shoes which cause you to trip and the toe to bend against the end of your toes. They do have a tap sound, but it's a solid low-base sound .. not like my other cowboy boots .. you can hear me walking from about 20 feet away with those on. I finally feel like I have a real pair of cowboy boots ..so far as look, feel, and craft are concerned.<br /><br />STYLE<br />As I stated in my title, I LOVE THESE BOOTS .. they are very pretty! They also have a professional, serious look to them as well. The boots look exactly like the picture, even down to the color!! The red on the toes looks darker than the picture inside, but outside in the sun it's exactly the same red .. that's just a little side info .. just in case one of the reasons you're considering buying them is because of the brightness of the red on the toes. That was one of my reasons. They came a day early. I am very excited to wear them with my outfit!! I immediately ran to the closet for a pair of socks and the top half of my outfit!! I am very tempted to order them in black/beige!	2015-08-12

My mom bought these shoes about two years ago and swears by them, telling everyone she knows about them and how comfortable they are. As a result, my sister-in-law bought a pair, and now she swears by them. She's a hairdresser who is on her feet all day, so she takes shoes pretty seriously. So, I thought I'd look for them on Amazon to get the best price and found them to be VERY reasonable (as compared to the retail price you'll find elsewhere). They're cute and they're comfortable, they fit well, and they are made well. These are shoes that will be a staple in my wardrobe. Perfect to wear with jeans or shirts, or even a skirt.

Is there a limit to how many purse a girl can own (and shoes)? Answer is No. Ask any girl  This purse is simply beautiful and comes with a makeup bag and a small change and cell phone purse. All these three purses has same print and color I ordered this in beige color and it is very soft and bit shiny. The main purse is nice medium size purse with two sub compartments and a small zippered compartment in the middle. I love that the makeup bag comes with the purse as it is has the same pattern as the main purse but at the same time can be removed and transferred to any purse or backpack.  Along with the bag, you will also receive a small bag of potpourri, clips, extra straps and a cute butterfly charm.  Overall a complete package.  Sample received from the seller for use. All opinions are mine.	2015-08-12

I bought these boots for the looks mostly, so I'm very satisfied. Winters in southeastern VA aren't too harsh, but I wanted something to keep my feet protected and dry for the occasional winter conditions we experience. There is virtually no cushion in the footbed. I threw in a pair of Dr. Scholl's inserts, and they now fit like a glove and have better cushion and more arch support . Oh, and the laces did break before the boots were broken in. So there's that.	2015-08-12

Weirdness with these abound! So these would have been really nice if it had not been too small for my foot due to the smallish space from the back to the thong(the part that goes between your toes). I had never encountered that issue before and I can say that i MIGHT have gotten a bunk pair cuz one measures 8 in from back to thong and the other measured 8 1/4 in which for shoes is a serious difference...YET they were labeled both a 9...A little odd.	2015-08-12

They fit beautifully! They are incredibly comfortable, not too much of a lift, or too much of an arch. I have never loved a shoe better.

They are barely bigger than a 7. So I would almost be tempted to see what a size 9 would look like. But I know kids can get to that in between size where the smaller and larger size will not quite be right, but any bigger or smaller wont fit at all. I know some of you can relate to that.<br /><br />Either way this is a very nice quality shoe! And very good looking. I think my son is definitely going to be a Puma wearer from now on..	2015-08-12

They have been the only brand I've worn for years. Unfortunately they seemed to have changed quite a bit since the last pair I purchased. The quality is not quite as good as it used to be. I tried this pair because some of the reviews said they provide good support. I don't think they have enough arch support for a running shoe. Also, I don't think they would have lasted as long as the other pairs I've had. I returned these, and then went to a department store to try on other pairs. In the end I purchased a New Balance running shoe, which actually cost more than the Nike's I tried, but the support was really good.	2015-08-12

I bought a medium width because it appeared the shoe doesn't come in narrow - Goodness, half the shoes I own are narrow but this shoe I could barely get my foot into.  One change I would probably make - it has some white/off white stitching - hard to keep that stitching clean I suspect - I would have preferred a matching stitching so the shoe could stay fresh looking as long as possible.  Closed toe is nice when you don't want to deal with a pedicure.	2015-08-12

These sandals are well made and the leather is really soft and comfortable.<br /><br />I ended up returning them only because of how the front strap catches my little toe. The strap just a little too far forward, so as you walk, the outside edge kept catching my little toe or sliding between the little and second toe in. Which was really uncomfortable. This may be entirely a fit issue and your feet won't have this issue.<br /><br />If not for that issue, I would have loved the sandals, the are really nice looking and comfortable.	2015-08-12

Sketchers are usually a bit narrow for me, and these slippers are no exception. That said, I don't mind a nice snug slipper, but there are a few other reasons I wasn't thrilled with these.<br />Pros:<br />- expensive look and feel of the outer leather and sole<br />- could easily be passed off as shoes with the right pair of jeans<br />- tall platform sole means more insulation from the cold floor and a bit of height, much appreciated if you're short like me<br />- no annoying part behind the heel<br />Cons:<br />- memory foam? perhaps... but these do not have the comfort and support usually associated with that description<br />- gigantic hard sole means indoor wear is limited to walking around; these seem better suited to the outdoors than curling up on the couch<br />- there's a nice big scratchy tag sewn in right where the heel sits<br />- the faux fur is a bit long and uncomfortably itchy inside the slipper, and always finds its way between my toes; yes it's warm, but it feels plastic-y and annoying (if you have a narrow foot, socks are recommended)<br /><br />These will be kept by the back door for short trips outside during cold weather, but with limited comfort and indoor usefulness, these are overall quite a disappointment.	2015-08-12

The USPS accidentally rerouted my lenses 2500 miles away so they could take a tour of the US before coming to me. When I contacted Revant, they were quick to respond and offered to send out another pair if I needed the lenses more quickly. Dealt with two people who were both super friendly and made me a loyal customer.	2015-08-12

So I's say that is the only reason mine looks terrible (even though I took an excellent care of them!) and broke! Anyways, they are not fake, neither one of them. Coach is NY brand and  everything they make is made in China! Anyway, I took my old glasses to the shop so they can put my lenses into new frames and they did within seconds free of charge! Although, it was some local eyewear shop. LensCrafters did not dp it, becausr they were afraid😝. So instead of new eyewear at LensCrafters for about 400$ I've spent 80$ and guess what?

I also think the leather thong would be prone to stretching, as others have written in their reviews.	2015-08-12

I walk dogs, and have collected a lot of &#34;comfort&#34; shoes in red to go with my business color. Last year I broke my leg and the hospital cut off my Keen Venice H2 that I was wearing for the first time, and that color has been discontinued(!) I was tired of Keens but can't find shoes as good other than Ahnus that fit my foot and support a lot of walking. I got these Allrounder Niro mesh-style on sale, and expected that at least they would have the foundation of an average gym shoe. The upper is perfectly nice, but if you do buy them, you will need to replace the paper-thin insoles with something that costs as much as another pair of shoes. The insole needs to provide all the cushioning/shock absorption you won't have, heel cups for stability and an arch support. I didn't get these through Amazon, but they sure seem like a knock-off, or Mephisto's reputation is over.	2015-08-12

With the suede, the boot is all-around lighter, which makes it high quality for medium or light duty activity.  Within the first week, the side holes &#34;ports&#34; were damaged of their screen, while running in the woods. One recently ripped out, not sure why. When you first put them on, you'll be amazed. I have high arches and immediately felt comfortable. Very small break in period as I became accustomed to the boot height.  I was afraid of getting them wet at first, but discovered they held up well I everything below the top of the toe. Water above would get in the boot, but eventually dry out. Water also affects its bright color and makes it dark, even after drying.  I get compliments on my boots all the time. They are awesome, but some minor issues need attention before they can get 5 out of 5 from me. I will definitely buy another pair soon.  Update: It has been 13 months since purchase and the eyelets are just starting to fail at the tops of the boots. I've worn these boots nearly everyday since purchase. They've stood up well for being a light weight boot. I'll be buying another pair shortly, but will keep wearing these until they are nothing but dust.	2015-08-12

Other wise i might how just passed worring its to small for me.

I transitioned from the Merrell Ascend Glove and further back than that, the Trail Glove. The Virrata is the exact shoe I was looking for. I love the zero drop, and that is all I need. I want proper running form, but I don't need to be &#34;feeling the road.&#34; That part of running is overrated. The Merrell gloves are nice, but these are better. The cushion is enough for me to run further without feeling really much of any pain and they are extremely light.

This is the second Cocoons product I've bought. I love the first that I purchased about a year ago: Aviator style, tortoiseshell frames. Before purchasing both products, I checked the Cocoons site and carefully followed the sizing instructions, but this MX Rectangular frame fits a bit too tightly over my regular glasses frames. Furthermore, the plain black MX frames look and feel very cheap. I do not know whether this is due to a decline in quality or whether their black frames have always differed from the tortoiseshell. The next time I'm in the market for another pair of fit-overs, I won't buy black Cocoons.	2015-08-12

I've been looking for this design everywhere and they're so much cuter than those super tight ones they sell at journeys or DSW. And super affordable! My sister had hers for 3 years and they're still perfect. The only con is, while they do have adjustable straps, they're a little baggy in the top. The foot part fits exactly, but the straps near the calf are a little baggy, so people with narrow calves might not like it.	2015-08-12

I first ordered size 13 (size 49 Euro - which is a little larger than standard shoe sizing for US 13). Upon receiving them, I noticed they fit like a size 12 US. I looked and found the sticker on the sandal said size 46 Euro, which is smaller than standard shoe sizing for US 13. Amazon seamlessly returned the sandals at their expense, and had my new pair of size 14 US (which fit exactly like 13's) at my doorstep within two days!<br /><br />That being said, what about the quality? Well, I couldn't be more pleased. I purchased these as an alternative to the typical $30-40 leather/fabric sandals I buy and wear out within a few months. I was hoping they would be something that would last longer than one year.<br /><br />  The leather is obviously durable, and the stitching appears to be of a very high quality. Time will tell, of course, but first impressions place these sandals in a much higher quality tier than your typical shoe store options. The arch support is fantastic and the sandal seems to somewhat wrap around the edge of my foot very comfortably. The rubber sole looks like it will have a lot of life before wearing out. They are a bit narrow for me, but I do have wide feet. The only difference I might note (not really a complaint), is that they are a much more firm sandal than typical store-bought options. Within a few days, I'm noticing that they are breaking in and forming to the shape of my foot ever so slightly, making them more comfortable each time I wear them! Even though they are firm, I do not seem to have any trouble wearing them for long hours without discomfort. They seem like they will continue to grow in comfort as they wear.<br /><br />  I purchased the Otter color, and am very pleased with the design. The color is a good bit darker brown than the photo, but I also anticipate natural fading/wear in the leather over time.<br /><br /> Overall, I highly recommend this product! The Chaco brand was referred to me by a friend, and it sure made a believer out of me! I anticipate years of use from this product, not months - you won't be disappointed ;)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KXD998S Chaco Men's Cabrera Flip Sandal, Otter, 13 M US]]	2015-08-12

I wear these things at the pools, at the house and lounging around on vacations at the resorts. After wearing them for a long period of time (~6 hrs) i get a little bit of a rub right above my pinky toe. I haven't tried to do much about it.

The price of these shoes is astoundingly low.  Do they know they're giving their product away?Come to think of it, maybe I should buy a few more of these and THEN alert them to what's going on.  Hopefully they won't read this.<br />I ordered the black version for $19.99 and held my breath to receive it - thinking it was going to be awful.  It is soooo not.  I still cannot understand how this quality can be sold at these prices.<br /><br />Fit & comfort<br />Exactly as expected.  I ordered size 11 and it fit exactly as all my other size 11s.  For comfort, lets remember that this is an oxford.  It does have firm areas which give its shape and rigidity.  For those buying this as an upgrade from loafers you will find it more firm (as you would for any quality oxford).  But for office-types like myself who are accustomed to wearing oxfords this shoe will be fine for all day wear.<br /><br />Build quality<br />The leather lining is supple and rich.  I uploaded a photo which I hope conveys how rich.  The insole is deep and cushy.  The outsole is smooth and true.  The tooling and overall finish are top notch.<br /><br />Sole<br />I see a number of reviews arguing whether the sole is or isn't leather.  I am now satisfied that it is NOT leather.  It is a very dense, very thick synthetic rubber that I suspect will wear very well over time.  It is extremely hard and I can see how, even some purchasers, could mistake it for leather, but it isn't.  Again, that's not an issue for me.  I believe it will hold up well over the years.<br /><br />Color<br />One thing to point out that you won't see from the pictures:  These shoes are not completely black!!  It is a deep grey, maybe slate.  Only the heel and toe are fully black.  But, as in the pictures on Amazon this can definitely pass as black.  It's not an issue for me - it's actually a bonus for me as it gives me options.  It makes the shoe slightly different from my other black shoes.  Note that the difference in shade is only very slight - definitely not a two-tone - merely a very deep grey misted with black at the heel and toes.  Beautiful effect!!  I imagine if you wanted it all black then dye or shoe polish would be an easy solution - but it's fine for me.  In fact, I think I'll use neutral polish (rather than black) in order to keep the effect.  Most of your shoe's admirers won't even notice it - and believe me you will have plenty of admirers when wearing these.<br /><br />Value<br />It is a bit crazy to be commenting on value after owning this shoe for such a short period.  So I admit that I cannot speak about durability but the build quality, style and finish place the value of this shoe in the $90-$120 range.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Awesome purchase!  Don't hesitate.te that the difference in shade is only very slight - definitely not a two-tone - merely a very deep grey misted with black at the heel and toes.  Beautiful effect!!

These are more comfortable than the prior version, however the outer material doesn't seem to be of the same quality; seems a bit more styrofoam-like than faux-suede, but unless you're closely examining the shoe, it's a bit hard to tell.  The one problem this shoe has in common with the prior version is also that the insole/sock liner is glued into the shoe, so if you have orthotics, you'll have to tediously rip out the liner, which comes off in chunks, rather than one piece.  Still, it's a great slip-on shoe for quick entry/exits if you're frequently going out and don't want to be bothered with laces (if you don't wear shoes inside your home).  UPDATE:  I previously rated this as 4 stars, but have changed it to 2 stars.  The prior version of the shoe was more durable, lasted longer and held up better. This updated version seemed to start disintegrating after about five months of by no means heavy use, only to do errands/shopping.  The upper material is not of the same quality and began to look really rough.  The tread on the soles wore down to almost nothing.  It's a shame they didn't last as long as the prior version did, and the older ones were more heavily used.	2015-08-12

For years I've heard how much polarized sunglasses can help and I decided to finally bite the bullet.<br /><br />The amount of glare that these sunglasses cuts is phenomenal. I live in Southern USA and it gets bright down here sometimes. I'm now able to see the road when I'm driving so much better than I could with my old sunglasses, and this is important to me as I usually have my little boys in the car with me.<br /><br />The size and look of these is also fabulous. I love big sunglasses and these actually make me feel confident when I'm wearing them. They look like they're a lot more expensive than they are so you can look stylish and save a little money too.<br /><br />Let's just say that I'm going to be a lot more careful with these than I have with my past sunglasses!!<br /><br />**I received the Coleman Oversized and Vintage Women's Polarized Sunglasses for a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own and no further compensation was received.	2015-08-12

These look, thinner? More like a lighter weight runner's shoe. Some people might like a lighter shoe, but not me.  When it comes to my son I buy skechers Bc they are solid with a thick rubber.

This is a great bag and a great value for the money.  The quality is much better than you would expect for this price and the construction is really sturdy.

These shoes are absolutely gorgeous! I planned to wear them for a formal wedding in Texas. Tried them on as soon as they arrived in shipping. They were snug, but I could walk around the house and I was quite excited because they're so sparkly! Packed them in my suitcase, flew to Texas. Once I got to my hotel, I found that my feet had swollen a bit with flying, but then when I tried the shoes on, I couldn't even get my feet into them at all. I even slept in a cold room with my feet propped up all night. No luck. All of my other shoes still fit. For the wedding, I had to race out and buy another pair of shoes...same size, definitely not as beautiful. I tried the shoes back on when I got back home, but they STILL don't fit. It sounds strange, but I wonder if they shrunk during my flight. Anyway, my word of warning is buy the next size up...especially in the summer.	2015-08-12

The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is the lack of arch support.  I'd go so far as to day they have absolutely none.  They are extraordinarily comfortable, however, if arch support isn't a huge issue for you.  I went on a 4 mile walk on the beach just this past weekend in these and never felt uncomfortable.  The overall fit is typical KEEN: that's to say, wide in the forefoot and true to length.  Overall, I'd recommend them.	2015-08-12

My only complaint is that the upper material is a non-porous vinyl product which doesn't allow your foot to breathe. That's certainly not a deal breaker but it is an issue for my feet. I've owned a pair of Nike Mercurials for a year that are a combination of synthetic and leather uppers that is porous, breathes nicely and they seem to be made much better. I'll be curious to see how the F10s hold up over time.<br />If you're considering the F10s you might also want to look at the slightly more expensive Nike Mercurials.	2015-08-12

I have loved Sanuk yoga mat flip flops for a couple years now and have several pairs. Got these out of the box while I was actually wearing a pair of my flat/original sanuk yoga mat flip flops. They came out of the box looking really tiny - like a little girl's play dress-up shoes! I could already tell that they were way narrow, and way short. They have a whole different skinnier, curvier, slantier footbed shape than any of my other sanuk shoes - all size 8, as was this new pair I ordered. In a fitted shoe, I am a true 7.5M, but in these whole-size flip-flops, I've ordered all 8's. Just out of curiosity, I held these shoes sole-to-sole with the sanuks I was wearing. They are more than an inch narrower the whole way from the heel thru the arch, and 7/8 inch shorter in the length. The front of the shoe is less rounded and more sharply slanted across the toe area. I tried to put my feet in them (and DID), but they were neither comfortable NOR attractive. My feet looked like those of Cinderella's huge stepsister -- wedged in and spilling out of the glass slippers. SUCH a bummer. Will return... Given the shape of these, not even another whole size up would help. I'm sticking with the yoga mat flat flops. (Photo taken with both soles aligned on the inside.)	2015-08-12

The thing I didn't like about these was the texture inside (rough and bumpy) but if you wear socks, you can't feel it. It feels like you're walking on air in these. They cured my Plantar Facscitis. Idk how to spell that condition, but it's a painful foot condition that kept me from walking much for months. A week after wearing nothing but crocs flats, it was cured!	2015-08-12

I could have definitely gone a size down from my usual 7, though, and they are quite large in the calf for me (mine are 13.5 inches). There is a bit of a weird bump where they get bigger into the calf, but since they are so thick they stay up well and look pretty good. A bit wide for me too, and they rub in the heel, but I think getting half a size down would have sorted that out. Thick socks, and these will be great winter boots.	2015-08-12

The 10 is by far the worst out off all of them.  The shoe is so stripped down it feels like I'm running barefoot, and the balls of my feet are on fire after two miles.  The stack height on the shoe, both forefoot and heel, is reduced from the 9.  The 9 had just barely enough forefoot cushion to get by for 1/2 marys (but no more), but these are just totally useless for anything more than running to the end of the driveway to get the mail.  I don't think I've ever been angry after running in a shoe before but Mizuno has screwed this one up.	2015-08-12

I love these sandals!  They don't have a clunky look to them, yet they are so comfortable and the platform is the right height, making the heel not feel as high as it really is.  I gave them five stars because they are, hands down, the best shoes I have ever bought!  Normally, as sandals get worn, they start to separate from the sole.  But these sandals do not; they are well made!  The only problem I have found with these sandals is one day I was walking through some shallow puddles, and ever since then, they make a squishing sound when I walk.  This is very disappointing because I love these sandals.  So although they still look great, I don't like the squishing noise, so I will buy a new pair.  But I definitely recommend these shoes; just don't walk in puddles; otherwise you might get that same squishy noise.	2015-08-12

My daughter loves vintage clothing and vintage style accessories. This bag works beautifully as a cross-the-chest, messenger bag with a vintage flair. She fell in love with it as soon as she saw it.  It has a surprising amount of room in it. The top-zippered main compartment is large enough for a tablet, a book, a wallet and more. It has an interior zippered compartment and two additional pockets. The back of the tote has a small zippered pocket that is great for a smartphone. The front of the tote has a lift flag that reveals another good size pocket. There is also another zippered pocket under the flap that will fit a smartphone or smaller wallet.  The tote is well made with even, secure stitches. The leather accents add a touch of class. The zippers are high quality and work perfectly. My daughter say she wishes that the strap was leather as it would then match the buckle, but the current strap is sturdy and still looks nice.	2015-08-12

I wear a 6 1/2 and debated whether to get the 6 or 7 since they only come in full sizes.

They are comfortable and have the best arch support I've ever had in a sandal.  I have high arches and would have liked to have had even more support, but after wearing them for a week in Costa Rica (they held up well in heavy rain and lots of time at the beach) I was able to put on my athletic shoes with custom orthotics and felt fine.

I have three toddler girls and they are so perfect for my little ones to learn to put on their shoes and easily slip them on when they go outside to play. We do not wear shoes in the house and it is easy for them to slip off as well. It stays well on their little feet and the straps are soft on their heels. It is just so perfect for little feet by protecting their toes much better then flip flops.  I have bought 6 pairs already and will be buying more as they outgrow each size. I recently purchased the purple and pink crocbands and they are so adorable. I love all the cute colors and variety of crocs available. I could not race enough about this product.	2015-08-12

I have concerns over the pull cord eventually breaking and wonder if the shoes will become unusable if it breaks.<br />Fit - 4/5 stars - Comfortable all day long with no blistering or chafing. Adjustable pull cord works well to secure shoes to your feet, but can get annoying since it swings around and occasionally goes under feet when walking.<br />Traction - 1/5 stars - On wet surfaces these shoes make you feel like you're walking on ice. They're fine on dry land, but avoid these if you plan to be walking on anything smooth and wet outside of water.<br /><br />Overall I'd probably be inclined to look to Speedo or another brand without the pull cord and with better grip. As others have mentioned, these are definitely not shoes I'd wear hiking, surfing, or running.	2015-08-12

I thought I would come on here to let everyone know that it does fit! My phone is in a clear plastic casing, and it fits inside the purse perfectly at a little angle. There is room to spare for a lipstick and a little money and ID or whatever. That's about it. I am an adult, so I was afraid this might just be more of a purse for a high school prom or something, but it is fine for the evening wedding I am going to. It is not a Chanel or anything, but I am satisfied and happy with the purchase of this clutch considering the low price.	2015-08-12

Initially I had a hard time getting the got just right, but they have now loosened and conformed better to my foot so I can just slide in and out with no problems. Until they were broken in they also cut into my heel uncomfortably. This is no longer a problem and may have just been fixed by finding the perfect spot to adjust the slider between the toes.<br /><br />I have used these sandals for everyday walking, running, and hiking trails. The bottom rubber had good grip, but on sloped surfaces and damp feet you slide sideways out of the shoe.<br /><br />After many miles of wear including rocky trails, salt water and river crossings the sole of the shoe is showing zero wear. One sandal is starting to separate the foot pad from the rubber, but I think I can easily fix this. The left side is showing no separation and I think the damage has been caused by a slightly bum leg making me catch and fold the front of the sandal under my foot occasionally.<br /><br />I have wide feet and am an experienced minimalist runner. Don't get this sandal is you want a soft cushy ride. This is basically a minimally padded chunk of tire rubber strapped to your foot. I can't compare this sandal to other similar hurache designs, but I'm happy enough with mine that I plan to buy another pair or two in case I can't buy replacements in the future.	2015-08-12

I've been buying Puma sport shoes, on and off, since I bought a pair of soccer shoes in 1959. I have a C width foot and they always fit perfectly.<br /><br />These &#34;sneakers&#34; could not fit me better. I bought them for driving shoes and they have a stiff, non-slip, sole which is ideal for that. They also have a rounded heel excellent for driving.The sole is fairly thin, has little cushioning, and very little tread pattern, so I don't know how useful they would be as all-purpose &#34;Sneakers&#34;<br /><br />The only con is the side could be cut a little lower under the ankles. They rub a bit on me. I deducted a star for that.<br /><br />3/22/16: I added back the star because the shoes have broken in and are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn (in 72 years)! However, I wore them one day walking on gravel paths and they were as sensitive (uncomfortable) as I suspected they'd be. For driving and walking on sidewalks they are superb.	2015-08-12

After a summer's worth of wear, I'm still happy.  For me, the fit is true-to-size and the toe box had adequate room. Unlike some others, I like the velcro strap - it's s much easier than buckles. The velcro still holds firm  after repeated use. As time went on, I began to wish it had a little bit more padding in the foot bed or that the sole was a little bit more shock absorbent...But that wasn't a deal breaker. In fact, I'm thinking about ordering another pair!	2015-08-12

I wish I could rate them 3.5. I love the classic look and they are similar to ray bans(in looks, not quality). I also love how they fold. However, I'm not a fan of the overall quality to be honest. They seem pretty fragile and loose. I'm worried every time i close them that they will snap in my hands. Ok overall. Could be better. I have however worn them much in the past few months with no problems and many compliments. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.<br /><br />Pros:<br />iconic look<br />Cool folding ability<br />Cloth cleaning case(would prefer hard case)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Flimsy<br />Screws need tightening<br />No hard case allows for easier chance at breaking<br />Worried at them snapping out of nowhere	2015-08-12

My wife ordered me to put them outside or in the garage. I looked up information on the internet about the issue. Apparently, these faux leathers produced in China (especially) have a terrible odor. Numerous web pages found on Google give direction on how to reduce the smell--none offered the possibility of complete removal. So far, I have used dishwashing soap, window cleaning spray, white vinegar mixed with water and wrapped them in newspaper with tissue wrapped charcoal placed inside the shoe. The odor persists. The last resort is to put them in a bag with charcoal (or Odoreaters) for two weeks. That's my next and last attempt. If I have no success, I will return them prior to deadline.	2015-08-12

Thought they were great when I first got them.  The color faded fast on them, but that didn't bother me since I wore them quite a bit to walk the dog in the rain.

Really practical, lots of room to throw in everything for a overnite stay or the beach etc. Need an organizer compartment to put inside if you want to find stuff easily. You can just fold in a tight log for a pair of pants, tees, underwear, socks etc. The material and stitching is 'superb'! Overall, I like this 'HOBO STYLED BAG'! It even has an outside zipper which was not shown and came as a surprise to me! It also has inside zip pocket, and 2 pockets for cell phone etc. although pockets are a bit shallow, I still find them useful.  I ordered 2 of these bags; one in dark tan and the other in brick red...the colors are on spot; brick red not too red or dark. The dark tan the same. Also, it is unisex styled ... so, I would recommend for either male or female and a MOST DEFINITE PLUS for students in college or school period.	2015-08-12

I always wear two pairs of socks when hiking, one thin next to my feet, and one cushy, thick woolen pair. This doesn't prevent blisters - I have still gotten them in other hiking shoes.

I love these shoes so much I even wear them to work at Coldstone when I have an extra long shift! The shoes look fine and are very lightweight. The price is great, shipping was quick.

I purchased these in the black croc style and they are perfect! The heel measures roughly 4.5 inches in height which gives this shoe a very classy look. This heel helps give my legs an elongated look and I get so many compliments when I wear them. These heels are actually really comfortable compared to other heels I've purchased in the past. They don't rub and they fit really nicely. Most of the time I have to break in new shoes but not with these. I wore them to work the day after I got them and had no issues at all. I'm new to the Riverberry brand but so far I'm very impressed. If all the shoes are like these I'll be a repeat customer for sure. Great quality at a great price. I purchased this product during a promotion at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-12

I've worn the Taghee before and been totally satisfied, however, the pair I just purchased seems markedly narrower than previous purchases. Overall it's an excellent shoe but they seem to be running narrower now, and the fact is that you really do need to order a half size larger, which I did.  In my mind it's a bit of a red flag when a company can't produce a shoe that's true to size. I've never experienced the quality failures many speak about with any KEEN shoes falling apart, but the sizing is an issue.  I have purchased a pair of KEEN Voyagers directly from KEEN and I will say that if you love KEEN's and sizing is of concern that is the shoe to buy. It offers a generous foot bed, 5 pair of lace up loops - Targhee only has 4 - it fits a bit higher on the ankle though it is truly a low cut hiking shoe and it is most certainly 'true to size'. The thing about the 5 pair of lace loops is that it provides better adjustment to allow wearing a variety of sock weights and properly support your foot.	2015-08-12

Anyway, LOVE it and am so glad I did buy it. I will be seeing what else they have. Great quality, great room, super soft - will last and look great for years! Get it!! **One thing about the colour 'white' - so hard to find a 'white' to match your clothes. This bag did not look dingy next to a bright true white and next to whites that had a yellow/tan or hint of grey, it blended well. Good luck!	2015-08-12

The soles are fantastic and feel very cushioney and comfortable!  However, I have somewhat of a large instep and the band that goes around that part of my foot was too tight.

I would have also kept them in hopes that they would stretch because in all honesty they were just a little snug, I could get them on, but because the top is man made and not leather, it's not even worth it.  It's a shame I will have to return them, because even with the man made material...had they fit, I could tell they would be very comfortable.  But nothing beats real leather!	2015-08-12

These are exactly what I wanted for for my first one or two retirement cruises.  I got the black and the grey and they fit perfectly and stretch just enough to stay on and feel true to size. They make a nice substitute for sandals, if you don't have the prettiest feet.

The bag is quite a bit smaller than what the measurements online indicated (much like the review listed below, which was posted after I had already purchased the bag). Since I was hoping to use this as a bag for plane travel, I didn't think it would be much better than my current purse. I was also really bummed with the way the leather looked. I didn't love the color when I bought it, but I thought it would work, however, it is very shiny and made the whole thing look really cheap. I really wanted to love this bag, but I just didn't, so back to Amazon it went.	2015-08-12

I wear size 9.5 shoe and ordered these in size 9 and they were still way to big.  I added insoles and two pairs if thick socks just to make them fit.  So I returned the size nine and got an 8.5 and they fit pretty good, but I still had to add insoles.  They are comfortable enough and look really stylish.  I can tuck jeans inside w/o any problems.  Im 5'8&#34; 134lbs with average size calves.  My husband has caterpillar boots too and had to buy one full size smaller as well.<br /><br />Edit:  After owning these a whole season, I still love the way they look.  However, I think they are still too big and wish I had gone down to an 8.  Thats kind of crazy, since I wear a 9.5!  I find that walking in them takes a little too much concentration because of their clunkiness.  But I totally love the way they look!  They dont hurt my feet, but I do get tired legs from the extra effort it takes to walk in them.  So they sit in my closet a little more than I would like them to.	2015-08-12

It took me a while to write this review and in fact the only reason I am writing it is because there were no reviews when I made my purchase. The seller has to be commended for their packing style and delivery speed; I received the shoes in a matter of days and I didn't have to grit my teeth whilst ripping through wasteful or inappropriate packaging.  I own a lot of shoes and grew up wearing Addidas - the shoes were always well constructed and the fit and comfort were a runner's dream but the color choices were lacking so I switched to Oasics. Oasics are also great but for persons with narrow-er feet and not necessarily narrow feet. However, I strongly believe that Addidas are still better for me and I've experimented with a great number of brands, regardless of cost for the goal of 'fit'.  I was pleasantly surprised with these shoes. The quality has not changed thankfully and these shoes feel like walking on clouds. My only complaint is about the sizing. I normally wear a 9.5(B)M and this is shoe is quite unforgiving because of the stretch-like fabric which is good for ventilation but quickly shows that I should have ordered a half size bigger. So for those of you looking for a new shoe, this is it but be sure to order a half size up.	2015-08-12

I ordered the wide size and, for a wide it's, well, not.  They will break-in a little wider, but out of the box, it feels only marginally wider than a medium.  Since it's basically impossible to find this in the stores, I tried other brands before buying this.  The Moab Ventilator from Merrell, for example, has enough room to fit a small army in.  I own a pair of Timberland White Ledge in non-wide and these are only marginally wider than the White Ledges.  It's not enough to make me want to return them, but I wish the wide was definitely a little wider.  Outside of that exception, it's one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've ever worn.  It is super comfortable on the bottom of my feet.  The shoe is high-quality and very stylish as well.  I definitely recommend these, but if you have really wide feet, you may want to consider the Moab Ventilators - though they are lower quality and frankly really ugly.  There is also a version of these same shoes with Gore-Tex if you want the waterproofing - though there are complaints on Amazon's listing of those being really narrow, perhaps more so than these are.  The Gore-Tex version is more money than these.	2015-08-12

I haven't had a chance to wear them in harsher weather but some things to note for future buyers: this is less of a &#34;black&#34; combat boot and more of a very, very dark grey. The difference is hardly noticeable, and I actually prefer it so it's not as harsh - the material on the outside is also a lot softer than I expected. The interior is lined with a furry/shearling-like material which definitely makes this a warm boot. I don't expect these to last longer than 2 Fall/Winter seasons in Seattle weather, and would not recommend this as a durable winter boot. BUT, it is still very comfortable and I think if you're interested in buying a combat boot to try, this would be a good place to start.	2015-08-12

I am giving them five stars because of the boot itself. not my poor sizing choice. I got the correct size from the red wing store and they are the best pair of boots i have ever owned. hands down. The only thing to be weary of is the sizing. Its jank. I wear a size 11 in vans classics and 11 1/5 in nike frees and I eventually ended up with a size 10 in these. TEN. They fit perfectly. If I put them up to my roommates size 11 justin boots they are the same length. crazy. here are a few tips to consider when buying iron rangers:<br />1: assume the red wing salesmen is an idiot and has never put a pair of shoes on in his life. from what I've gathered and from personal experience they always size you way larger than you need. Do not be afraid to ask for three or four different sizes to try on. no matter how dumb of a look he gives you. you are shelling out three hundo on some leather. be damn sure its right.<br />2: they are supposed to be tight when you are first wearing them. don't worry about that. the tongue fold pressed so hard on the top of my foot when I first wore them out of the store that I had a bruise. 2 days later it was totally bearable and a week later it was non existent. in short, these cow sacks stretch. and its awesome.<br />3: to break them in quicker take your boot and massage and move the portion of leather that is the tightest a good bit. you will notice it will significantly soften the leather.<br />4: after buying, lace up, pimp walk, find babes.	2015-08-12

I wear 7.5 or 8, and I got it in 8 because the straps can be tightened, and in the summer which is when I wear them my feet tend to swell and I tend to walk a lot. It worked out so well.<br />it is now my summer staple, I don't go on any summer trips without this pair. If you're going in the water at some beach or creek, just pull the straps tighter so they're snug on your feet, and they double as water shoes. (Of course if in rocky water or big currents, you might want to protect your toes).<br />I've walked around in these for over 6 hours in a day and had no discomfort (if any then readjusting the straps did the trick) Would purchase again.	2015-08-12

I have several pairs of Mylahs in different colors, and they have a nice heel height that isn't too high but gives some lift and support. I have a wide foot and the normal width is comfortable for all day wear.

Lens and frame quality are very good. I always stick with polarized lenses on my sunglasses unless I'm looking for photochromatic types. The polarizing quality of Arnette lenses seems to be better than many brands I have tried. When Arnette says you are buying a wrap-around frame, be prepared for real wrap-around style. My favorite Arnette model has always been the Raven, but I thought I would give the Quickdraw a try. Glad I did. The fit for me is perfect. The sunglasses sit perfectly level on my face. This may sound weird to some, but I have experience with some sunglasses that just always feel like they are sitting crooked on my face. Drives me crazy with constant adjustments. Maybe my ears are crooked?  Peripheral vision is a bit obscured by the thickness of the frame, but this has not been an issue for me. They come with a nice case, lens cloth, and a fabric bag for storage. Recommended. Jimmy	2015-08-12

I LOVE the color and is the perfect size, even larger than I thought it was going to be. The bag arrived quickly and just as pictured. BUT....at first I thought I had been sent the wrong bag because I couldn't figure out how to adjust the stap to make it cross body. Also like another reviewer had said the strap is pretty stiff. My biggest problem though was that it has this horrible smell (almost a rubber-y smell, like tires!), I don't know where it could have come from. The bag is a legitimate  Vera Bradley (has tags attached) so it must be from how the shipper stored it or something along those lines as I've never had a Vera Bradley that smelled like this!! I'm hoping the smell goes away with with some nice smelling spray and fresh air.	2015-08-12

I'm used to buying running shoes.  Night and day difference.  However, these crossfit shoes are quite comfortable as general purpose gym shoes.  The fit is good (my foot is kind of narrow).  There is not as much lift at the heel as I have on my running shoes, which I think is a plus when doing squats and other leg exercises.  The foam on the sole seems sturdier, or maybe just a bit more firm than what I am accustomed to with running shoes.  I don't think I would take them out and run 5-10 miles, but given the cushioning that most of the treadmills at our gym provide, I have not had any issues with jogging 2-3 miles in these on the treadmill.  It's been quite a few years since buying a pair of Reebok shoes, but the build quality appears decent and hopefully these will hold up for some time.	2015-08-12

(Issue now CORRECTED)	***ORIGINAL REVIEW (8/11/2015)*** OK, this is going to be an interesting review..... So from the product itself, I love love love it. Cutest thing ever. We are frequent Cruise travelers, and this year we are blessed with a baby boy, so we got these specifically for that intention (for him to wear on the ship). So this is all wonderful and I have no regrets. The only reason I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 stars is because when this item arrived, I noticed the left shoe side is labelled &#34;6-9 month&#34; and the right side is labelled &#34;9-12 month&#34;. See pictures. Very bizzare. This is the first time ever happened to me. So I immediately took out my tape measure, and measured the length of the outsole, and they BOTH measured 4 7/8 inches, which confirms 9-12 months. Which kinda makes sense since when I look at them, they look exactly the same, and somewhat big for my baby right now.... So I think the labelling is just wrong, but the size is the same. So please please please, if you order this upon receiving it, DON'T assume the size is automatically correct, please check the size to make sure.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review. If you find this review helpful in any way at all, please click &#34;yes&#34; below (to find it helpful) to help me know what is helpful and keep at it. Thank you.  ***EDITED (8/12/2015)*** I was quite surprised, after I left my review yesterday, within hours the company reached out to me to apologize for their issue and that they want to make it up to me by sending me a replacement. This is superb customer service, especially with the fact that I did NOT reach out to them to inform I want my money back or replacement.... they did by themselves. Very satisfied, and changed my review now from 4 to 5 stars.	2015-08-12

I wear an 8 in the GoWalks but ordered a 9 based on reviews. An 8.5 would have been prefect.<br />These are cute and flattering. It's hard to find a sandal that is cut lower down to flatter the leg, more important in black.<br />I am not crazy about anything between my toes and generally avoid thong or toe ring styles.<br />I had some black adhesive ball-of-foot cushons I hoped would 1) pad the ball of foot for more comfort because this shoe has very little compared to most Skechers and 2) it would push my foot back for a better fit.<br />The pads really don't do much-might look for another pair and stack them, especially as the straps are stretching.<br />I do not think these are that comfortable. They are super lightweight but have very little padding in front.<br />My feet and legs hurt after 2-3 hrs of walking/shopping.<br />I do not wear heels.<br />I kept these because I needed this style, they are very flattering, are a reasonable wedge height, they don't make any noise like flipflops, they were a Lightning deal and they are lightweight.<br />I would not buy another pair of these.	2015-08-12

My main complaint though is traction on wet slippery surfaces (rocks eg that have moss on them)-buyer beware, these shoes are downright treacherous, they will slip as if the surface was made of ice, would definitely not recommend if you're likely to encounter these conditions, I have fallen a couple of times while running and had some hairy slips on wet rocks, not for the faint of heart that's for sure.

The wide leather piece was too wide for the length of my toes,  When I finally adjusted them they were pretty comfortable but after about 7 times of taking them on and off the buckle broke.  The metal piece that sticks into the leather to hold the strap in place broke off at some point, I never did find it or could I have fixed it even if I did.  I will have to bring it into a shoe repair place.	2015-08-12

Doesn't seem like you can tie the shoe tight enough to prevent blisters.

The sandals in particular are probably the most comfortable pair of flat shoes I own. Out-of-the-box comfort. How often does that happen? Fully adjustable, front, back, and upper loop, soft, incredibly cozy and fit for great long walks, which is exactly what I need them for. Normally I wear a size 6.5 and was able, with the help of a digitized advisor provided during purchase, to deduce that size 6 of this brand would fit me. Sure enough, it fit perfectly. I couldn't say enough good things about Propet. Also own a pair of their sneakers which are amazing as well.	2015-08-12

I work daily in work boots and really put them to the test. I had a previous pair of Danner boots that I loved more than any other. I had to get a new pair just to replace the ware and tear on the old ones. The soles are very thick but accommodating to my high arch. They have the extreme grip that my job requires. The shaft of the boots provides extra support to my ankles which make them good for hiking as well. Over all expect these to take a while to break in. One they do they are the most comfortable boot you'll ever wear. Once again Danner amazes me with their craftsmanship. Highly recommend!	2015-08-12

I must admit, I was quite impressed with this bag. Mine looked a tad bit different from the pictures in the listing. My zipper was not all black. It was gold. And there is a logo name on one side. See pics.<br /><br />Perfect sized bag for my 13&#34; macbook and files. The bag does not have feet so beware of putting it on the ground or &#34;dragging&#34; it. The straps are a nice length. It is long enough for me to wear on my shoulder and keep the bag tight against my body. Yet, short enough for me to hold it by the handles and walk with my arms down without dragging it on the floor. I'm 5'2&#34;.<br /><br />The outer zipper pocket is big enough to hold my iphone 6 plus with wallet case (standing up). It's a bit of a tight squeeze if I try to lay it down completely inside the pocket. Any other smaller phone would fit much easier.<br /><br />The interior has a nice lining that does not feel flimsy at all. There are multiple slip/open top pockets on both sides and one zippered pocket. It also has a nice long strap with lobster clip for holding your keys. I love this feature because I no longer have to dig for my keys as I walk to my car.<br /><br />The bag material is synthetic leather and you can tell at first sight. It has a grainy texture and even smells like plastic. This bag has is well finished. Meaning, the straps, the stitching, etc is well done for a non name brand purse. There are a few stray strands of brown strings that I could see on the inside from the lining, but other than that, the straps did not have fraying. The stitching was nice and tight and the pockets were well sewn.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this purse is its weight. It's VERY VERY light. I can't stand bags that weigh a lot when its empty. Add your stuff to it and you may as well skip the gym. I added pictures and everything you see in the one picture all fit inside the purse and I could zip it shut. Capacity is pretty good. The base/gusset is nice and wide.<br /><br />Personally, I would pay about $25 tops for this purse just because it is not real leather. But as far as usability, practicality, and quality goes, this is a decent purse for those who don't care about name brands or the smell of leather.<br /><br />My suggestions on how they can improve this purse:<br />Use a better zipper for the main compartment. The current zipper is a little sticky when opening and closing.<br />Add feet to the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for my honest review.<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/14/15<br />I've used this bag for less than a week on a daily basis. The gold nut that screws the strap onto the ring on the bag popped off. The pieces are not metal. They are painted to look like metal. Luckily it popped off when I was in my garage so I didn't lose that part. I managed to screw it back on and then made sure the other 3 were on tight. I'm a little worried now of putting my MacBook in here. So I only carry light things in the purse. I don't trust the straps anymore and don't want to risk destroying my computer.t real leather.

Very comfortable. I like the 3/4 top but probably needed a little better ankle support for the hike I was on (lots of big rocks on a mountain).  I really like the extra ankle support compared to a regular hiking shoe. I would say these are a good medium duty hiking shoe.  I normally wear a 9.5-10 depending on the shoe so I ordered the 9.5 based on other reviews that said this shoe runs large.  The toe was a little longer than normal but there is no way a 9 would have fit comfortable.  I've learned that having extra room in the toes is VERY important when hiking.  I would say they run just a little large.	2015-08-12

The heel is just the right height for dressy occasions that would require lots of standing or walking.  Also good with skirts, pants, and dresses.<br />The reason I removed two stars is that the right shoe is slightly larger than the left.  I've never had this issue before with a shoe, so I'm confident this is an issue with the manufacturing.  I had already worn the shoes all day by the time they got broken in, and at that point, my right shoe was slipping off with every step.  (Very annoying.)  I figured I could no longer return them since they were worn.  Since I really do love them, I ended up buying a $5 pair of FabFeet (back heel cushions) and now the right foot fits as well as the left.	2015-08-12

Lots of walking, including uphill and downhill, and never had a problem. Not even a hint of blisters on race day or days later.  I don't recommend walking miles on brand new shoes, but I got kinda motivated by the bike race event and got some terrific videos and pics.  The shoes never made me regret my decision.	2015-08-12

However, I am very disappointed with this sandal IN THE COCOA COLOR -- the leather used for the straps was very flimsy and stretchy.  The middle straps that criss-cross were too loose and bulged.  I exchanged the Cocoa sandals twice but the problem persisted.  Thanks to Amazon for exchanging the Cocoa pair twice for me - so disappointed the Cocoa didn't work out. FYI, I had also ordered the same sandal in the Stucco (off white) color and am very happy with them -- the leather is firm and the straps hug my feet comfortably.	2015-08-12

I normally wear barefoot tennis shoes (vivobarefoot) and I wanted something dressier to wear this summer without compromising the wonderful comfort of tennis shoes.  These sandals are awesome!  The sole is very cushy and comfy.  The wedge style is sturdy and feels almost like flats with the benefit of making my calves look much better in a skirt than flats.  The straps are comfy and do not dig in to my toes or ankle...no rubbing, no blisters.  The buckle design is brilliant and so easy to get on and off.  Unlike other reviewers, I think the buckle is very secure and I have no concerns about it coming undone.  The &#34;oat&#34; color is so versatile and exactly what I was hoping for.  It is a little bit heathered and goes great with grey, navy, brown, jeans, etc.  I have a fair skin tone and don't do much tanning in the summer and the oat color looks much better with my fair skin than a bright white shoe.  The only problem I have had with these shoes is that they are very slick on wet surfaces.  I stepped on a little water in front of a drink machine and almost fell, but I would still highly recommend them!	2015-08-12

It is a beautiful bag, but even after several months the leather smell is still pretty strong and I found it uncomfortable to carry.  The adjustable strap doesn't stay adjusted so it was always hanging too low and banging me in the side.  Even adjusted correctly it was still cumbersome.	2015-08-12

Besides me being excited for it arriving way earlier than expected..... I was surprised when I opened the box to see how gorgeous this bag is!! It's completely an Authentic Coach Bag. Has the serial numbers inside that Coach is famous for. The quality is soft and the smell is of that brand new Leather that we all love. I was wondering in the photos if this bag had any posts on the bottom to protect the surface when it's sitting on something... And it does! It's really cool because the shoulder straps are convertible... You can take them off or leave them on. Coach created this bag so that you can keep the shoulder straps on with them connected to a nice fit. And, the posts on the bottom of the bag are snaps so that you can secure the shoulder straps underneath the bag making an appearance that's very appealing to the eye. Thank you for such a great bag at a great price and for quick delivery!! I love it love it love it!!	2015-08-12

Most of us can't afford the high brand shoes because they're so expensive so I love this brand! The shoe quality is quite amazing! The heels are approximately 2.75 inches so they're not too high but also not too low. All the focus is on the front design of the shoes with golden studs on them and the pointed front. They're made of synthetic leather which looks sexy as heck! I got mine in size 10 (I'm US size 9) so I'd recommend you buy one size bigger so that it perfectly fits you. The heels are very sturdy and your balance remains intact when you walk in them so i love that! They're not uncomfortable at all AND they look gorgeous for such a reasonable price! What mire could I ask for?! They are perfect for parties or get togethers when you want to make a shoe statement. You can wear them with dresses, jeans etc. Show off your amazing style with these stunning heels, ladies!<br /><br />Sample provided without any obligations.	2015-08-12

Something about the design means that the strain isn't borne by the sides of my foot at the &#34;ball&#34; but rather by my toes mashing into the front of the shoe.

I like to review these Trainer's and this one is by far the worst DS Trainer I've bought on first usage.  I've tried most all of them since about 2 or 3 and been wearing (running in) DS Trainers exclusively since 2003.  Having said that, they are still an excellent shoe comparatively.  I've been running in my DS 18's and then in these so I have a great side by side comparison.<br />Cons: Small fit.  Tight toe box, which cramps the feet and takes awhile to break in.  Top material takes a long time to break in and feel like a 29.99 shoe from big 5.  Very aggressive heal compared to previous models. Tread pattern seems to allow for more slippage on dirt that the 18's.<br />Pros: Lighter than previous models.  Good cushions.  Normal DS Trainer feel.<br />Unknowns: Wear on sole (I only have about 25 miles and they look fine).  Break in comfort (still haven't completely broken in)<br />After getting these, I wish I would have skipped this model and gone with the 19's.	2015-08-12

I would've liked a tiny bit more room to grow into but that isn't the main concern.  For $30-50 ish dollarsv you really kind of her what you paid for.  The shoe is not hard at all it feels smooth and cheap.  The sole is the real issue if You walk a lot, or are a heel striker like me.  The sole will wear out quickly due to the material not to mention it looks like that cheap tan from the bottom.  In other words if they could've just jacked up the proce 10-25 dollars I wouldn't have cared as long as they fixed this.  They didn't even come in a box,  just styrofoam wrapped in plastic. In order words just buy this if you absolutely must have some dress shoes you'll probably wear seldomly.	2015-08-12

The runs typically are from about 4 to 8 miles in length, 4-5 times/week. Before these shoes my shoe of choice was the Adidas Energy Boost 2. When I initially ordered the shoes, I ordered the typical size that I wore in the Boost 2's.  However, when the shoes arrived, I tried them on, and they were way too long and especially too loose in the heel. I have a normal width foot, arch, etc. So, I returned the shoes and ordered a new pair, a half size down.<br />These shoes arrived and at a half size smaller than I normally wear, they fit much closer in style to my Boost 2's. However, they still feel a little loose in the heel and slip when I run up VERY steep hills. Also,  my front toes tend to go numb on me when I do longer than 5 mile runs, this does NOT happen with my Boost 2's.<br />Finally, the cushioning feels like there is more support but it is not as responsive as I had anticipated and on recent runs with the Ultras I have recently experienced foot pain in my heel and in my knee that I have not experienced in over a year.<br />Who knows? it could just be my foot size and shape, but for the difference in price the Boost 2's give me a much more satisfying ride and less painful experience than the Ultras. I really really wanted to like this shoe, especially after I paid 180.00 for it, but I think I am going to stick with what works for me: Boost 2. Maybe someone else with a different foot shape and not as many running injuries that I have experienced will be successful with this model. But, this just wasn't for me..... and I really really wanted the all white pair. sigh.	2015-08-12

Aside from getting blisters (as I always do with new shoes) these are great! Just don't wear them for a 4-mile walk while you're trying to break them in.

Now that he's wearing them almost daily, however, he seems to really like them. His preference is to wear them with socks rather than without. He says the plastic feels a little hard around the top of his foot and socks make that a non-issue. The strap around the back holds secures them nicely - he can run, walk, skip, etc. without them falling off of his feet or tripping him up. These shoes are ultra-sturdy and my son will most certainly outgrow them before they have a chance to fall apart. The light-up feature is an added bonus. Crocs are typically pricey and these are no exception, however, I feel that the quality of these shoes makes them money well-spent and I would both recommend and repurchase without hesitation.	2015-08-12

But, as other commenters have warned, they do run short in the length.

It functions well, craftsmanship is very high, and it is an excellent size.  It reminded me of the ones that the high end shoe stores use when helping you try on shoes.  It is certainly more expensive than a plastic one, but considering I will buy it once and likely have it for decades, I might as well &#34;splurge&#34; the extra few dollars.

It is the perfect size for me because I like bigger bags...but it isn't so big that people are going to think I'm carrying everything but the kitchen sink with me.  I can fit my wallet, make-up bag, tablet, phone and whatever else I need with no problem.  The heavy duty zipper works great and keeps everything secure inside.  It is made of high quality synthetic leather and really looks nice.  It is the perfect everyday bag for anyone.  It has structure to it so it has been easy for me to carry papers and a notebook as well.  If you have small kids you could even stash a couple of diapers, wipes and a bottle inside if you wanted to avoid carrying a diaper bag.  The inside is lined nicely and offers a total of 4 pockets and a key latch.  There is also a zippered pocket on the back outside of the bag.  This bag makes it easy to stay organized.  Impressed by the quality and how nice it looks.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.	2015-08-12

I always by a size 5 from this brand but for the first time ever they were too small. I'm having a hard time understanding how the size 5 could be THIRTY dollars less than the size 6.  I wanted to return and buy a size 6 (since I can't do a simple exchange), but I just can't justify paying twice as much for the same shoe from the same seller.  Looks like these will be a return only. I'm disappointed, but I guess this seller- like many others- prices based on size popularity.<br /><br />I still gave this shoe a 4 since if they had fit I would have given them a 5.  The design of the shoe is even better in person and the quality is inline with all the other Iron First heels I own.  As for comfort, these aren't really good for a whole day of wearing (unless you are used to wearing really tall, platformed heels) but great for a night out.	2015-08-12

Then the 9 - footbed too long and the top (between toes/ top of foot) was way too large. Giving these 5 stars because the shoe is great, but not a great fit for my foot.	2015-08-12

My toes kept sliding over the end of the shoe, although I ordered a size bigger. Then I remember that some people thought they were &#34;too big&#34;, others thought they were &#34;too small&#34;, yet there were those who said they were &#34;just right&#34;. So I thought about the 'goldilocks phenomenon' & how that could be & realized that shoes today only come in one width. Why isn't anyone talking about that? Maybe they did but I didn't see. My foot is somewhat narrow therefore slips forward & out of the shoe. I do not think this could be corrected with a larger size.<br /><br />Bottom line: When considering this shoe think about your foot width & how the fit might apply to you. The company would do well to try to solve this dilemma.	2015-08-12

I wanted to love these shoes - they seem so sturdy and well made, but since my son can't even get his foot into the shoe, it does not serve much purpose.  I bought a whole size larger than his current shoe size, and he still could not squeeze his foot into the shoe.  And no, he does not have wide feet.  The problem seems to be the bungie that squeezes the shoe.  No matter what I did, I could not widen the opening to slip his foot in.  Perhaps I don't know how to use these shoes (who knew that a shoe could have a learning curve) but I struggled for 20 minutes to loosen the ties and just couldn't do it.  They are going back and I canceled my order for a matching pair for my daughter.  Bummer.  I really hoped that these would work for him.  From a quality perspective, they looked great.	2015-08-12

They look very well made. I love that they have the flex-zy sole which is a hard but flexible sole, perfect for my new walkers. I love the colors and overall look of the shoes.

However, the look like they are on the wrong foot when looking down at them because the arch isn't indented much on the side. They also are right in the toe box even though they are the same length as my  Adidas wedge sneakers that fit comfortably. I'm not sure if a half size larger will fit better for this reason.   They are well crafted put of quality materials and the color selection is fun. I'm on the fence about these and will keep them for a few days to decide if I want v to keep them because the price here on Amazon is amazing.	2015-08-12

I live in a beach city, so I wear these all the time.  I ordered these because I was overpronating on one foot, and this corrected the problem.  Interestingly, it was my problem foot that took a couple of days to get used to having arch support.  My arch ached for about two days (because the sandals arch support actually worked and was correcting my problem), then I have had no pain.  Love these sandals; I will never go back to cheapo flip flops again.  Also, I am a woman with wide feet.  These fit perfectly and are true to size.	2015-08-12

They were very soft and comfortable immediately and didn't need a break-in, that's how awesome they were.  Kohl's no longer carries this line, so after mine finally broke down after a couple of years (worn alternating with other shoes, so a few times a week), I was happy to see them available on Amazon.<br /><br />The outside looks pretty much the same, perhaps with some minor differences, but the insole is very different and I found this newer version a bit hard to walk around in.  They seem to require a break-in period.  I wore them a few hours a day for a couple of days, but they've gotten gradually less comfortable throughout the day to where I couldn't wait to take them off.  I've not worn them in a couple of weeks, but will give them another try for short errands to help the break-in along.  They look good and feel good when first put on, but they are definitely more firm than the prior version I had.	2015-08-12

However, I just returned these due to quality problems: after wearing these only four times, I noticed the sole was beginning to separate from the boot.  The shoes were very nice (looking)—I am sad I had to return them.  Order on the smaller side.  I wear a US 8 and got a US 7; they were snug, but after breaking them in, I would imagine they would be nice (but mine didn't last long enough to break them in).

Help up WAY better than I initially thought they would, and I get compliments on them all the time! Love!  My original review below: Nice looking boots. I'm normally wear a 7 1/2, so I got an 8 and they were HUGE. Then I ordered a 7 and they fit perfect! They are a bit on the wide side so they're roomy, but the lace up means they're adjustable so that's good. The only thing is the buckle only removes two straps, and the other two are sewn on, so it's a  bit of a hassle to adjust the laces, but theoretically you'd only do it once, then use the zipper from then on. They do look kind of cheap as there's noticeable glue on the front seam, but I'm going to wreck these at Burning Man so I don't care. I'm sure the seller would take an exchange based on this issue but I'm not really complaining. I say, for the price, you can't beat it!	2015-08-12

Comparable comfort to wearing slippers. Now I have to get these in the black color as well. Definitely recommend!	2015-08-12

I know they are ugly, but I have decided to take pride in their appearance and make it a fashion statement.<br /><br />Not much to say about them... sandals, right? I do find that I don't like walking around in them in bare feet for long periods. Maybe it's the suede on my skin starts to rub? But if I'm doing something where I don't care very much about appearance (like running errands with multiple stops), I will put on a pair of socks, ratchet the buckles down a notch, and throw these clodhoppers on my feet for a very comfortable escapade. I recommend white socks to truly showcase your lack of fashion sense.	2015-08-12

Although a little expensive, they have a nice look that is capable of being worn with slacks and polo or button up so I bought them from him.  Big mistake!  They are not comfortable around the ankle.  I tried to wear a couple of times to break them in but couldn't stand them for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn't for that I may have liked them but for me, they were unwearable.  My son got them back along with his steel toe version and does not have the same problem so I guess it all depends on the person.	2015-08-12

These are the true polarized glasses that first came out in stores back East in the '80s. I own two pair of Sunclouds that are polarized, but the difference with Eagleyes is dramatic. The Eagleyes are much clearer. Whatever method of polarization Eagleyes is using, it is superior to others.<br /><br />Some reviewers felt these glasses were cheaply made, but that is not accurate. They are lighter weight than say the Sunclouds which are made with thicker plastic. The lens is what you're after here and that gives you the clearest, glare free vision and that's what it's all about in the summer sun.<br /><br />I'm very glad I got this and I thought the price was half what I paid for the Sunclouds. I highly recommend them.	2015-08-12

Unfortunately, as soon as I took them out of the box, I had a feeling--correct, it turns out--that I wouldn't be keeping them. They looked suspiciously narrow through the footbed, and while I was able to get them on, with space for thicker socks lengthwise, they were definitely tight across the widest part of my feet, pinching my pinky toes such that it felt my circulation was being restricted. I've never really been a believer in suffering for beauty, so I'm sending them back. However, if you have narrower feet (I'm almost always a 9.5M, but usually need a 10 in many Fluevogs), I'd definitely recommend them. In black, they're basic but not at all boring; they look fabulous on, esp. from the side, and as I can attest from owning other Fluevogs, you'll always get compliments when you wear them.	2015-08-12

Bought these for my partner and he likes them. they are VERY tight though so when they say sock, they mean sock. Not slipper you can wear socks under. He said that he found the stitching around the leather where the sock and leather meets very irritating and has to wear thin socks with these, which makes them more tight so he doesn't wear them for very long. They are a decent length, but don't have much in the way of padding on the bottom. I also don't think these would wear well if your guy is kind of like my dad who had extremely hard toe nails which used to cut through ugg boots after a years wear. The sock material is nice, but wont withstand those guys who don't cut their toe nails regularly. That's an overshare, but it is something to keep in mind! :-P	2015-08-12

I'm 26 year old, moderately fashion oriented, and a lot of people compliment these shoes not knowing what brand they are. (I get a kick out of telling them.... Crocs don't have a great reputation) These are the only shoes I own, including tennis shoes, that I can wear the entirety of the day with comfort. If I'm in a big city where I know there will be a lot of walking, I wear these babies. I have even done some HIKING in these! You guys, they're great.<br /><br />This is actually my second pair. My first pair bit the dust at the beach. They got super hot under the sun, and when I put them on and stretched the strap (as normal), they snapped. So... don't do that.	2015-08-12

I'd blame the kids except even the one I hid in my room for my use only stopped working. I'd blame over use but the one in my room was only used to browse Netflix and various other TV providers.

Everything about the original review applies but the right ear speaker snapped inexplicably at the extender. Apparently craftsmanship wasn't really too good either. Don't waste your money.   Original review:  To preface this review, I am an audiophile. When I think about buying earbuds or cans, I typically will put down quite a lot of cash. Sound and sound quality is important and it is easy to tell who has good speakers and who doesn't. Basically, I had a hard time thinking about this review. These cans are way better than the ps4 earbuds that come with the system, but they are not worth 130$. Basically, these are about 20$-40$ headphones but because they have the ps4 logo on them and they work with the ps4, they basically charge whatever they want.  I sort of knew this coming into this specific market but I didn't think it was that bad. My friends said turtle beaches are the best thing ever and if these are what they are charging close to 150$ for, I don't even want to know their 300$ model. At that price point, you can buy close to studio monitor cans, almost. My guess is that you get something still not worth it but slightly better. There is definitely 7.1 though... but don't be too impressed with the .1. From what I can tell, it has a lousy flabby base that is very loud but not precise, no treble worth a damn, and mids that are acceptable, but not very good.  That said, the wireless works beautifully. It comes from an optical to bluetooth usb device that plugs into the front port of the ps4. Also the boom mic is very stable and well made. They are very comfortable as well. It is unfortunately made out of plastic. I would have prefered metal at this price point but I guess they can sell them for 130$ so they do. It seemed basically that they spent a lot of time and effort to make them wearable and work with the ps4 and put in lousy speakers. Still better than the ear buds though. I am not impressed.	2015-08-12

This time it's for the HORI RAP 4 Kai.  This is currently the cheapest current generation stick on the market which makes it worth a look.<br /><br />Lets start out with the good.  You have a great price point.  With at least $50 less than the competition means that it's going to get some looks.  It has a carrying handle which makes it really easy to transport.  It's a bit lighter than the competition  and definitely has a smaller frame which means you are going to have no problem putting this into specialized bags for sticks are just common backpacks.  The frame is really solid and doesn't feel like it's going to give at all because of the metal frame.  The grip on the bottom of the is nice and makes sure you won't scratch anything the stick is on as well as making sure it won't slide.  The cord length is also great along with the compartment.  Really big and the cord is really easy to store.<br /><br />Now lets move to the bad.  Unlike the other two sticks in the compassion currently this stick is not easily opened.  The other thing is once you open up this stick you void the warranty.  The buttons aren't really as good as the competitions but they aren't horrible.  They are also easily replaced.  The lever is about the same.  The only thing that is bad about it is that it's harder to change the gate.  The Hayabusa lever has the gate screwed in and it's a lot bigger than a Sanwa gate.  You can put a Sawna octagon gate in it's place and usually it stays.  It just doesn't clip or screw into place.  Some people will not be happy with the base of the stick because it's not as wide as the others so there is a smaller place to rest your hands.  Also in the inside there is a lot of glue, so it's harder to change out wires or see what wires go where because there is glue over the labels.  Last thing is that space isn't at a premium with this stick so you won't be able to add things in as easily.<br /><br />All in all thisstick is a decent stick.  Especially at the price point. I would say if you have the money you should get the T.E.2.  If you don't this is a stick that will work and you can always swap out everything to sanwa parts to improve the performance.	2015-08-12

All the controllers fit in there fine and the fans work great to keep the console cool.<br /><br />The bad:  It is difficult to describe, but when you put the controllers in their slot, most of the time, it doesn't feel like they are connected.  It would have been nice to have a lite on the side to indicate that the controller is connected.  You pretty much have to pull up on the controller to see if the connection plug will have any resistance.  This problem is exacerbated by the cheap plastic feel of the thing.  I often worry I might break the connection plug if the controller isn't aligned just right.  So far that hasn't happened, so I hate to call it a bad, but I suspect my kids will not pay attention one day and destroy it.<br /><br />The annoying:  I like to play in the dark.  There is an LED on the front of this thing that is wicked bright.  It pierces my eyes like Apollo himself placed the sun in my living room.  I fixed it with a little black electrical tape so it isn't a big deal.<br /><br />Overall: Good product and is super handy if you have a lot of controllers that get used often.  I would recommend to buy, just be mindful that you'll have to treat it with care.	2015-08-12

I keep thinking I'm missing something but when try to go back and play it still find myself underwhelmed. I have about 7 hours and cant find myself trying to get to 8.<br /><br />The graphics in this game are beautiful. Character faces are incredibly detailed and I'm impressed with the small things such as the glint coming from the characters sword.<br /><br />Leveling up and the talent tree is complex and very well done. No complaints in that area.<br /><br />The character is very dull and boring... with seemingly little to no emotion. He talks with that gritty batman tone except he is monotone most of the time. I wouldn't mind so much but the game is incredibly story driven so you have to listen to it.<br /><br />I dont like the controls.  I have tried both, the keyboard/mouse and xbox controller. I find myself annoyed with engaging in battle. I'm constantly trying to target the enemy but by the time I get close enough to do so they see you and start running toward you. After backing up a bit the enemy runs back to it's original location like nothing happened. If you draw your bow and shoot it from a distance and you're not within its &#34;agro range&#34; it doesn't do anything. I hate trying to fight within their little agro bubble without coming out of it.  Movement is annoying. Sometimes I run in circles trying to get on my horse or try to pickup something. I'm also constantly turning on or off lamps or candles for some reason. Why are they there?<br /><br />There are quite a few missions that you have to complete in a detective style approach which gets annoying fast. I thought it was only for a couple of the first few missions but it seems that these types of missions are throughout the game. Please, I do not want to use my batman senses and follow footprints or blood trails around.<br /><br />Herbs are scattered around the map everywhere. I found myself grabbing as many herbs as I could until I realized you only need to learn to make a potion once then you know it forever.  Not sure why there are soooo many of these around. Not sure what the point is.<br /><br />Blacksmithing in this game is incredibly stupid.<br /><br />The game is open world but each area is broken into little quest zones where quests seemingly repeat themselves.<br /><br />I could go on and on. The game's just not for me.	2015-08-12

The Palutena figure performs all of the same basic functions as any of the amiibo used in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS / Wii U. You can customize and level up the figure as an &#34;FP&#34; or &#34;Figure Player&#34;, which is a computer player that learns and gains experience as you fight it. There's not much else to do with the figure in terms of software (Palutena is only compatible with Smash as of this writing), but being able to customize and train your own fighting machine is a fun experience, and certainly adds some extra things to do in Smash if you're playing solo.<br /><br />As for the quality of the figure herself, Palutena's paint job is phenomenal. Her face looks well proportioned (no wonky eyes here!), the accessories are all coated nicely, and overall I would say that this is the nicest amiibo from the Super Smash Bros. line released yet!<br /><br />Not to mention the actual process of ordering was so much easier than it has been in the past.	2015-08-12

This game includes kingdom hearts 1 final mix, kingdom hearts re chain of memories, and cinematics from kingdom hearts 358/2 days, all beautifully remastered in HD.  If you're like me and played the originals on the ps2 then this game will bring you to tears with nostalgia.  To this day this game has one of the funnest fighting systems in any game i've played, and some of the most intense boss battles. a must buy for any kingdom hearts fan.	2015-08-12
US	44413043	R2Q6I1YCUF5EOK	B002I092MM	976442722	Super Mario 3D Land	Video Games	5	1	2	N	Y	Awesome Mario game, 7 y/o son (and dad) love it!	Bought this for my 7 y/o son. Everything you love about classic Mario games all the way through the Galaxy series. I've played tons of Mario, and the levels are challenging as usual but nothing too difficult. My son has had a lot of time on the game, and really loves it, replays levels multiple times because it's just fun.<br /><br />If there was any negative, it'd be that it's maybe TOO easy to get extra lives. They're everywhere, and coins are constantly all over everything (and every 100 coins = extra life). Step on a goomba? Get a coin (or two, or three!). Bump a few bushes, coins. Slide down the pole? Extra life if you hit the top, plus coins, plus coins for all the seconds you have remaining in the level. It would actually be MORE difficult to run out of lives than not. My son has in two weeks accumulated 300+ extra lives. It's a bit unnecessary, but it's not like it hurts the gameplay. You just know you're never going to actually run out of lives, so what's the point of having them?	2015-08-12

We literally spend our entire weekends playing this game 24/7	This game has brought hours and hours of enjoyment to our household. We do mostly vocals, bass, ProKeys, and 5-lane Keys. We love the song choices and love the ability to integrate the older versions of the game into this newer version, which increases the number of songs available to us. The DLC is a really good selection, and if you're really looking for an adventure, I highly recommend purchasing from the RBN library (in the online in-game marketplace) for an even larger selection.  As Harmonix has decided to no longer produce DLC for this game, this particular version, the EA version, makes it easy to play custom songs offline (just don't play them online!)  And now that RockBand 4 will soon be available, I firmly believe this version will still be popular as the are many features that will be missing in the new RB4, such as online play.	2015-08-12

Absolute junk knock off controllers. Terribly cheap plastic. They don't even kind of resemble the picture.

I can't name many Grand Theft Autos that I did not like. GTA 3 is the first installment when bridging over from Playstation to Playstation 2 and fans were not disappointed.

The kinect is actually quite handy. I love the voice controls, but I wish there were more games that utilized it. Other than that, the game selection is great. Right now, I would say it's about on par with Playstations lineup, but the list of xbox exclusives is growing and the next year I think xbox will gain the edge. They recently announced backwards compatibility from 360 games too, which is HUGE. One of my biggest gripes in the beginning was how they claimed the One was supposed to be the all in one media center to take over you're living room, but still need my 360 because of the many games I already have invested in it. Finally the blu ray player is a great addition and something that was sorely lacking from 360.<br />Cons: The interface slightly clunky but not too bad. The large tiles feel like it was made for a touch screen, but navigating it with a controller is not quite as easy. The biggest complaint I have is with the social aspect. Parties are not even as easy to form as they were on 360 and they are unreliable. Also it is extremely difficult to send a message to someone who isn't on you're friends list, so if you play Destiny specifically and are a fan of destinylfg, you know the struggle.<br />Verdict: I have had the Xbox One for almost a year now and I still love it. It's not perfect, but it's been constantly getting better via monthly updates. Microsoft seems like they are listening to feedback and really trying to fine tune everything. Also the lineup of games that is coming on the horizon is going to destroy my wallet.	2015-08-12

This is my second import game for the PS4 (which of course works on a U.S. PS4). The game itself is hard to follow (because I do not know Japanese) but having watched subbed anime I can pick up the basics here and there. Plus there are a few places on the internet that can help get the basics of the story, and find translations of the menus. So not knowing the language should not impede the fun factor of this game. The combat is great and fun. Also the graphics are clean and sharp with very little load time. And even though there is a good chance that this title will come to the U.S., I really wanted to have another great Japanese import to play on the PS4.	2015-08-12

I am a hardcore sims 2 fan, and this was one of the last &#34;expansion packs&#34; i had to get. It did add a lot to the game, the holiday decorations (some halloween, a cornucopia for thanksgiving, party poppers, sparklers, noisemakers, for new years, a menorah, plus many many many christmas decorations!) were fantastic, and coupled with the seasons pack, it really added life to the game.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />There is a rather common glitch with this pack, and there is almost no way to fix it. The clothes dont load into the game. No clothes are present at all, and because the game cant &#34;find&#34; the clothes, santa claus and father time are EXTREMELY glitched. They wont mess up your game, but it is so disappointing to find that santas face is completely invisible and hes wearing a default business suit. There is no way to fix it, as the holiday pack melds itself into the base game data and cant be deleted unless you delete the ENTIRE game. Maybe this wont happen to you, and i still recommend the pack, but please back up your game before installing it so that if this does happen to you, you may be able to fix it with a complete uninstall and replace your game with the backed up files. Just a word of warning!	2015-08-12

A lot of research went into this purchase. I searched every kind of bundle every retail store had to find the most cost effective one there is and this one could not be beat. At least for me. Allow me to explain.<br /><br />I had no intention of buying this bundle for the games (Digital copy of Halo: Master Chief Collection and a physical copy of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag) mainly because Halo: MCC is not worth touching with a ten foot pole (unless you're into completely buggy and utter failure games) and Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was recently the free game of the month for gold members. <br /><br />No no no no. That is hardly a steal. In fact, I plan to sell both to make some kind of coin back, if any. (I spoke to Gamestop today and they're willing to take Assassin's Creed: Black Flag for a whopping $1.50. I don't even think driving to my nearest GameStop would be worth that.)<br /><br />I bought this bundle because of the extra controller it came with. Consider this. If I were to go to most retail stores, like Amazon, and buy a standard 500 GB Xbox One without a Kinect we are looking at roughly $350. With that, I have also discovered that buying a 'wireless controller NEW' separately is fairly costly. Amazon? $47.99. Walmart? $59.00 (Seriously?). Gamestop? See Walmart. So together, buying a standard Kinectless Xbox one and a brand new wireless controller would be roughly $400. <br /><br />So it is obvious that buying this bundle at $350 is the most cost effective purchase of most Xbox One bundles even out there. <br /><br />So here are a few side notes about this bundle that aren't already stated in this review or in the description (And if they are oh well haha).<br />-It comes with a headset. Handle with care! Although the microphone is surprisingly great quality, the flimsy frame can bust very easily if tossed around or accidentally sat on.<br />-Batteries are indeed included! Controllers require AA batteries and while I recommend buying rechargeable batteries, you can use the batteries it comes with for now.<br />-Mine came with a 14 day Gold pass. I'd assume yours will too.<br /><br />That's it for notes! I think this was a great purchase and I would highly recommend this buy for anyone. 	2015-08-12

I thought this game would be like Dead Space but I was very mistaken. The sound is great, I like the visual aspects of it, and the environment is creepy but overall its an average game.  I got bored with it quickly. Sneaking around and avoiding conflict can entertain only so much. Not my cup of tea.  It starts slow and then gets a little better. But to sum it up: The Alien cannot be killed! I probably died at least 30 times. At first it was exhilarating to get caught by the Alien and killed in different ways, but then it quickly got frustrating in some parts having to replay it over and over.   Actually I thought the game got better once the Alien was gone for awhile. Gave me time to explore and find collectibles. And once I found the flamethrower the confrontations with the Alien got less frustrating.   With a few tweaks here and there as far as (saving points, better stealth system, a little more action, an Alien that can be hurt) this game can be great. It has a lot of potential.	2015-08-12

This machine out of the box is not even playable on top of that it consume so much data in DLC patches that it is enough to drive you up the walls. You would be much better off buying something that actually allows you to play your video games without the need to connect to the internet even if you have a stable internet connection having to wait before you play your games every single time there is an update for that game or system if you dare want to use any of your DLC features or buy new DLC it's just ridiculous. This machine is not worth the money and you will regret it especially when you see that PlayStation 4 is not only better at playing games out of the box as far as how fast it can download to the hard drive but also the kind of game experience that you can have I have both consoles so I can speak freely about this subject as I'm not a complete and total idiot like most of the people who are going to buy this console and neglected ps4, with that said you really should reconsider even looking at an Xbox because I have had mine since launch and I promise you it isn't broken once it's not the build quality that will pissed you off it's the fact that you have to wait before you play every single title it gets very old very fast and I hate this machine more and more as the time I have it goes on I wish I never bought it never got it and just stuck with something different. I honestly believe the Wii U isn't better investment at least they play games out of the box at least and they don't require a system update every single time you turn the dang thing on. This console isn't worth any form of payment no matter how they dress it up they are selling you a lemon that can't even play games and you are agreeing to pay for a product that can not I repeat cannot play games out of the box which is the sole purpose of a video gaming console if you are too uneducated or to be responsible take care you will end up exactly like me with an Xbox one and a crap ton of regretfortunately I wasn't that big of an idiot as I bought ps4 first having an idea that the Xbox one was going to suck exclusives drew me in and I broke down because of a couple titles but I tell you what I hate this machine and no amount of fun I have had on this machine can balnce out how ridiculously angry it makes me.	2015-08-12

I am quite happy with the overall quality.<br /><br />First, the build quality is excellent.  I like the way the inner headband stretches a bit so the headphones can fit comfortably on my head.  They feel lighter than I would have expected given the size.  The ear cups feel comfortable on my ears for the most part.  The none issue I have with any over the ear headphones is that when I wear my glasses with the headphones on, the sides of my ears start to hurt.<br /><br />Second, the sound quality of these headphones is great.  Everything sounds crisp and clear.  I love how the microphone can easily be adjusted and the switch on the ear that allows muting.<br /><br />Overall, these headphones are a solid choice for people who play a lot of multi-player games.	2015-08-12

I would use it to play games from my bed, watch youtube or play it while the visiting GF was watching the TV. So I could bond with her, but not be bored watching stuff that I didn't like.

Controller is awesome, wish the battery was 3000 mah but it does the job for most phones. Little annoying for set up with the app rather than a straight blutooth connection and would be nice if you could plug straight into phone rather than always use blutooth since it has ports for it but awesome feel and size for the controller. Huge plus having the flip up phone holder rather than a mounted and love that it comes with a tablet holder	2015-08-12

I used the controller for 9 months with no issues with the analog sticks, then my friend comes over and plays it for a few hours, and now there are scratches in the material of the sticks.

Overall the game is a decent game. I remember it far too fondly as a kid and attempted to recapture that nostalgia of days gone past. Technically speaking their is nothing wrong with the game, however there is nothing exceptional about it either. The cut scenes are mostly ripped right from the movie and they compliment the main story quite well. The game has quite a few turret sections and tends to be a lot of wait for enemies to spawn so that you can kill them and leave the room. Has a very barebones combo system and unnecessary level up system which only drags out gameplay. If you are looking for a game that truly makes you feel like a Jedi I recommend Star Wars The Force Unleashed.	2015-08-12

I don't normally write reviews but after becoming so disgusted with this game I felt I must. I was excited for a single player game that according to other reviews &#34;this is what games should be&#34; so I went for it. I have litteraly walked away from this game on multiple occasions only to return with the hope it would get better but every time it was the same. This game gives you little to no instructions on what your current mission is. I found myself constantly wandering around wondering what the hell I needed to do. This removes all feel of a horror action game. I think fans of the book are the only reason this game has recieved the ratings it has. Save your money and time. I feel like I bought this game based off of good reviews and therfore tricked by someone who is obviously payed to write reviews.	2015-08-12

It's amazing having so much power I'm like a poke-god, literally PC boxes of just genesects and I've &#34;beat&#34; all my 3ds games. Overall, great product just strongly disliked the usb's cheapness I had to have in 93 degree angle upside down for it to work and after unplugging it the metal thing came out. I ended up using my own usb. One more thing, I don't know if it was my laptop or the powrsave but it would majotly lag for like just 5 rare candies and it would crash to the point of restarting. Awesome while it worked.	2015-08-12

I have never been this disappointed in a Video game.  I am a long time player of the Tiger Woods series.  I don't know WHAT this is?  I can't believe Rory Mcilroy even allowed them to put his name on such a P.O.S!  Do not buy this game.  Unless they drop the prices significantly.  It has tremendous potential, but there's no content!  More like a demo with the 8 courses it has, and 12 golfers.  I bought The Golf Club for $30 a couple months before the PGA release and have gone back to playing it.  Great online play, decent content, and course designer tool!  No PGA involvement, but it is what the EA game should have been!  I would not pay more than $20 for this video game.  I was able to get my money back on my original purchase and refuse to buy it until they add a tremendous amount of content.  At $60 this is robbery.	2015-08-12

This is the third game in the Toy Soldiers series,  and gameplay is mostly the same here,  but there is much more variety.  Overall the game is just a lot of fun.  Highly recommended!	2015-08-12

I was shocked with the camera position it's like you are playing on a board looking from above, watching little people running around. . To make it worst if you're playing with others you cannot be too far apart as the camera only capture a certain amount of coverage. You literally cannot advance or move without the other players if they are out of the camera boundary. You cannot look at what you want like  in a first person game.

This takes every MMORPG like World of Warcraft or Star Wars The Old Republic and meshes the good parts while fixing the stuff you always found annoying. You can be any class on one character by just equipping a different weapon. You can fork off your overflowing inventory to one of your two retainers inventories. It's just wonderful. It's also the only cross-platform game I can think of. My fiancee has the PC version, I have the PS4, I used to have the PS3, and it makes absolutely no difference. I can't say how much I love this game enough. There's a free 2 week trial out now where you can do most things (can't send messages, can't get any class past lvl 20, etc), but gives you a good feel for the game.	2015-08-12

I needed a wireless charger, since Microsoft is too cheap to include a wireless charger with your already-expensive purchase of the Xbox One.  The device charges quickly.  I also found that you can use the remote while it's charging.  It's not the most comfortable way to do so, but it still works if you don't want to step away from the action.<br /><br />The only thing that prevented me from giving it five stars was the sometimes difficulty with getting the remote to rest comfortably to charge.  I found that I had to adjust it several ways to make sure it was charging.  There were even times when it would start charging, but I would find an hour in that the controller had moved a niggling amount, causing it to not charge the whole time.<br /><br />Other than that, I would recommend you pick this up.  As long as you don't mind fiddling around with it occasionally, you won't go wrong.	2015-08-12

One might call it a masterpiece while some might say it's a piece of somethin else. But in all, the game is a variant from the others out there.

I never had high expectations for this game's storyline or its innovations. Maybe that is why I thought it was an amazing game. I have played every Call of Duty game since The Big Red One, and this has my second favorite story (behind Black Ops 1) and favorite game mechanics. Yeah it's bombastic and unrealistic. It's also a video game. I'll admit they should have omitted the second space mission (the first one was so cool and new, but the second felt unnecessary), but I have no complaints otherwise. I have yet to play online, but the bots actually seem smarter in this game. Less like omniscient losers (I'm looking at you Black Ops 2) and more like actual opponents. I have to work for my points but I don't feel cheated out of them. And the new stabbing mechanic is wonderful. The aliens modes are a bit disappointing, but I didn't pay 60 dollars for this game. I paid about 10. And at 10 dollars this game is well worth your time.	2015-08-12

As long as you get it for this price, you are golden.<br /><br />The large world they created is nice, but not close in size to gta5.  It's similar though and I'm not sure all that extra 'unvisited space' matters for most people.  They do have a very nice and tight story to the game.  I enjoyed the combat more over the combat in gtaV.  The story is also better in my opinion.  It's well worth $10 and if you haven't picked it up, do so.  I wouldn't give the same recommendation at $60, $50 or even $40, but this is a good game at a now bargain price.<br /><br />I played on 'easy', and loved it... as I generally 'suck' at these type of game, but wanted to enjoy the story.  You veteran shooters will obviously choose a higher difficulty level.  It's a great game, though it does have it's flaws.. however, for $10, I think you can overlook them.	2015-08-12

Both 007 Legends and Goldeneye: Reloaded started off with awesome concepts that they ultimate fumbled.  The latter ended up not being a remake of the classic game, but a completely new game that serves as a remake of the film with Daniel Craig in the lead.  Which was pretty cool, but not what most of us wanted, a modernized version of the best Bond game ever.  007 Legends seemed like was going to be a celebration of 50 Years of Bond in video game form.  Playing through the classic films as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, etc.  There would be Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, License To Kill, Die Another Day and Skyfall.  But it turned out to just be a tie-in with Skyfall, in which Bond (while unconscious after being shot by Moneypenny in the opening moments of Skyfall) dreams about the events of those films.  But once again the events have been reimagined as taking place in the Daniel Craig era, who you play as through all these missions.  It reuses the game engine, and really the premise, of Goldeneye: Reloaded, so it's basically just more of the same.<br /><br />As far as Gameplay goes, I found both of these games to be a step back.  It's essentially a Call Of Duty knock-off, which doesn't really fit the Bond style.  Unless they were doing a remake of Goldeneye N64, we've gotten past straight-forward shoot-em-ups.  Games like Quantum Of Solace and Blood Stone had incorporated the espionage elements of the films, and gave players the opportunity to stealthily sneak through and take down opponents in hand to hand combat or silenced weapons.  Of course if you wanted to you could just plow through with guns blazing, but the choice was yours.  That's not the case with these two most recent games though, they're just arcade style shooters that don't really capture the spirit of the franchise.<br /><br />Still, as a hardcore Bond fan I did enjoy playing it.  Just the curiosity of seeing how they treated the events of those films as well as seeing some familiar faces in various Bond girls, villains and their henchmen.  As they still use the original likenesses of the supporting cast in this game, unlike Goldeneye: Reloaded where they used different likenesses for all the characters.  If you're not really that into the movies I can't recommend this game though.  There are better FPS games, and better Bond games.	2015-08-12

It mostly revolves around flying to several different planets and running through piles of mobs and killing them to get to a boss encounter. There is a decent amount of variety in the enemy types, but it will eventually get old. The backstory is pretty lacking, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was never really getting to understand what exactly my character was doing or why. Still, I think the gameplay and coop experience was fun enough to be worth the purchase.	2015-08-12

That aside, the story is good, I love the art, and I found the game very enjoyable.	2015-08-12

This game seemed like a good deal after Curry and Harden combined for 49 points and dropped the game to $11. It has been nothing but disappointing as the animations are awful, rarely work.

I have played many past Elder Scrolls games, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, with various bonus packs. This game is somehow not the same, and yet not different, than the prior games. It has aspects of all the prior games (sadly without dragons) but adds tons of new features and a new world to explore. I think they are still in the process of updating and improving the gameplay. Keep in mind my PC meets or exceeds the &#34;recommended&#34; system and fast internet, so I don't have glitches like others have reported. Anyway, here are a few things to share:<br /><br />PROS<br />* I got this game for a steal. List price is $60, I got for $32 (incl tax). Includes unlimited gameplay (yes truly unlimited, no need to buy a monthly subscription), and a couple bonuses like a beginner companion and the ability to play any race with any affiliation. You can choose to pay real money to get &#34;crowns,&#34; which is a currency used to buy upgrades and special things (e.g., mounts) from the crown store. But there is certainly no need to! Honestly, $32 (or even $60) for so many hours of entertainment is a complete steal.<br />* Like all other ES games, it is a huge world that you are free to explore at your own pace. Many quests to choose from, and you can pick and choose which to work on. Or you can explore. Or interact. Or PVP. Or hunt monsters. Or collect books. Or work on fulfilling achievements. The possibilities are &#34;unlimited&#34;.<br />* Character creation and development allows you to personalize your character with great detail and develop them in a manner that conforms to your play style. For example, my typical character is always stealthy and uses a bow, which means my progress and exploration is slower but equally fulfilling. I was able to create the perfect character, although it took awhile to get my first bow.<br />* Rewarding gameplay - I have played a few hours each day for a week and am already Level 8. However, it is still challenging and I've died more than a few times.<br />* You can create up to 8 different characters to play, so the choices are truly unlimited!<br />* Ever been stuck in a situation where you get ambushed by too many creatures you can't handle alone? There are groups and guilds to adventure together! Each group can help since each person might have a different style of game play. However, I do always see ads for groups seeking healers, so there seems to be an uneven balance of players. Unfortunately, my style of gameplay is less valued in the group setting, so I will be playing more alone.<br />* Decent tutorial. Plus there is a special area/quest line based on your affiliation (mine is Bleakrock), which is a good area for lower players to get more experience.<br />* Some things are well organized. Like your inventory divides into subsections. Your journal divides into subsections by Main, Crafting, Guilds, etc. There are buttons and tabs everywhere if you can find them!<br /><br />CONS<br />* Took a long time to install. 4 disks plus patches. I finally gave up and went to bed so couldn't play my first day.<br />* Running into some glitches with patch updates. I keep getting a popup box that a patch is causing problems, and sometimes it wants me to &#34;Repair&#34; which takes a few minutes. Frustrating that there is not a better method for patching that avoids such errors.<br />* Carrying capacity - Like all past ES games, this is a challenge from the beginning. You start with 60 inventory spaces and have to buy expansions (which give you 10 more slots but cost exponentially more). You can also store things in your bank, which again starts at 60 slots and you have to buy expansions. There are so many different things you can pick up int he game that this is quite disappointing. For example, you need 10 iron ore to make iron ingot, and to actually craft you also need a style piece (e.g., bone) and optional trait. Then you can upgrade, but that is more items to collect and carry. There are like 6 different crafts in the game, each requiring a dozen or more items to collect. Not to mention the hundreds or thousands of other items!<br />* Map system could use improvement. The maps of Skyrim and even Oblivion were better than the map in ESO. Here, you have only major sites marked on your map, not smaller ones. The map is not very flexible in terms of zooming in/out, and when you're inside a city like Davon's Watch, you may or may not be able to see the map markers for quests outside the city.<br />* Travel could use improvement. Travel has always been an issue with ES games. In ESO, you have Wayshrines to travel between. You have to first find the wayshrines. Does it cost gold to travel between wayshrines? I dunno, I read a guide that said it costs, but then there are no popups in the game to tell you how much. Also the wayshrines are far apart and the only other way is your feet or a mount (which is expensive and you don't get until later in the game). You can also quicktravel to wayshrines from anywhere, but this costs. If you are in a group, you can travel to your group members, but the way to do this is cumbersome.<br />* Chat - I imagine like many other MMORPG games, there are some seriously messed up people using chat, and there is often very crude language and things posted for all to see. These people should be ashamed of themselves, and it sucks I have to read all that on my screen. I would like the ability to &#34;flag&#34; players who harass others or post inappropriate things, and have that person be banned from chat for a time or fined or something. But yeah, it's the chat feature and not the game itself that would make me reluctant to let kids or teens play this game.<br />* Stealing is much harder than past ES games. As a shadow character, I always relied on stealing. But in ESO, I have only found one fence location so far (by level 8), and it sucks to have to travel there each time (Plus you have to travel to the nearby wayshrine, then run/walk your way through the city until you get to the fence, it is slow). I often get caught stealing, because even when you are showing as &#34;hidden,&#34; you can get caught by someone spotting you while you have the container window open, or you get caught when trying to pickpocket someone rather than when you try to &#34;collect&#34; something from their pocket. Stealing is no fun anymore, even though you basically need to rely on it for gold.<br />* There is no thieves guild! This was my favorite guild in past games.<br />* There is so much that it is often overwhelming and confusing at times. For example, you press C for Character and K for Skills, and all sorts of other letters for different things. Thankfully these are laid out in the pamphlet that came with the game. But there are many other instructions not provided, like how to chat, how to interact, guilds, and most importantly the skill trees. I really liked the galaxy skill trees from Skyrim so this is a bit disappointing and confusing. There is no explanation as to &#34;active&#34; and &#34;passive&#34; skills, when/how you can get what, or really how to use them. You just have to test it out for yourself (and might end up killing an NPC or pet in the process of testing). You don't get skill points back, so researching them ahead of time is a must. Also, there are no instructions for interacting with the MMO aspects of the game. This being my first MMO (and only because I love the ES line of games), I have no clue about chatting and guilds and groups. Learning by doing because not many online sources discuss this in detail. The game tries to help you with pop instructions here and there, but it is insufficient. Would be better to have a &#34;help&#34; guide stored somewhere in the game to reference how to do something, the game is so complex.<br /><br />I think that's a good list for now. Loving the game despite the cons. It's a great achievement for the ES line and I expect it will get even better with time!wayshrine, then run/walk your way through the city until you get to the fence, it is slow).

Great Gaming	Video Games	5	3	3	N	Y	Best Media/Gaming/ Streaming TV Box You Could Buy Right Now	Media streaming boxes are everywhere now and they're continually popping out like rabbits.  All of them are pretty much the same; they run or stream Netflix (seriously, what *doesn't* do that now?) and a few other random apps or services and that's it.. You might get a gimmicky remote with one or an &#34;exclusive&#34; (read: officially supported) app/service with another, but overall, same cookie cutter box.<br /><br />However, every once in a while a new box is released into the over-saturated media streaming market and has unique features, design and the performance to make it stand out from the rest.  Well, I've only had this device for about a week now and I can already tell you this is one of the best media streaming boxes you can buy right now! I would say *THE* best, but for many, the extra firepower and features that this device provides is overkill and doesn't justify the extra $100~130 from other boxes like the Nexus Player, Roku 3 or Fire TV..<br /><br />But for the rest of us (tech enthusiasts, gadget geeks, gamers, and/or the ones that simply want to buy the best product in it's category at the time), this is definitely a must buy. In short, it does everything you command it to do with ease and can do a couple things other boxes can't (at least not yet). Add to the fact that it's getting great support from nVidia [just look at their System Updates changelog] and by extension Google (since they don't want Google TV to have the same fate as Android TV) and you've got a great product that keeps getting better.  Let me put it this way, it's convincing me more everyday to replace my (dual-core i7) HTPC with this box... (Which will most likely happen as soon as I get a 4K TV)<br /><br />What is or does GREAT (so far):<br />- Android gaming w/o breaking a sweat (and I'm talking titles like Doom 3 BFG, Half-Life 2, etc)<br />- Local PC game streaming (performs as good or even better than PS4 Remote Play or XB1-to-Windows 10 streaming - and using WiFi, BTW)<br />- nVidia's GRID service (also tested on WiFi) is awesome and free (until September)! - In my case, it worked so well that I forgot I was streaming Ultra Street Fighter 4. No input lag whatsoever.<br />- Kodi - Smooth and snappy performance even with heavy skins (haven't tried DD7/5.1 pass-through yet, but I read that it's working fine)<br />- Popular emulators run like a beast<br />- Rooting it and keeping it rooted is a cinch<br />- Sideloading apps is a breeze<br />- 2x USB3.0 ports (w/ support for USB-powered hubs) & latest Bluetooth - makes adding keyboards and other controllers (like the Xbox 360's) Plug-n-Play<br />- Can't wait to test the 4K playback..! (not a plus for my wallet, however)<br /><br />What ISN'T so GREAT (but not that bad either), so far:<br />- The included controller is a bit large and heavy, and doesn't always turn off right away when you put the console to sleep (not a biggie, really)<br />- They're also expensive; especially the voice remote (thankfully, other bluetooth remotes or keyboards work just as well)<br />- Google TV's Launcher is... just OK (not nVidia's fault), but again, there are other options and alternatives.. And GTV is already many times better than ATV ever was, and slowly getting better as well.<br /><br />Despite all that, this product deserves 5 stars and easily worth the price (especially with the $30 Google Play Store credit).  Highly, highly recommended./>- nVidia's GRID service (also tested on WiFi) is awesome and free (until September)! - In my case, it worked so well that I forgot I was streaming Ultra Street Fighter 4.

I've wanted a keyboard attachment for my PS4 controller for a while because we don't have cable, we just use online streaming services. This makes it so much easier to search for movies, actors & shows than having to manually use the joystick and selecting one letter at a time. I'm not a very technical person, so it took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to sync the Bluetooth because I've never used any other devices than the controllers. The instructions that came with the keyboard were helpful once I figured out where the settings were on my PS4 (lol, I know right). I wasn't expecting the charging cord to come with it, so that was a pleasant surprise. I'm really happy with my purchase!

The Pro Commander is a good controller with a rubbery matte feel and a button layout reminiscent of the XBOX 360. The familiar layout is a blessing and the thumb position is more natural than the official Nintendo Pro Controller. The control sticks are curved inwards which does help the thumbs from slipping off. The design is similar to Nyko's proprietary Android gaming controller, the Playpad Pro but it is built for gamers that are used to XBOX 360. As I said earlier the button layout is similar but the '+', '-' and Home/U button are also placed in the same location as the XBOX controller. The bumpers are also wider and thicker which makes them feel stiff and they take getting used to.<br /><br />The battery life is average, it's not terrible but like the Wii U gamepad the capacity seems the become less and less with continuous usage. When you shake the controller you can hear a moving part inside, it sounds like a small plastic piece. It doesn't take away from actual usability of the controller but it can be unsettling for some users.<br /><br />My major issue with controller- this happened around after one year of usage - is that I dropped it on the ground from about 2-3 feet and the left bumper stopped working entirely. Now I know this is my fault and if you are careful it shouldn't happen to you although I have dropped my Wii remotes many, many times and they are still functional.<br /><br />So with one faulty button coupled with a moving part inside and plastic buttons, the build does have a cheap feel to it. But I do recommend this controller to tactful users who aren't clumsy as dropping this controller is riskier than others. I also recommend it to people who are used to the structure of XBOX controllers. Overall it is a stylish controller and a cheaper alternative to the Nintendo Pro Controller.	2015-08-12

This is one of the best looking games on the system with brilliantly detailed graphics, high speed, and nice parallax scrolling. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't hold up very well. This game is brutally and unfairly difficult. It is a side scrolling beat' em up similar to Double Dragon or Final Fight, though nowhere near as good as the ladder. The moves all work and some are quite funny to watch. However where the difficulty comes in is in two player. This is often considered to be almost unplayable, as there is one huge, unavoidable flaw- Friendly fire. Yes, you can actually damage your teammates. If you aren't careful then this could entirely break the game. While the graphics are nice and the control works, the difficulty alone and the broken nature of two-player mode make this one of my least favorite of the Rare's NES offerings.	2015-08-12

There's no story. There's a huge rumor that the original campaign was trashed in early 2014, but Activision wanted to release the game anyway. So there's 'nuggets' of a pseudo-story in the game. There's definite levels, but no sense of progression. And the loot system and Light level system are infuriating.<br /><br />The Taken King is supposed to fix all this, but I already paid $60 for an incomplete game. Why charge us a cumulative $80 for DLC that should have been in the game on launch day? I'll never buy a Bungie game again.Don't be a sucker. STAY AWAY FROM DESTINY.	2015-08-12

I appreciate the microphone feedback, but, as other reviewers have said, the connection to the controller is the weakest link.  I have had some issues with intermittent connection which has made people unable to hear me in voice chat until I can get the wire to rest in such a manner that it stops.  It really reminds me of rabbit ear antennas and having to get them to stay perfectly in a spot to pickup good reception.  The headset is great, so if you have the new controller that has the jack input direct on the controller, toss the garbage connector and manage audio through your xbox.	2015-08-12

This is why I can never understand the mindset of a Sonic &#34;fan&#34;; not a FAN, but a &#34;fan&#34;. You know the kind; the person would crap on anything with Sonic's face on it if it's not exactly like the Sega Genesis trilogy from the 90s. Meanwhile, as the Sonic fan I am, I actually find more gems than lumps of coal in the franchise. Perhaps many of those &#34;fans&#34; lack a handheld system because Sonic the Hedgehog is actually most consistent with its quality on the go; when the Genesis games hogged the spotlight, the Game Gear games provided its own flavor of Sonic action. As the mediocre-ish Sonic Adventure 2 came around and was followed up by Sonic Heroes, the Game Boy Advance delivered its own trilogy of awesome Sonic games using the tried-and-true Sega Genesis formula, with an added burst of speed. When Shadow The Hedgehog was busy being awful, Sonic Rush paved its way to acclaim. And now we have Sonic Rush Adventure, a game that came out after Sonic seemingly betrayed console owners via Sonic 06. Is it as terrible as th-OF COURSE NOT!<br /><br />Being that Sonic Rush Adventure is a sequel to the first Sonic Rush released two years prior, the game continues to provide some of the best high-speed platforming action since the Game Boy Advance era. As Sonic the Hedgehog or Blaze the Cat, you dash your way through seven Zones, and at the end of each Zone comes a boss battle. There are also additional missions and Special Stages which are needed to get the best ending. Sounds pretty much like the oldschool Sonic formula we know and love! The structure is more elaborate this time around thanks to the whole treasure-hunting theme we have going here, but it's still familiar. Since the Zones are all their own separate islands, the world is spread out over a large ocean containing said islands, as well as various hidden locations. Traveling to these islands means you have to utilize one of what would become an arsenal of four crafts to drive through the water. Initially, you can only use a jetski, but as the game progresses you're able to use a sailboat, submarine, and hovercraft. Each of these vehicles actually provide their own unique gameplay styles, and they work rather well!<br /><br />The jetski has Sonic in a 3D perspective, but you move him by dragging the stylus left and/or right, dodging things in sight and hitting ramps to pull off sweet tricks, and you can Boost, allowing you to pummel destructible obstacles and gain speed. The hovercraft plays similarly, except you can't boost or find ramps; instead you can shoot and charge up your projectile, as well as do a spin attack. Because the sailboat has weapons aboard, its gameplay is actually more of a shooting-gallery type. And lastly, the submarine has you tap the enemies at proper timings, similarly to the likes of Elite Beat Agents. They're all actually pretty fun and add diversity to the experience as a whole. That isn't to say you should overlook the gameplay that goes on while on an island, though, because that's obviously where Sonic gets to do what he does best. Sonic has a variety of moves he can pull off, like the classic Spin Dash, grinding on foot, Boosting for speed at will, and tricks he can do in mid-air to increase his ability to Boost. The resulting 2D Sonic gameplay is fast and seamless, making each level feel like a rollercoaster ride filled with gorgeous environments and super-upbeat music!<br /><br />With every Zone there's a boss at the end waiting, and Sonic Rush Adventure tends to end each of the Zones with a bang; while the bosses themselves may not look like the most creative-looking bad guys in the Sonic series a whole, the fights they pull beg to differ! I honestly think these may be some of the most imaginative boss fights I've played in a Sonic game, and while they are rather on the easy side like in the old days, I found myself loving the process of defeating them. I mean seriously! One of the boss fights has Sonic running in 3D onthe bottom screen, and he must bounce up to the top screen via a non-exploding projectile where the boss awaits with two platforms! Not to mention the boss music helps add to these scenes.<br /><br />Alright, I think I'm done gushing over this game. There is just a lot in here that I can't help but applaud! Sonic's style of play is present and very well accounted for, and the graphics and sound are equally fascinating. This also goes for the new gameplay styles that get introduced upon using the water vehicles. The production values as a whole decorate this game in the best way they could, even if there are still loads of dialogue scenes done through text. Even then, the story is finely told, and the new supporting character Marine is actually not as bothersome as other new characters the series has introduced before. This is also the first Sonic game to feature online versus play, but sadly, with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection being extinct, you won't be able to play it against strangers around the world anymore (Although I assume it plays something like Sonic Generations in which the players race each other to the finish within the game's levels). Fortunately, the rest of the game is beyond remarkable, and therefore you should totally get it!

Never played this game before or knew much about the storyline. It is truly one of the best games I've ever played. I'm sure I'm not writing anything new on the topic, but the graphics were solid between the playable portions and the cut scenes, the voice acting was splendid, and the storyline was beautifully written. It is as if you are playing through a well-crafted movie. The gameplay was also very good. I haven't played a GTA game in years (since the overhead PC versions in the olden days) so this third person over the shoulder view and shooting system was slightly new to me. Crafting items, using stealth, and trying to properly use (or not use) too much ammo helped to make each encounter a nail biter. The fact that this also includes the DLC: Left Behind is a great addition.<br /><br />If I had purchased this at full price and had already purchased the PS3 version I wouldn't have given this 5 stars, but as a first time buyer and for only 10 bucks this was definitely the purchase of the year. Still going through the commentary.	2015-08-12

What a refreshing take on a beat-to-death genre.<br /><br />Things I like compared to other shooters:<br />1. No one &#34;camps&#34; because it does you no good in this game.<br />2. You spawn in the same spot every time. I find this a great idea because it makes it so much easier to learn the map.<br />3. The paint guns aren't like anything you've ever played with before. Which makes it so fun to tinker around with the different classes, sub weapons, and special moves.<br /><br />I played this with a friend of mine that I play Destiny and COD with, and he was asking me how much a Wii U is after playing.<br /><br />If you haven't bought a Wii U, this game might put that decision over the top. There's already a bunch of great titles, but this is just so different and fun that everyone who's ever enjoyed video games must experience.<br /><br />NINTENDO: keep the DLC coming!

What it seems like they did was to try and make a sequel as cheaply as possible, in this case by basically re-using almost the entire map. The major change is that now the city is being overrun nightly by what are basically zombies, and so the tone of the whole game is a different one.<br /><br />I had been hoping for a new city, some new weapons, and some new cars, but largely the same general idea. Maybe this will grow on me, but it hasn't done so yet.	2015-08-12

A lot of people don't mention what this bundle actually includes.<br /><br />In this Bundle:<br />-32 GB Wii U<br />-Splatoon Download ( There is a code you have to scratch off a card and redeem in the Nintendo E Shop )<br />-Nintendo Land ( it comes Pre-Installed )<br />-Wii Sports ( I mean not the biggest perk in the world but it's there )<br /><br />All in all a pretty sweet deal considering. Either way it's worth the money especially if you are on the fence like I was. Pick it up! Splatoon is a super fun and awesome game for all ages alike and the Wii U is nice to have. It's small, light, and it's nice to sit in bed and watch netflix or casually browse Miiverse :P	2015-08-12

At first i was worried about the mic length or if my friends could hear me, but that wasn't a problem, but I needed to talk loud or askew the headset from the mic side. Though, the mic can turn left and right for a better radius.  The only problem is it feels a bit flimsy and is a bit small. It fits me fine, but i can only imagine for people with small heads. It comes with the headset, very small USB cord (for your controller so you can update its software) and a separate controller adapter which can range from $20 to $30. So the headset in reality is $30. Great product for somewhat light gamers.   UPDATE: It broke :(  The plastic broke off, but it still works. I would not recommend the mic if you have a lot of money to spend, but it lasted a very long time and I still have the small USB cord and the headset adapter which I can use on any other headset or just plain earphones (earphones will not pick up your voice although). All in all, I would buy again, but considering I already have the adapter and USB cable, there should be a price drop.	2015-08-12

No Complaints	My son wanted to try this game after his football interest spilled over to Arena Football over the summer.  We play this game together and its &#34;not just another Madden Game&#34;  It has many more features, and is much more fun then Madden( albeit it is hard to know who to play as you are unfamiliar of the talents or what you are up against!).  However, I think that adds to the fun as well.  We also set up tournament brackets and allow the computer to play itself.  It's like watching football live.  We have an original PS3 (Version 1) and it upscale to wide-screen format beautifully.  The coaches argue with refs and players which really adds another dimension to the game.  Lots of fun for a cheap price! If you like Madden, you will love this game! Delivered on time and as advertised.  Nice Job! No Complaints.  Therefore - Five Stars!	2015-08-12

I previously had the Turtle Beach 500x Stealth headphones and while they sounded great, the wireless connection was terrible. These are a different story. The sound is above average because they're not surround, but stereo sound, which is great if you're not looking for Astro quality sound. But if you're looking for comfort and easy wireless setup (literally plug the receiver in and turn them on, that's it), these are the way to go. I wouldn't recommend them for professional competitive level play (that's the Turtle Beach Elite 800x), but more for playing in silence without bothering anyone. The mic is removable and they can be used as regular headphones for music.	2015-08-12

Good quality for an unlicensed product! It isn't much of a &#34;hard&#34; case as described; instead, the clamshell feels a bit spongy, perhaps styrofoam-like. It will probably shrug off several accidental drops without much issue, though you might find your battery cover is loose after a drop. I've never owned or used any official PSP merchandise, though, so I have nothing to compare this to.<br /><br />No issues with the zipper or clip. The PSP-2001 fits snugly inside, although it can really only be slid in and out one way due to the PSP's button configuration. I only wish there were some room to fit some extra UMDs -- but hey, that's not what this was designed for anyway. There is a velcro attachment inside that allows you to pack two additional Memory Stick Duos in the clamshell opposite the system.<br /><br />My favorite part is the Engrish on the product's packaging. It made me and my girlfriend chuckle.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this product to anyone who's still looking to protect their PSP-2000 or PSP-3000. I'll update if any problems arise!	2015-08-12

It does what it says. Though in order to charge via the extra hubs and charge your controllers, the PS4 has to be on, not on standby. Which should have been an obvious thing to me, but oh well. Anyway, the fan is NOT noisy at all. I can't even hear it (makes me wonder if it works, lol!). Serious though, if it does start to make noise, which it hasn't, there is an off/on button for it. It takes a bit to get the controller in the charger station, but once you do and get the hang of it, it will be second nature almost. Controller fits perfect. I don't have usb accessories for the PS4 so I can't vouch for how well they work connected to the ports on the charger station itself as opposed to be plugged into the PS4 directly. But it does turn one PS4 port into three. So that makes it pretty cool.	2015-08-12

This accessory is compatible with 3DS, 3DS XL/LL, New 3DS, New 3DS XL/LL, DSi, and DSi XL/LL.<br /><br />If you use a USB battery pack (Anker, RAVPower, etc) and normally pair it with micro-USB, you'll benefit greatly from this accessory. Instead of having a micro-USB and a 3DS power cable, you just need the micro-USB cord and this small adapter to charge your devices. The adapter is small, less than an inch in length, so I suggest getting a wrist strap for your 3DS and looping the adapter through it (see images) to keep it from getting lost. Doing so is also convenient because it will always be on your 3DS when you need it.<br /><br />If you find that your 3DS power cord length is too short or too long, this adapter will help you. Since the selection of 3DS power cords for purchase is minimal just about everywhere, you could get this adapter to expand your selection to micro-USB cords as well. For instance, if you want a 15 foot 3DS charging cable, you'd be hard pressed to find one. However, with this accessory, you could instead find a 15 foot micro-USB cable (which is much easier to find).<br /><br />Will your 3DS charge slower with this accessory? The simple answer is no. This is just an adapter, it doesn't really change anything. The power source and the micro-USB cable that you choose will be the limiting factors. If you plug this accessory into a wall charger that you use for your phone, you should be fine. Most phone chargers are rated between 1A and 2.4A (5V), which is still greater than the 3DS's 900mA (5V) rating anyways. If you plug this accessory into your computer, you will be getting 500mA out of the rated 900mA (5V) charge rate of the 3DS which will take roughly twice as long to charge to full capacity unless you have a USB 3.0 port which is rated at 900mA (5V) which will charge at full speed.<br /><br />The adapter is currently a little pricey ($8) since you could just buy an off-brand 3DS charger cable for less. However, I think that this cable is very convenient and is more than worth it for someone who wants to cut down on cords, or uses an external battery pack.rge at full speed.

I couldn't be happier with the g190. All that was missing was the logo.<br />The screen is a great size and has no glare even in direct sunlight. I am even able to play with a friend and share the screen with no problems at all. The speakers leave a little to be desired but are more than adequate for their size. It also has two headphone jacks even you'd prefer. I was able to fit an Xbox one, all cables and power supplies (including the screens power supply), and one controller in the box without any problems. I don't think you can fit two controllers in it with the Xbox one, but maybe could with a ps4 being that there's no power brick. There is room to put a couple of game boxes on top of the console and shut the lid without them touching the screen but I don't feel comfortable with them sliding around in there. But you could if you were so inclined.<br />I travel with this to and from work on a river boat and so far it's been great. I set it up and take it down daily with no problems. Perfect little gaming set up.	2015-08-12

It is a rail shooter game similar to the Virtua Cop, Time Crisis, and The House Of The Dead series, where you role play as some sort of cupid angel that lures around what it seems to look like a private junior high school, and your purpose is to raise the inter-course vulnerability of the female students and female staff by stimulating their erogenous pressure points with your arrows.<br /><br />You can play with your regular PS3 controller but it is meant to be played with your motion PS Move controller for best performance and enjoyment. This game is only in Japanese so unless you understand the language you won't be able to follow the dialogue because it hasn't been localized for west audiences, but it is fun regardless of that, as most Japanese rail shooter games are.	2015-08-12

So I've been playing since launch and I think I've finally gotten enough of the game in to write a good review.  I have a V10 healer and have done almost everything other than end game trials and some of the Craglorn quests.  After the worst day one of any game I've played its fully redeemed itself!  Its by far the most versatile MMO I've ever played.  You can literally play any character or class any way you like, I just played with a rouge healer last night lol.  The amount of content is mind blowing, they even do a pretty good job of mixing up the quests.  The graphics are next gen worthy, the professions have a solid purpose, there are around 30 different dungeons all with normal and hard difficulties.  I could list things I like about it all day!  Some things I think would turn a person off about it is a much smaller list but to be fair ill hit a couple of those too.  IT TAKES OVER YOUR LIFE!!!!  I find myself working my life around research timers and stable upgrades, its kinda embarrassing, my girlfriend even knows the schedule!  If you don't have friends who play it will not be as fun.  Of course you can still play and meet friends but probably not gonna be as fun.  There isn't a centralized auction house.  there is a way to sell things to other players but its done through &#34;guild traders&#34; and you can only sell if youre a part of the guild holding the trader.  This is actually kinda annoying because it makes it hard to develop a secondary market for items.  All-in-all I think its a great game to play with friends and I highly recommend it!	2015-08-12

The sheer amount of activities you can engage in in this game is very overwhelming but the good kind.<br />GAMEPLAY: Solid. It feels very unique but not unlike many MMOs you'd see on the Web these days. You have varied kinds of attack methods, such as Ether (magic) based ones, support (healing) and basic physical attacks along with a few others. Some of these need to be prioritized based on what type of enemy your encountering. For example, you'd want to use &#34;Purge&#34; to get a certain type of enemy's barrier down and can actually attack it.<br />THE WORLD / SETTING: This game excels at making you speechless when you encounter a new area for the first time. The amount of creativity is just so unrivaled, it really is amazing. I remember many, many times going back to a certain locations (all of them ^-^) just to sit there and take in the view. Now, before I go any further, I will say that this did look a lot better on a TV screen than on the 3DS. Why? The 3DS has to compress the image and it obviously looks a little jittery. BUT- still amazing non the less. The fact that you play on two giants is quite amazing and going back to the view part, when you for instance go to Bionis Leg (yes his leg) and you move the camera toward the sky, you will see that the other titan, Mechonis is creepily looking down on you with his blood-red eyes. It's even worse at night (in game) because that's all you can see....is....his....eyes..... This happens in many locations too. 10/10!<br /><br />SOUND / MUSIC: Again, unrivaled. Each area has a two different themes, one for the daytime (lively) and one for the nighttime (somber) Not to mention you visit like 30 major places in the game. That's 60 different songs! Not even counting the cut-scene songs, intro, and battle. And it's so high quality, like not cheap. Every area's track fits it to a T. One can only wonder how much money they spent on the Orchestra....Voice acting is great! I just didn't care for Fiora's VA. It's not that she didn't deliver, it's just an annoying voice (IMO). 10/10<br /><br />ART / GRAPHICS: The art in this game is beautiful is I didn't say it already. The plains look very lush, the jungle looks humid, and the marsh looks, well, like a marsh. Foggy. Like I said before, I must've visited all the areas at least 4 times JUST to look/explore it's scenery. I honesty feel like they couldn't have rendered this game any more beautiful than it already is. Graphics are from a 4 year old Wii game but HEY that does not bother me one bit, you know why? Because the art makes up for it and honestly it's not bad at all to begin with. Although I won't sugar-coat it, the Wii version did look a bit...crisper than the port for obvious reasons. 10/10<br /><br />THE PORT: Here it goes: It's not the best it could've been. Every time I'd fight a huge monster (one that takes up the whole screen, the frame rate and whole game would just drop very slow. So it made the &#34;slow time events&#34; even slower. They should've increased the CPU or whatever it's called to make this game run more smoother. I did not have too many of these &#34;slow battles&#34; and they weren't unbearable but still annoying none-the-less. HOWEVER. I really don't want this part to dissuade anyone from buying this fantastic game. When Amazon asked me to review this game I wasn't even going to put this but since I'm being completely honest I thought I should. I still enjoyed it regardless. Who knows? Could just be my copy. 8/10<br /><br />OVERALL: Please, please do yourself a favor and buy this game. I can almost guarantee that you'll love it. Believe it or not, I just clocked in around 160 hours or so, but that probably because I tried to take on most of the game's 400+ side quest. Just the story is about 70 something hours if your doing a speed run without the New Game+.<br /><br />Buy this. I did and now I 'am a very happy person :)e for Fiora's VA.

The sounds are so clear and are so amazing that it left me speechless. My only complaint is that they are not &#34;fully wireless&#34; for an xbox one you will need to order an extra surround adapter that plugs into your controller which requires a wire from the controller to the headset. But one little wire is a small price to pay for these headphones. These headphones are also compatible with Ps4 they do not need an adapter they are fully wireless which makes them that much better! They are worth every penny and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a fairly priced headset for gaming!	2015-08-12

This is  currently my favorite game for the PS2. Picture Dark souls with a first person perspective, and add a masterfully written musical score, and you have Kings Field...well, kinda. There is definitely alot of similarities between the two. The world of Kings field seems to have more of a feeling of desolation and madness. Tons of weapons and armor with a huge world to explore. AND NO LOADING SCREENS! Even when you figure out how to teleport, there is still ZERO loading screens. I didn't like it at first, but I toughed it out until I was able to use magic, and what I found was a truly immersive experience. This game is long, but  just when you think it's almost impossible, you find exactly what you needed to get by. This is an intricate and well thought out RPG that deserves to be recognized. Some of the world you will see in Kings Field is absolutely insane, much like Dark Souls. If you haven't played Kings Field yet, then you are seriously missing out.	2015-08-12

Unfortunately the game freezes so many times it just takes away from the experience. Although, I played the main campaign on a regular edition, purchasing this version for the DLC, and while the game froze a couple times, it wasn't really that bad. The DLCs however, most notably Old World Blues, are just really prone to freezing (Dead Money ran pretty smoothly though), that you'd just feel tempted to quit altogether.	2015-08-12

I wish there was more of the events and both men and woman's. For example, I would have liked to seen Long track speedskating with all the distances as the cover shows long track speedskating. Also it would have been nice if they included more races in the short track speedskating, as someone who used to compete in both long track and short track speedskating this is just my preference.  In addition, I think if they included both of the ski jump events it would have been a bit better. The sledding sports are ok. I will say the snowboard events are the easiest ones to pick up.	2015-08-12

This game is pretty cool, it's got easy controls and in the beginning when you hit new game it starts just like Shrek forever after does with Rumpelstiltskin telling the story and ripping pages out of the book. My 8 year old got the hang of it pretty quick after looking at the page in the game instructions with the controls on it. The controls are easy to remember once you start playing.  My 8 year old enjoys playing it on our compute, he is definitely better at the game then I am! You have Shrek, puss in boots, Donkey, and Fiona are in an alternate version of their lives where Shrek was never born.  Shrek signed a contract giving Rumpelstiltskin one day from his childhood without thinking so he could have one day of being &#34;a real ogor&#34; again, little did he know Rumpel would take the day he was born. Now in the game you get to be Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Puss in boots and complete quests to defeat Rumpel and get Shrek's life back! I am completely satisfied with this game and how easy it is for my kid to play.  The graphics are pretty good too. These are absolutely my very own honest opinion after having received and tried this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.	2015-08-12

Game play was fun. It was highly customizable. I really liked it. Though I think game play mechanics could have been better. When you kill some one, you should really feel it. Take Witcher 3 or Shadow of mordor. Ubisoft can learn from them. However, I enjoyed game, finished 40% of main story line, many side missions, Co-op missions, upgraded my gear thoroughly. Earned trophies and was enjoying game thoroughly. Then suddenly Boom! I rested my PS4 and came back after a nap to find that my entire 20 hour game data is CORRUPTED. ITS GONE. ENTIRE GAME GONE IN THIN AIR. JUST LIKE THE GAME LEAD ARNO VANISHES AFTER ASSASSINATING SOME ONE.No previous saved data available. Thank you Ubisoft for messing my game.
