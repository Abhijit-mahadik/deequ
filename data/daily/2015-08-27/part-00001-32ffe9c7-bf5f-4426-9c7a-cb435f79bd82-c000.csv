It's a third person action rpg with a pretty good story. I'm on episode 6 but a lot of features have yet to unlock. Everything is customizable from the combination of various parts to modifies the parts themselves. The difficulty of the game progress as the story line progress, so you will never be so over power that nobody can beat you and there's actually a lot complexity in the system that I'm discovering new things every time I play.  Pros: Lots of Customization Mech Battling system is quite smooth Very much action oriented Good difficulty Curve Good Dollar per hour entertainment value  Cons: I would like faster way to travel Inventory Management isn't ideal   UPDATE: about 40 hours into the game and it have crashed 3 times.

I first bought the EX-05 and it lasted me about two-three years and it was damn good. After long enough it crapped out and stopped working, but my warranty had been up for whatever reason and they refused to do anything so I shopped around for a new Gioteck product and found the EX-05s. It's been a couple of months since purchase and its microphone has failed. I woke up one morning and the microphone wouldn't pick up any sounds other than tapping on the little control box.<br /><br />Now, here's a breakdown of my rating:<br />Comfort: 3/5<br />Metal bars are uncomfortable and made me wear the headset all wonky sometimes, I preferred the EX-05. However, the ear cups are superb. They fit nice and snug around my ears but not to the point where they're trapped in there.<br />Sound Quality: 5/5<br />I've never owned a super high quality headset with major acclaim, so thus far these headsets are the best I've ever had.<br />Durability: 4/5<br />The EX-05 pooped out after a reasonable time for the price I paid, but the S fell from my graces earlier than I was hoping/expected.<br />Microphone Quality: 5/5<br />Never had complaints from my friends and I felt it was a quite good quality.<br />Support: 1/5<br />Their support is mediocre;<br />&#34;Oh did you open it? It looks like you may have tried to open it, your warranty is void.&#34;<br />&#34;Oh you bought it a more than a year ago? Nope.&#34;<br />Real friendly, huh?<br /><br />Truthfully, I'll never buy a product from Gioteck again and I'm waiting for their support to get back to me. However, these headsets are pretty alright in my opinion, but don't go in expecting them to be these fantastic crafts of grandeur.	2015-08-27

US	24740557	R3UW9JDAEL110F	B00HQPUWBO	530984598	Evolve	Video Games	4	3	4	N	Y	Gotten Better Since Release	The game has received mixed reviews from all sources, so I'll give it my quick, honest coverage.<br /><br />It looks pretty, sounds amazing, and is a lot of fun to play - to a point. If you get bored of repetition, this is not a game for you. There is one primary game mode that can be played as a competitive online leaderboard chase, Hunt. In addition, the Evacuation &#34;campaign,&#34; and I use that term loosely, adds Nest, Rescue, and Defend modes to Hunt in a 5-stage match with balance shifts to favor the losing side.<br /><br />Alongside these basic modes is Arena, where a Stage 2 Monster is pitted against a Hunter team in a permanent dome: kill or die.<br /><br />Arena is fantastic for quick, entertaining, heart-pounding matches if you like excitement. Evacuation gives you a more immersive experience if you're into feeling the atmosphere of a game, and it's great for leveling up to get your max level perks. Hunt is the game's primary existence, always chasing a few more wins to get the next rank on the boards.<br /><br />Now that the game has expanded to this degree, I feel comfortable rating it 4 stars. Monster gameplay continues to to be unique and thrilling, with Stage 1 being terrifying as you flee the enemy Hunters, and Stage 3 giving one a kind of maniacal ego boost as you rampage all over the poor humans who were silly enough to chase you down. Hunter gameplay is heavily, HEAVILY dependent on good teammates. If you're still learning the game, play in Solo with the difficulty favoring your team or you'll have a hard time winning as Hunter. The best way to play Hunter, though, is to get 3 other friends together and queue up as a full team to destroy the solo Monsters.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the DLC - the vanity items are wonderful but a bit pricy, and offering new Hunters and Monsters is becoming ridiculous in terms of scheduling. A year to stretch out 5 new characters is excessive, considering the Tier 4 Hunters and Behemoth were all released at the same time. It would also be nice to see price reductions for the older tiers of characters over time, to encourage purchases later on as new content is released. Maps and game modes continue to be freely added to the game, not as DLC.<br /><br />Overall, a solid game, especially if you like playing Monster, or have friends to play Hunter with. Suffers from DLC shenanigans.at the same time. It would also be nice to see price reductions for the older tiers of characters over time, to encourage purchases later on as new content is released.

The question was:  would it live up to the hype.  The answer is far and away YES.  Most likely the greatest football game ever made.  If you like football and know real life football strategy, this is the game for you.<br /><br />WR/DB interactions were one of the big selling points this year and it delivered.  Seeing the animations play out between a WR and DB is a thing of beauty.  Once you learn the controls you realize that player ratings certainly okay a huge factor in how the animations play out.  If your opponent has a big time receiver you had better use bracket coverage or else you will get smoked.  While you would think this would favor the offense, using solid defensive techniques leads to locking down the receivers far more often then not.<br /><br />The running game is also much improved and is easily the best running game released in a video game.  Following your blocks and cutting at the right time is crucial.<br /><br />In CFM, the new in game dynamic goals are very well done and follow along with what's happening in the game.<br /><br />While there are a few bugs to be ironed out, this game is very good.  I say an 8.5/10 but if they iron out some issues then it's easily a 9/10	2015-08-27

I bought it new after playing DS2 on the X360; therefore, the game is not as exciting as it first was. I wanted the DLC and to see how it would look on the PS4.<br /><br />Anyway, Scholar's biggest improvements are its fast load times (less than six seconds), smooth frame rate, and ability of the PS4 to handle every lighting and texture effect easily. The game is more stable than the original DS2. No texture pop-ins or muddy lighting or network issues. When you click on bloodstains, the phantom players springs up instantly. For those seeking extra challenge Scholar populates areas with more enemies. Heide knights aplenty await you at Heide's Tower of Flame. Graphically the game looks like a high end PS3/360 game, so if you're hoping this version will be a big visual overhaul, you'll be disappointed. (Bloodborne shows you what a real PS4 title looks like.)<br />I recommend buying Scholar at $29.99, not at its present $39.99 price. The game it's based on is over a year old and has aged.	2015-08-27

Dying Light is a must-have for zombie enthusiasts.	Do you like zombies? If yes, you'll love this game. If not, you'll love this game.<br /><br />Dying Light is an amazing first-person zombie apocalypse-themed game set in an open world. Yes, zombies. Yes, open world. You will traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious epidemic, scavenge the world for supplies and craft weapons to defend against the growing infected population with a heavy focus on parkour mechanics, allowing you to perform actions such as climbing ledges, leaping off from edges, sliding, jumping from roofs to roofs and zip-lining.<br /><br />When I heard about the game, I watched the trailer and saw that it was built around the idea of parkour. My main reservation was wondering how they would incorporate zombies and parkour into a successful game. Unfortunately, I held off on buying the game for quite some time before actually giving it a shot. That was a mistake. The game is mostly melee-based with the majority of fighting using melee weapons. There are more than 100 weapons that can be used and more than 1000 weapon possibilities when players begin crafting new weapons. The melee-weapons have a limited lifespan and will be degraded and eventually broken if you use it for combat for a long time. Yes you can repair the weapon, but only for a limited number of times. Crafting weapons require crafting ingredients such as gauze and metal parts and a blueprint, which can be scavenged or purchased from a shop. I can't even continue to describe how amazing the developers did at incorporating a true survival world and immerse you in it.<br /><br />Most impressive is how much the day-night cycle changes the game drastically, as enemies become more aggressive and more difficult to deal with during night time. I've literally sped the game up to daytime just to avoid how scary playing at night is. I don't think there is a person that owns this game that hasn't, at one point or another, gotten completely spooked at night-time. While you do have a choice in changing between day and night, there are a lot of quests that force you to play at night.<br /><br />If you like zombies, buy this game. If you like open world, buy this game. If you like survival, buy this game. You will not be disappointed!a choice in changing between day and night, there are a lot of quests that force you to play at night.<br /><br />If you like zombies, buy this game.

It is similar to checkers and revolves around beating the computer player or a friend in 2 player.<br /><br />The game does not have any fun animated cut scenes or story to speak of.  Spot does not do any neat dance moves or anything really relevant.  I believe they also made a side scrolling action game for the Gameboy and that was the game I originally wanted to buy and just picked the wrong game.<br /><br />This game pretty much sucks.  You basically win by chance.  It is a turned base puzzle game with very little imagination just move your dots to consume the other player.  Simple games are not bad if they have good play control or a fun little story.  This game was probably just pumped out there for marketing purposes I highly doubt that it helped 7Up sales. If anything it probably drove people away from the brand.<br /><br />1 to 2 star game skip this one and save your money for a better puzzle game like Tetris or Dr. Mario.<br /><br />Gameplay: 3/10<br />Play Control: 4/10<br />Story/Originality: 1/10<br />Challenge: 7/10<br />Replay Value: 2/10	2015-08-27

While its so chock full of horror cliches you'd think it was a parody, they're handled so well and delivered creepily enough to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />The division of plot lines is really well handled, and while a decision at the very beginning doesn't have ripples all the way up to closing credits, it does have ripples past the canned scene. And while the overall feel is as an interactive movie, thats not a bad thing in this case, as the characters are actually characters. While they are all sex-fueled teenagers, past that point they do develop and have impressions beyond Blonde Murder Victim #4 and Brunette Murder Victim #2.<br /><br />Gameplay does have some down moments. Certain qte's don't have any warning, and the still sensor (where you don't move) is so sensitive that putting on a flat surface is too much. Certain moments shouldn't be qte's, but overall, the system works well. The Butterfly effect system is great, as it shows you you did x so y and z.<br /><br />THe game development is great, especially with the psychotropic therapist, which serves to cater and modify the story. Terrified of Clowns? The murderer is suddenly sporting a mask. Scared of rats? They'll start to appear in the worst possible places.	2015-08-27

Like the other reviewers have mentioned it is difficult game.  But every Battletoads game is hard.  The game has lots of different types of stages from straight forward beat em ups at the beginning, Rocket scooter, space shooting, jumping platforms, vertical climbing stage all trademarked in the original NES Battletoads game.<br /><br />The sound is very good as well as the graphics for the time period it came out in.  The only downside to the game is that you are only able to be 1 of the 3 toads. The queen taunts you the whole game and you never get to fight her. The final boss is her big huge mechanical henchman guy.  The game is only about 6 or 7 stages long and does not offer a password feature so you have to beat it in one shot.  The play control is spot on and very responsive.<br /><br />The hardest part of the game is getting through the final stage before time runs out.  The stage is pretty unclear what they want you to do once you get to the end.  The final boss was a decent challenge but making it to him was much harder.<br /><br />The trick to beating the game is making it through the lower levels with as many lives as possible.  So on the scooter stage if you keep dying over and over just reset the game and start over until you pass the stage in 3 or 4 tries instead of 10 or more, because you will never have enough lives left to finish the game.<br /><br />Once you beat the game you will have a wonderful feeling of accomplishment like beating Ninja Gaiden for the NES.  These games are difficult even for seasoned players and you should be proud if you complete it.  If the game just had a little more to it, and allowed you to battle the queen and shut her up it would be worth 5 stars but as it is.  It is just a solid 4 star game all around.<br /><br />Gameplay: 8/10<br />Play Control: 9/10<br />Story: 6/10<br />Challenge: 10/10<br />Replay Value: 7/10	2015-08-27

It functions fine, but these controllers break down quickly. Somehow, I've already replaced it 3 different times...and all three times for the same reason. Clicking the joysticks makes the internal parts break down quickly. Once worn, the joystick will stick constantly. The obvious implications for driving and shooter games show why the constant need to replace it rather than just suffer through. Since the non-xbox options are pretty limited, one deals with the hassle.	2015-08-27

Online gaming is incredibly fun and quite a good way to pass time.<br /><br />That aside, there are downsides to X-Box Live that can be avoided through prepaid cards. Number one, you always run the risk that unwarranted transactions will be made if your credit card information is stored on your X-Box 360 system. It may not happen all that often, but it's best to avoid it all together.<br /><br />The biggest reason to buy prepaid Xbox Live card is the renewal process that happens when you don't use one. If you order X-Box Live through your system, it'll renew every time your subscription runs out. This wouldn't be a problem except that it's not that easy to cancel. Instead of canceling through your system, you have to go through the hassle of actually calling X-Box Live support. Even then, depending on the representative you get, you may be hassled to keep your subscription because they really don't want you to cancel it. I'... Read more	2015-08-27

My opinion and game of the year 2015. The first hour starts off slow and the graphics look weird at first - I think this prologue part of the game may have been added in in a rush and they didn't optimize it correctly? After the prologue, you'll see the graphics are literally photo realistic and the sound is also amazing. The story is top notch and took me about 10 hours to complete.  I cannot believe how convincing the characters are. Again, do not judge the game based on the first hour or two. Once the action starts the game is a ten out of ten. Do not spoil the game by reading tons of info or watching streams! I bought a PS4 for this game and do not regret it one bit. Like I said, starts off slow but once the action starts you won't want to stop playing. Lots of replay value because all your characters can live or die depending in your choices. absolutely worth $60. I loved Heavy Rain on PS3 which played similar to this but honestly, Until Dawn completely destroys Heavy Rain on every level.<br /><br />Must. Own. Game. This is the killer (pun intended) PS4 exclusive we've all been waiting for and certainly my game of the year and generation thus far.	2015-08-27

Too bad the d-pad is godawful trash.  This would be close to a perfect controller if the designers had actually decided to design around a d-pad, instead of slapping it in a well too tall for it.  It's not as terrible as the PSP's d-pad was, but man, it is not great.  Considering that I've played, or at least attempted to play a few 2-d sidescrollers and fighting games on it, it just wasn't adequate.<br /><br />It misses directions. It constantly falls between cardinal directions and diagonals with little rhyme or reason.  And it feels mushy and nasty to use for any length of time.  It's like every d-pad come with soda prespilled inside of it.<br /><br />Which is a shame because the rest of the controller is really nice.  Solidly built, with the right amount of heft.  Feels great to hold, and all of your button and stick placement is where it should be.<br /><br />For your games that don't use a d-pad, its one of the best.  For all of your games that predominantly use a d-pad, you should probably just get another controller.	2015-08-27

I use this with Train Simulator 2015. As of now (Aug 2015) it works with all the locomotives I own in game (which is around 75% probably). There was recently a patch that fixed the issues it used to have with many of them.<br /><br />I do love it and am very glad I finally bought it, but there are a couple of negatives that prevent me from giving a full 5 stars.<br /><br />The first is that the reverser has &#34;steps&#34; in it (as does the throttle but it's not much of an issue). There are many of them to be sure, but the first one is around 9%. This makes running steamers a little awkward if you're cruising down level track and want to run at 3% reverser. It's pretty minor and I only mention it for the most picky. When I bought it, I fully expected the reverser to be just forward/N/backward, so it's really not bad.<br /><br />The 2nd issue is again fairly minor, but annoying. The decals/stickers are very poor quality. They look very good, and feel thick/heavy/good quality. However, with very little finger touching the paint/ink/whatever it is comes off fairly rapidly. I emailed them and this is a known issue. So why have they not fixed it? *shrug*  But they'll sell you a new decal sheet for 6 bucks. (Don't forget the 12 or 13 dollars shipping!!!) They'll give you the layout so you can print them yourself though. That's probably what I'll end up doing.<br /><br />The rest works awesomely and I can't imagine having to go back to driving my trains with a keyboard and mouse. I do highly recommend it!!	2015-08-27

US	17058574	R2EP5HNOJFHTEW	B00YXOYHVM	900251835	Xbox One 1TB Console - Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle	Video Games	4	4	4	N	N	Buying guide for Xbox One bundles	I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (November 12, 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spaciousand cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack and shouldn’t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven’t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.	2015-08-27

I LOVE IT! I HATE Jess, but I like that I hate her. I want Sam and Ashley to live, so I will do everything in my power to help them. That is good narrative if you care enough about someone to love them or hate them. Cheesy dialogue is intermixed with real personality and humor. The plot is intriguing and suspenseful. It is fun playing with a group and everyone helping make the decisions together. Definitely worth the money.	2015-08-27

I'm a very casual bridge player - in fact I haven't played with humans for more than 20 years - but once I got past the bewildering panoply of arcane conventions and found that the four-card-major convention in this set, which they call &#34;ACOL&#34;, was what I wanted, and set the deal options to &#34;Random&#34;, all of which took me a few tries to get right because of the &#34;unnecessary&#34; (IMV) complexity, this has been a pleasure to play.  I settled on version 14 because I gathered from my meanderings over the web that the higher-numbered versions would be even more complex to set up and<br />understand.	2015-08-27

But the &#34;ranked&#34; matches are not so even either.  On the ranked battles there's always a significant difference in skills for the team (their ranking system is not the best as it doesn't take into account how well you play but how lucky you are to have been on a good team).<br /><br />If a team member gets kicked out (it frequently happens with the Nintendo network but it's getting better) then there's no way for that team to win.

But it falls flat in almost every regard. Owned an actual vita when they first came out when sony promised AAA titles for it. But when that dream ended, so did my use of it. I sold it a few months after kill zone mercenary came out (last decent game for the console). I bought this for the sheer intent of remote playing to my ps4, especially since it came down in price so severely. So I had both my ps4 and ps tv hardlined to the same network, and to my surprise... IT SUCKED!! Terrible lag, video quality sucked, and lost connection a few times. So I packed it up and sent it back that same day. Sony needs to figure out how to make this ACTUALLY WORK.

I did not play it until 2014, and then only as single player.  It seems to me like Fallout simplified down to just fighting and weapons, which is ok.  Missions were fun, AI was not as good as in sequels.  I did not like that if you cleared an area and then stayed looting 2 or 3 minutes, the spawn-bots would respawn even right where you were standing.  Great looking world, but sort of barren of life outside the spots where the mission givers constantly stand.	2015-08-27

I almost didn't purchase this item because of some of the negative reviews mainly talking about how bad it was to play Zelda:OOT.  I have to say that I am glad that I purchased this controller.  Recognized immediately in Win7. Set up was a breeze in Project64 2.1.0.1.  I have tried it (so far) with Ocarina of Time, Goldeneye (first level) and Super Mario 64 (first level).  The controller works exceptionally well.  As for the bad reviews...perhaps Retro-Bit's quality control is lacking in some aspects and those were the unfortunate people that got bad devices.  At any rate, for the most part, any inexpensive, Made in China electronic device isn't going to be a pristine, 24k gold, heavy duty, beat the game for you device.  From unboxing, to playing Zelda perfectly fine in less than 5 minutes.  Don't expect absolute perfection and you'll be happily playing your favorite N64 games on your PC.	2015-08-27

One of the best FPS mechanics of any game so far, but MMO elements may deter long time FPS fans.  Personally I can't get enough of this game, it's addicting.  Matchmaking is not provided for much of the end game content so you have to seek it out on other sites such as Reddit, LFG and the100.io among others.  Unfortunately this is the best content in the game and you'll only get real value out of the game if you play the end-game content such as Raids, Strikes, etc.  Expansion packs are a must.  The only way to keep playing is to continue to buy DLC.  At this point in time The Taken King is about to be release so if you're looking to get into this game grab the Legendary edition so you have the base content and all 3 expansions.	2015-08-27

In fact, this waste of cartridge doesn't even come close to the original game or Double Dragon II the Revenge as far as being playable, having any fun factor, etc.<br />For instance, you get absolutly no continues. None. So don't die not even once. But good luck with that, cause the enemies are quite difficult. The editing is also terrible. Really, I can go on and on. You think DB III would be an improvement considering its a sequel, but the evidence to the contrary makes this game all that more disappointing. If you are a collector, go for it since all its good for is remaining on your shelf. Other than that, get ready for dying and terrible game-play. I'm honestly surprised how good the ratings have been from some of the people who've reviewed this game. I mean the reviews aren't great, but they are being way too nice.	2015-08-27

This is the best Tower Defence game I have played since Pixeljunk Monsters. The fact you can switch from Tower Defence into first person shooter really pushes this game over the top. As others have mentioned the characters on the front from Assassins Creed, He-Man, G.I. Joe, and Cobra are DLC but if you buy the disc version you get a code that unlocks them. Standard armies are fun enough if you don't want to spend the extra.<br /><br />This game is addictive and super fun, for this price it's worth every cent!	2015-08-27

I very often find myself researching things on my iPad and jotting down notes in my notebook. Having both a pen and a stylus in my hand at once makes things very convenient for me. I love how precise the stylus is. It really functions very well. I can select and highlight things just as easy if not easier than when I use my finger. I've also found this works wonders with my parents. My father had a hard time working my iPad earlier so I tossed him one of these. He had no issues from then on! The pen works just as any other pen. You twist and the ink cartridge appears allowing you to write. Over all this device is very light weight and quite convenient. Due to the fact there is three in this pack, I can carry one in my purse, leave one in my office and one in the living room. Perfect for me! I received this pack of styluses at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	2015-08-27

I feel the game was designed to be played with the wheel controller, but if you're like me that plays it with just the controller it might be a little frustrating if not impossible to play it right out of the box. the only solution to this problem is to google for the controller settings..you'll find plenty of options to choose from. just pick wherever works best for you..now with the proper controller settings i can really enjoy the game and have some fun..	2015-08-27

US	13252190	RI7ILNB9YEMAQ	B00EADTVLW	46618286	Microsoft licensed Energizer 2X Charging System	Video Games	1	1	2	N	Y	Product was defective from the start.  Received a few replacements after the original review.  Review has been updated.	"I've had this product for about 3 weeks now, and I just had to put a warranty claim on the product; because it was defective the day I got it.  I tried troubleshooting it and seeing if certain accessories were creating too much drain on the batteries.  After testing, I'm sure the batteries are okay, but the charging station itself is defective.  The charging stand was giving the \\\"green light\\\\\" for being full charged, when it was only, at best, slightly over half charged.  Product details state you should be getting about 40 playable hours with two fully charged battery packs (which are provided in the purchase).  After the initial charging, I may have gotten 10 hours of play time between both batteries combined.  I did have a Turtle Beach Headset plugged into the controller; but without it, I may only get between 12-14 hours between two fully charged batteries.  I bought this product because I was sick and tired of the plug-and-play chargers constantly breaking within 6 months to a year from purchase, and my battery pack (which I had for a year), was down to 10-12 hours per full charge,  So, even after a year of use and using a Turtle Beach Headset, the old battery was lasting almost twice as long.  I don't think the problem is with the batteries that are included with this product, it's something with the charger indicating that the batteries are fully charged and discontinuing the charging after the light turns green.  That part of the product is defective.  This wouldn't be a problem, if I could just hook the controller up to a USB (like you can with most of rechargeable battery packs for XBox One) to charge.  I've tried it, and all it does is plug the controller to the system, and doesn't charge it at all.  You have to use the quick charge station in this package, because the way the battery is designed and how it changes the charging port from the top plug-in potion of the controller to the bottom of the battery cover.  Right now I have a ticket in on the Performance Designed Products webpage, [...], which is where you have to put all your warranty claims and report or get help with any problems you are having with your product.  It was inconveniently marked in the fine print on the bottom of the box.  Also, for those who think they might need an instruction manual for how to operate it, there is none.  It just eludes to, on the box, that \\\\\"Red\\\\\" light means charging, and \\\\\"Green\\\\\" light means fully charged.  It's simple to figure out, but I know some people are going to want instructions of some sort.    Update: I've had 4 replacement batteries sent, and a new charger.  I'm still getting only about 5-7 hours from any of the batteries after full charging them on this charger; and the stand is the only way to charge their special batteries.  Also it takes a little over 2 hours to fully charge these batteries off the stand, which makes the fact I'm only getting 5-7 hours of play time is pretty unsatisfactory. It still only shows as slightly more than half charged when you check the batteries status, after \\\\\"fully\\\\\" charging them, on the XBox dashboard.  So it's either false advertisement that we're supposed to get about 40 hrs of play time between the 2 battery packs included, or they're not inspecting the merchandise when they leave the factory.  I'm just going to get another plug and play with rechargeable battery the next time I need to replace batteries.  The battery on that last about as long, probably longer, then the two battery packs included in this package combined.    Update: They've sent me 4 replacement batteries, and replaced the charging stand.  Still does not work as advertised.  Batteries are still charging halfway to 3/4 (even when it says fully charged) and still only giving 5-7 hours instead of the advertised 20 hours.  Not to mention, only used some of the replacements once, and now 5 of the total 6, that I received from the original purchase and replacements, will not charge at all on the charger stand.  Thisis absurd.  It's beyond incompetence and I can't even imagine it stands to measure up to even the lowest standard of quality."	2015-08-27

Shortly after we got the replacement, the other original started acting up as it would get hot and simply stop working. Now, it doesn't work and the replacement stopped working as well. I have three, black Wii nunchuks none of which work. I've requested a refund for the original purchase of the first two . . .

Order a blue and a black last week August 20th 2015, came from Amazon LLC. Package came this week Monday August 24th, and today Thursday August 27th as of writing this review, the blue which I mostly used is already failing!?! The sticks especially when used in combination in fast First Person shooter games (COD Ghosts) is failing, sticking or rather stops responding so suddenly my rifle is not moving as expected.<br /><br />So after three days - WOW! So either Sony who I already believe employs the most retards of any company are producing TOTAL crap, or this is a counterfeit controller.<br /><br />I called Amazon and reported the issue. They are today sending me a replacement, and provided a return label for this one, and will check if it is genuine upon return!<br /><br />Until the replacement controller comes, I can't play split screen with my son, so disappointing! The two controllers that I got with the system a year ago also from Amazon, worked for almost a year, even though both top rear buttons started to stick after a week!<br /><br />SONY I HATE YOU!!!	2015-08-27

US	17058574	RS7XWJS5Z7X3	B00TY9KYKE	380072729	Xbox One 500GB Console -  Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle	Video Games	4	14	14	N	N	Buying Guide for Xbox One bundles	I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (November 12, 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spaciousand cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack and shouldn’t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven’t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.  Hope you found this comparison useful.	2015-08-27

Great sound quality, love the comfort, comes with 2 cables (USB, and Audio jack) and a mini audio jack on the hand control with the 3 Gears for audio control (Game, Chat, and Bass Boost) although I just use Game volume since that's where I hear everything in general.<br /><br />It just feels polished with a sound card feeding it the audio source.<br /><br />PROBLEM: The side bars of the headset seem to break, lasted me 6 months every time and It's sad I payed for something designed to break at about 6 months of use. the Just wish I had a headset with steel suspension on the side so I wont have to worry about it breaking like these. and when I returned the headphones for a replacement I was charged 14$ on my end so add that to your price list when you buy. I strongly feel that they will break before the year ends if you use them as much as I do and no trolling on my end (NO I'm not stretching them like a child, normal everyday use.)	2015-08-27

I preordered this through Best Buy and received another Playmaker bundle with 5 MUT packs.  This was in addition to the Playmaker pack and 36 you get form Deluxe.  Opened 2 playmakers and 6 MUT packs on opening night and all I got was a handful of 50s, 60's and 2 Antonio Browns which seem to be the only Playmaker you get in these Playmaker packs.  Seriously... opened 2 playmakers and I get two identical 90 Antonio Browns.  The pack rewards are clearly fixed.<br /><br />Gameplay- Slowed down considerably from Madden 15.  All players feel like they are walking their routes instead of running.  I don't have lag, just the tempo is very slow and feels clunky.<br /><br />Defense is non-existent.  Offense can now throw a Hail Mary on 1st and 10 and with the new &#34;Y' button Aggressive catch, the receiver catches it 85% of the time.  Defense is always 2 steps behind the receiver, so every game I've played in, both myself and opponent finish with 95% completion rates.  Keep in mind this is with my Level 72 MUT team.<br /><br />Overall- A complete waste of money.  I spent 69.99 compared to what I could have had with Amazon's pre order of the Standard edition for $45.00 just for a handful of scrubs and a fixed Playmaker Antonio Brown thats in all Playmaker packs.	2015-08-27

However, it's a bit disappointing that it's more expensive than the card version, which would cost more to produce and ship, and obviously have a worse environmental impact.<br /><br />If it wasn't so inconvenient to do overseas shipping into Vietnam (and pay their outrageous customs fees), I would have gotten the card version for less money.<br /><br />In summary, this will be good for those who, for whatever reason you may have, find it inconvenient to receive the card version in the mail within a few days.	2015-08-27

However when we first got the product it was having issues charging... You'd put the controller on the station and it wouldn't be recognized unless you messed with it. I called Nyko's customer service countless times and there was only an answering machine. No answer, and no matter how many messages I left I never received a callback.<br /><br />Eventually the batteries started charging as soon as you put the controller on the station. The charge never lasted for long, but it was serviceable. Within a couple of months the batteries stopped holding a charge for more than an hour of use. Now, within a few minutes of begging the charging, the station says the batteries are charged. But, within a half hour they're both dead.<br /><br />Because if this experience I'd never buy another Nyko product.	2015-08-27

The biggest problem was that there was a massive crack in the plastic where the green pad connects to the blue pad, which almost broke upon a few strikes. It had some other minor issues as well, such as the stand's inability to hold the drumkit up for long periods of time and the fact that the entire kit was covered in some kind of white dust upon arrival. However, it's still functional, after a few tweaks, and it was pretty cheap so I suppose that's a plus.	2015-08-27

When I received it I noticed that the replacement screen felt less stiff than the original. I work in a materials lab so I decided to compare the two screens using FTIR. The original was some sort of melamine resin, but that result may have just been some sort of scratch resistant coating on the screen and not the actual screen material. The original was held in place with a styrene adhesive. The replacement screen is polycarbonate with an acrylic based adhesive. I was disappointed the two weren't the same materials but I guess polycarbonate is better than the original material.	2015-08-27

The problem is Electronic Arts (EA).  Again, it's the same football game.  The player animations are robotic.  There is some sharpness in the expressionless faces, but it really just adds to the lack of player fluidity.  New features are overstated and unimpressive.  Generally, the new pass-catching options are wasted in a seemingly half-hearted effort.  I see no difference from the old passing controls to the &#34;new&#34; controls.  More annoying Phil Simms and Jim Nance and their idiotic commentary.  It's the same dialogue as before.    I am a Franchise mode player.  The scouting is wasted energy.  Drafting is rather boring, redundant and uninformative.  It is like playing the same game as the last 5 years that I played on PS3, only there is more sharp graphics and much worse player animation.  The game tasks you as a coach or owner to do meaningless work.  The game is so gummed up with unnecessary tasks and options that when you aren't in a game (the same old presentation) it is more of a football business simulation, than a VIDEO GAME.  There is no reason that Electronic Arts can't insert some FUN aspects into a game.  Maybe some real theatre, fun development choices and cut scenes.  Some DEPTH!  We love football but we play the football video game for fun.  Electronic Arts can make it fun but they don't.  Electronic Arts are successful capitalists, but not successful game-makers.  They make money because they know how to market games, and because gamers have no other option when it comes to entire genres.  I suppose if you've never played a football video game then Madden 16 is going to be pretty good.  But if you want to play a complete football game then you are STUCK with EA Football year after year.  EA games are the only games that have ever froze.  I have grown to steer away from games that have the ugly &#34;EA&#34; on the cover of game boxes.  Of course I will play it.  As a football game fanatic, what other choice is there?  I loathe EA's need to control sports game titles.	2015-08-27

It's a football game, the new game won't feature players throwing around baseballs. It's like saying each Call of Duty game is the same because soldiers run around and shoot the bad guy.<br /><br />First the pros<br />Face mapping is pretty cool, players in game look like players in real life.<br /><br />New passing system seems to be solid. I do like the catch option though I usually forget to hit any of the buttons.<br /><br />The run game seems more realistic as you will need to follow blockers and sometimes your lineman just gets flat out beat.<br /><br />Defensively I do like that you can fight for the ball better as a db but it doesn't seem like anything else has changed there.<br /><br />There are more motion changes as players jump and fight for the ball, and the ball can be tipped into the air to get picked off.<br /><br />Cons<br />The play by play needs to be completely revamped. EA needs to get new people, even if they completely rewrite the script, no one wants to hear Phil Simms.<br /><br />If you run the no huddle, there is a good chance the defense will get called for encroachment or offsides. This is a glitch from past years and needs to be fixed.<br /><br />Player dynamics are still weird at times. Legs and arms get bent into Weird positions during tackles and it looks very painful.<br /><br />The in game Sim is not very realistic. I just simmed defense in my last game and my Raiders held the Bears to 5 yards passing and shut them out?<br /><br />Overall I like the game so far, the in game menus are a bit busy for me, the running game is kind of clunky, and not a lot of changes on defense but I have to give it 3 stars. Not too bad.	2015-08-27

To encapsulate the history - this game is like 20 years old, originally released on the xbox.  Not xbox one, not xbox 360, but the original xbox.  So, you'd think this would be 60fps.  Well guess what?  This &#34;ultimate edition&#34; is an ultimate excrement, as you are even lucky to get 30fps in campaign.  Really?  And why people still cash up money for this just baffles me.  When you look at the ps3, it released an awesome game called &#34;the last of us.&#34;  Well, that game is much more new, and ps4 could remaster that game in 60fps no problem.  So xbox one is the michal jackson of the consoles.  That is, it's meant for kids, it's not good for them, yet they still like it.  Go figure.<br /><br />Ps4 is a cadillac,  Xbone is a Michal Jackson within Christopher Reeve.	2015-08-27

I've had mine for years now and I still use them every time I play, and they're still holding up. If you've never played with gaming headphones before, you're definitely missing out. These allow you to pick up sounds that you would never imagine are going on while using your standard TV speakers. It's also nice to be able to hear both the chat volume with your friends and the game volume from your game being played through the same speaker. You can also control the volume of both very easily, which is nice. The actual mic that you talk into is also very sensitive and you don't have to be speaking loudly at all for everyone to hear you clearly. They fit comfortably on your head and they are relatively durable. The only thing I've noticed with them is that there isn't much noise cancellation coming out of the headphones, meaning that everyone and their mother can hear exactly what you're hearing while they're on your head. I've used these for music recording as well, and this was sort of a problem. Overall though I love this headset.	2015-08-27

Spongebob Heropants is glorified merchandise that's meant to tie in with the recent movie, Sponge Out of Water. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I recommend watching it if you're a Spongebob fan and/or like non-serious, over-the-top adventures. This game, on the other hand, is possibly the dullest Spongebob title ever. It makes you wonder why Activision didn't bother hiring Heavy Iron Studios to make a game similar to Spongebob's glory days in gaming.<br /><br />So let's get on with the plot, shall we? Once upon a time Spongebob and co. go to the Krusty Krab to find chaos, and then Bubbles the Talking Dolphin warps in to tell them there's trouble and they must collect book pages. The End. I'm serious. There's no real villain or anything, and spoiler alert: Spongebob's head contained the necessary missing pages the whole time. There was absolutely no effort put into the writing - The only way you'd know who Bubbles is is if you watched the movie. Here, he comes completely out of nowhere with none of his character explained -  and the cutscenes that aren't the intro and ending feature the characters turned AWAY from the camera view!<br /><br />If you long for the days of Heavy Iron's love and effort into the Spongebob games they've created, prepare for a giant smack in the face as you play through the most basic platforming levels ever that this game consists of THROUGHOUT ITS ENTIRETY. It's actually very comparable to Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, except that game looked better and made even the SMALLEST kind of effort to change up things. Here? Every level has the same super-repetitive platforming style of play. You run around, you mash the attack button to make the enemies a complete joke, press floor buttons or push blocks when necessary, grab keys to open doors, and then spend a chunk of your time figuring out why you are playing this. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />Being that this game was surprisingly made in Unity (a program normally used by indie developers), it's also kinda baffling to see that this game makes the same kind of technical flaws and performance that amateur Unity projects have faced. While Spongebob and co. control just fine, there are some glitches in the game that you'd think could easily be fixed by AAA developers, but NOPE! The blocks you push apparently have not been tested too much; if you push it off a platform, it falls down in a much slower framerate than the rest of the game, and if it's on a rising platform, collision between it and the player would result in it SINKING into the platform! DO NOT be surprised when you encounter glitchiness in this game.<br />Then again, if you know well, you know not to buy this crap.<br /><br />There are merely three worlds in total, but each one feels like an absolute drag. When the game finally decides to end a world, it does it pathetically; there are two bosses, and they are just as much of a cakewalk to beat as the average enemy. The Plankton robot in the first world executes easily avoidable attacks slowly, and all you do is hit his eye. The Squidward dinosaur in the second world simply chases after you in a short level. Lastly, the third world contains no boss. It's just Spongebob trying to wake himself up from his &#34;imagination&#34; (or lack of, in this case) via the ending cutscene. There is a &#34;Best Ending&#34; you can obtain by collecting every additional page in the levels, but many actually force you to have a friend or relative to help you collect them. The endings themselves are painfully dumb, regardless, and are definitely not worth the extra effort. Why would I collect all the pages just to watch Bubbles breakdance in front of our tarnished heroes? I shouldn't have to put in any effort if the game isn't going to anytime soon!<br /><br />Barnacles, what kind of Pinhead Larry would think something like this was a good idea? Spongebob Heropants is totally one of the worst Spongebob games I've ever played, period. If you seriously are considering to buy this for your kid(s) or something, allow me to direct you to the many other games suitable for children that are a million times better than this scam. Heck, Spongebob's Truth Or Square on the Xbox 360 is in fact created by Heavy Iron Studios, and it indeed is a good game; I mean, it's not GREAT, but it's a masterpiece compared to the soulless bottom-feeder-esc waste of a disc this title turned out to be. I only rented this game from redbox, and even then I demand a full refund.the game isn't going to anytime soon!  Barnacles, what kind of Pinhead Larry would think something like this was a good idea?

An early tragedy in the game causes the death of some characters who we are introduced to at the very beginning of the game.  After 1 year, friends decide to reunite up in a lonely ski lodge cabin, although many have clear reservations about the inappropriateness of the venue and the circumstances that befell them 1 year prior.  And that's about all the story spoiling that you'll get from me and the 8 characters who meet their fate at the hands of your own decision-making.  This game is a definite love letter to the 90's horror flick. It has a definite Scream meets Final Destination vibe to it with Butterfly Effect concepts shamelessly sprinkled into it. What makes it all the more intriguing is the &#34;butterfly effect&#34; story system. Seemingly innocuous choices--including an early choice to see who is calling your friend's cell phone when it's none of your business--affect the story further down the line. As a result, there is HUGE replay potential here. What would have happened if I left the cell phone alone? What happens if I decide to throw a snowball at a bird instead of my friend instead? A flutter of butterflies in the upper left-hand corner of the screen will briefly signal that you've made a choice that affects the story further down the line...you never know if the choice that you're making on the first playthrough is going to matter or not, but as soon as you make it, you'll know that you've chosen a fate, no matter &#34;how the hell does that affect anything&#34; may seem at the time. Add to that unusual 4th wall-breaking sessions with a doctor between &#34;scenes&#34; who asks questions about what makes you uneasy/anxious/scared and you have created an exotic mixture of &#34;what the hell is going to happen to me now?!?&#34; And there are bigger questions - the doctor is talking to you...but who are YOU??  It's somewhat surreal and even has you questioning why he's talking to you and why it even matters.  What's even MORE fun is the discovery of totems that are color-coded based on the type of event that they foretell and offer you a very brief glimpse of the future. All of these diverse elements do a great job in adding dread to the game. That, and there are clues scattered throughout the area that may/may not help you unravel the mystery of what's going on and may/may not help you save more lives literally UNTIL DAWN.  Maybe it matters...maybe it doesn't.  Maybe harming a small animal affects something.  You'll never know...until you try...and see the consequences of your various actions unfold.  Decisions also affect how people interact with you...and whether or not they'll be willing to help you later.  While the system feels obvious on the surface, how it ultimately unfolds is not unlike a Walking Dead experience as executed by TT Games.  It's fantastic fun and I can't wait to try alternative roads in the future.  If you liked Heavy Rain, you'll be in good company here....except that the game mechanics are not nearly as clunky and they feel like they make more sense. QTE moments help to ratchet up the tension and they don't feel cheap...when you're on the run, having good reflexes make sense and they don't cheapen the experience like Resident Evil 6 did, for example. So far, I'm giving it a 4.75/5. It's not perfect, but I'm dying to play it some more already...I've only scratched the surface; that alone warrants a full 5 stars for me. A game like this has been a loooong time in the making and I'm glad that it's here.  One additional note:  the score is exceptional on this film.  The song &#34;O Death&#34; will give you chills as the opening credits roll and sets the tone for the game early.  Voice acting is great and the game is very self-aware of its roots, and rolls around in its genre's playground willingly and with a great amount of fun I might add.  Enjoy the ride...it's going to be a long night.	2015-08-27

Got this for about $8 with a discount code and I'm completely satisfied with this product. If you're looking for a cheap but effective charging station, look no further. The controllers slide into place effortlessly, which is nice, and the gradually changing colors of the light bar are easy on the eyes. That said, the light can be fairly bright in a dark room, which might be distracting for some people, but you can always unplug it if that's a problem. Upon purchase, I assumed that the light bar would change from red to green to blue, which is does for a short time, but it eventually changes its pattern altogether providing an almost flowing or rolling spectrum of color.	2015-08-27

Game revolves around a group of friends who go back to an old mountain lodge owned by one of the characters a year after a tragedy happens<br /><br />If you've played Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls, and liked them, then you'll like this game. It has basically the same style game play. I'm probably about half-way through the game and I still am not sure exactly what is going on. I like that the story changes depending on what decisions you make (the butterfly effect). And also each character you play (you end up at one point or another playing each character the game revolves around, which is 8 characters, 6 of which I've played so far) has stats that change depending on what decisions you make in the game. Bravery, romantic, honest, funny, etc...and also for each character, that character has relationship stats for all the other characters that change. So your relationship with the other characters you interact with changes depending on your decisions, as well as your personality.<br /><br />It's a mystery/horror game. Some of the atmosphere reminds me of The Evil Within and the Saw movies as well as the heavy, disturbing atmosphere of Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls.<br /><br />If you don't like the action-button-timing type play, you'll hate the game probably. If you love horror flicks and games, and don't mind the lack of beating the crap out of stuff, you'll love it and it's worth a play or two.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to replaying and trying to find out how the story line changes.	2015-08-27

I really like these headphones for Xbox One gaming on Destiny and Smite.  My brother and I had Turtle Beach headsets for the Xbox 360.<br /><br />Apparently you can get some sort of converter or something that allows use of an Xbox 360 headset on an Xbox One, but I did not know that until I bough this one.  I probably would have decided to go with this either way because it was designed to be compatible with Xbox One in the first place.  I am assuming there will be better quality  and ease of use than in using the converter option.<br /><br />The headphones are comfortable and offer separate volume controls for the game and chat audio.  The wire connecting to the controller is insulated with braided material rather than something with a plastic or rubber feel.  This does draw power from the controller; but, on the other hand, it also wireless from the TV which is a nice improvement.<br /><br />You can hear your own voice as a part of the game chat audio channel.  This is helpful to prevent you from yelling (which I apparently did on the Xbox 360) and to make you aware of any annoying background noise coming from your own environment (such as breathing into the mic which I also did on the Xbox 360).  I find that really annoying, personally.  If only they had told me sooner I would have done something about it... Anyway, if you do not prefer to hear yourself, I do not think that you can turn this feature off.<br /><br />The buttons used to change the volume are really weird.  On the left, you select game or chat while on the right you increase or decrease the volume. This is difficult to use because there is no indicator as to which one you are about to adjust.  Therefore, it seems it is best to always select game or chat before increasing or decreasing the volume.  I would suggest that they put the game increase and decrease on one side and the chat increase and decrease on the other.  That way you would just know which one you were about to adjust every time based on it being on the right or left side.  Simpler is always better.<br /><br />I am happy with these headphones.  My brother bought some Polk headphones (as they enter the gaming headset market from building quality audio equipment).  He said that others struggle to hear him on his mic.  His mic can hide (slide inside the housing and click into place) when not in use.  Obviously that is way more cool than a mini microphone boom complete with its own foam cover like on this Turtle Beach, but it apparently might not work nearly as well.  In their defense, the mic on these Turtle Beach headphones does detach.  This is helpful in storage, but do not lose it!<br /><br />On a side note, I got this on Amazon Prime Day with &#34;discounts better than Black Friday,&#34; and it was an extra $5 off from the day before.  I am not sure that was worth all the hype and advertising.	2015-08-27

She has all the other Mario Party versions too, but ever since I bought her this one she hasn't gone back to the old ones. Personally, my favorite part of this is the Bonus Mode which includes ice hockey, beach volleyball and other card games, with the option to play with up to four-players. Great for kids but entertaining for adults too because of all the new features! Would definitely recommend for all ages.	2015-08-27

This Recon 530X is compatible w/ the PlayStation 4 controller & the new Xbox One controller (* you need a 3.5mm headset jack) and most PC tablets & Mac.<br /><br />It is chat ONLY when gaming, most gamers know how that works. It is an affordable way to be more fully immersed in a game as you can now communicate with others on your team .<br />It his inline controls for the mic and volume and the slotted ear cup allows it to stay cooler than most headsets at this price point.<br />The band across the headset is cushioned so you ca wear this longer without discomfort. It fits well, sounds are heard and transmitted clearly, in a nutshell it works just fine if you want to chat with others when playing a game or to others on an online chat on your tablet or PC.<br />I found this very easy to use, the mic also adjusts so I can place it where I want.<br /><br />Over all it is a good buy that has multiple uses, it is not just for gaming but it does look nice (the kids loved it) as it matches all our other Xbox  gaming items with the green accent color.	2015-08-27

I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  There doesn't seem to be a promotion for these currently (though there should be some for Black Friday). The new designation for Console with one controller and Console with two controllers just lets you toggle between the standard bundle and the bundle with an extra new controller at about full price. You'd actually save a few buck buying separately, so I wouldn't go for any of them (I don't expect any controllers, except the Elite, to be scarce this season).  A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions(I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack (excepting the Forza 6 bundle) and shouldn’t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven’t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, andtriggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller has been released to wide acclaim (modifiable professional controllers can easily go for twice as much), but is scarce at present. If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. (I think these are being phased/sold out) I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom (new, with 3.5mm audio jack) controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.  At this point, I think the best offer for the holidays for an X1 bundle will be for $50 off current price point, plus an extra game and second controller (Dell at least, will offer such a deal). The risk is availability and whether the bundle or extra game would be one you'd want.  Hope this was useful to you.	2015-08-27

US	17058574	R29OV327V7YZGV	B0118GJKIW	120888661	Xbox One 500GB Console - Gears of War: Ultimate Edition Bundle	Video Games	4	243	256	N	N	Buying guide for Xbox One bundles	I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Rainbow Six Siege includes both R6 Vegas Xbox 360 games, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it. Legacy consoles shouldn’t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven’t included, due to their rarity at this point). You may have better luck at other outlets finding the legacy consoles (Microsoft Store, Dell, various brick-and-mortar stores). There are no functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Current bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Amazon is presently offering a $30 gift card with all bundles, so be sure to select that product version (Microsoft Store is offering additional games and $75 gift card, FYI).  Rainbow Six Siege 1TB bundle. $399. Includes console, new controller, disc version of the title game and downloads of the Rainbow Six Vegas Xbox 360 games, with a chat headset. A new class-based multiplayer shooter with the excellent tactical precursor campaigns. A good bundle. A- rating.   Name your Game 500GB bundle. $349. Includes the console, new controller, a download of one of Forza 6, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Gears of War Ultimate, or Rare Replay, and no chat headset. The choice of games is nice and the selections are high-quality, but 500GB will fill very quickly at this point, and without a headset or bonus games, this is one of the lesser value bundles. B- rating.  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers, and DOES include a chat headset with a matching black and silver color scheme. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller has been released to wide acclaim (modifiable professional controllers can easily go for twice as much), but is scarce on its own at present. If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it. B+ rating. Please note that the bundle with two controllers does not include a second Elite controller, but a regular wireless one.  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage. Bundle with FIFA on separate page is even better for the same price.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Arating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only. C rating. Bundle with Forza Horizon 2 on separate page is a B rating.  Gears of War 500GB bundle (also in white). $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download. This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B- rating. This is the most discounted bundle in sales and has many other offers with it, if you can catch them.   Legacy bundles-  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel is even better, but I haven't tried it yet. Great for adults who love action adventure.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. (I think these are being phased/sold out) I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download anda year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom (new, with 3.5mm audio jack) controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Hope you found this useful.	2015-08-27

I was very excited to have gotten into the deal because my hubby needed a cooling fan for his ps4. This came on a perfect timing. Inside the box it came with the product but no instructions. Although it's pretty much self explanatory looking at it as to where to USB ports are, charging dock and etc - meaning it's a user friendly product. I like how you can put the ps4 vertically making it space friendly too. The quality is average.  According to my hubby the cooling fan is not doing so well with keeping the ps4 from overheating. We have to keep our entertainment stand open despite of having multiple holes on the back for more ventilation. We think the cooling fan needs improvement, thus the 3 stars for it.	2015-08-27

I happened to be out of town for a few weeks when this came out.<br />When I got back from my trip, I wanted to get a copy and get back to golfing with my friends from the old TW13 / 14 Country Club.<br />I was pretty surprised to see so many low priced copies on Amazon.  Less than 2 weeks after release, there were copies for $40 on Amazon.<br /><br />So I grabbed one, wondering why so many were flooding the market with their recent $60 purchases.<br /><br />Well, no alt shot, no country clubs AT ALL, very few courses and the general sterile / bland feel of this game have me understanding why people were dumping this title so fast, and for so little.  It is a surprisingly weak effort after going more than 2 years between releases.<br />There are always promises of more courses around the corner, and they have dished out Scottsdale, but that still keeps the course total in the single digits.  Granted, there are a few pretend courses, but honestly, if we wanted to keep playing pretend courses in a low feature game - we would still play The Golf Club instead of shelling out more money for this.  Even at a low price, I over-paid for this game.<br /><br />In summary, I am positive I have wasted more money on less useful things over the course of my life, so not looking to rant on minutia, but this was a pretty disappointing effort on the part of EA	2015-08-27

US	6318130	REZ2TYTQWK234	B00MB6CNN8	692074217	NES30 Game Controller - PC Mac Linux	Video Games	5	1	1	N	Y	Awesome gamepad but here's some tips to help you get started	When I finally got it working... love it.  Tactile response is perfect, no input lag, and decades old muscle memory came right back =)  It's the little things though that really make this so much fun.  The thing just looks dead on... that same weird shade of grey, the red, the size, the feel.  The box it came in looks like the old NES console which was awesome.  Even the paper the instructions are printed on is that weird off white that so many NES games came with.  Like the map for Startropics as an example; it was that same weird yellow / white color and feel.<br /><br />Not sure why I had so much trouble getting it to work.  This was my first bluetooth controller so I'll blame the difficulty on getting it working as my own fault.  Maybe my tips below will help.<br /><br /> - Turn on your android device and go to Bluetooth Options; I find turning off the bluetooth radio helps.<br /> - With the controller off hold the START button until both lights light up then LET GO!  Don't keep holding it too long or it gets confused.<br /> - This turns on the controller in MODE 1 which works in John NES, Nostalgia.NES, and other emulators.<br /> - You should see the blue LED flashing once ever second.  If you were in MODE 2, 3, or 4 it would flash 2, 3, or 4 times rapidly then a brief pause.<br /> - The controller is now trying to pair with any listening device.<br /> - Turn on your device's bluetooth radio or hit the Search button if applicable.<br /> - Should see some weird 1e:03:34:f4 type address pretty quickly.  You can wait longer and it should say 8bitdo GamePad.  Tap the address / name and it should try to Pair.  It may ask for a key; just put in 0000 and hit OK.<br /> - Your device should soon say it's paired and your confirmation is that the blue LED on the controller is solid.<br /> - You may need to change your Default input for your android device.<br /> - Go to Settings &#62; Language & Input &#62; scroll down Keyboard & Input Device sections and tap on Default.Select 8bitdo GamePad.<br /><br />Example I'll use is Nostalgia.NES.<br /> - Open up NES emulator and tap the options in the upper right corner<br /> - Hit the Preferences button<br /> - Scroll to the bottom and tap Select Input Method<br /> - Select 8Bitdo GamePad by tapping it.  If it's not listed you've not paired it properly.<br /> - Now hit Edit Profile<br /> - Go through each option you want to change.  Example:  touch UP and then hit UP on your controller... Most of them are setup already but make sure START and SELECT are for sure; I think those weren't setup right by default.  I also bound Y to Turbo B and X to Turbo A.  So I'd tap on Turbo B and then hit Y on the controller.  Binding L1 and R1 to save and load can be helpful.<br /> - Once you've made your updates hit the back button on your device.<br /> - Load up a ROM and it should work perfectly!<br /><br />Troubleshooting:<br /> Q: My keyboard doesn't work!  I tap into a text field and no keyboard comes up!?<br /> A: Your gamepad is technically an input device and probably your default one.  Simply turn off the gamepad (Hold START until both LEDs flash then let go!) and then tap into the text field again; you will get your standard keyboard back.<br /><br /> Q: I paired my device just fine a while back but I just tried it on and now my device can't connect to the gamepad.<br /> A: Out of batteries?  Ok yeah sorry ... of course it's not... Sometimes you can accidentally turn it on in a different mode.  For example I've had one of the buttons stick on me and then when I held START to turn on the device it wouldn't connect.  Took me a few minutes to notice that the blue LED was blinking twice rapidly then pausing.  That means it was turned on in MODE 2.  Turned it off, pushed all the buttons to unsticking it, and turned it on in MODE 1 and all was well.  Keep in mind you are pairing to the gamepad and the MODE; so if you turn it on in a MODE other than the one you originally paired it with then it won'twork.<br /><br /> Q: I swear I did everything you said and it still doesn't work; thanks... newb.<br /> A: Yeah I had a heck of a time getting it all working at first.  I had to &#34;forget&#34; the paired device and re-pair it I don't know how many times.  I tried all modes, the 8bitdo APP, firmware upgrade, etc. etc.  I think the real ticket was going into the Language & Input then setting my default device to 8bitdo GamePad.  That's when programs like Nostalgia.NES John NES would actually show it as an option when selecting input device /controller in their preferences.	2015-08-27

I love games that allow you explore and interact with the environment, collect items, and build a character. This game satisfies all of this and more! You can pick the life you want to lead (your job, basically), gain experience, collect items, and satisfy small quests. When you're tired of that, you can select a whole new life for your character and start again while keeping all the skills you learned with your last Life! As you gain more experience or try new Lifes, the way you interact with the game changes so you can do new things and go to new places.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because the actual story line of the game is incredibly lame and boring. BUT, you don't have to follow it much and mostly you can do what you want. Going through the different levels for each Life and gaining experience is a lot of fun and it has a ton of small tasks and quests that I found to be more interesting than the main story line. That's what gives is so much replay value.<br />I highly recommend this to people who like SIM games.	2015-08-27

If you have fast internet	In all honesty, if you have are a PC Master Race guy with a sick gaming rig but love the idea that you can play them on a massive 4K (or HDTV) in your living room and realize that consoles are very obsolete in terms of what you get out of a PC, then this is the true console killer device. I can stream any Steam Demo ( even not mentioned in the supported titles) and much more from my PC and that is cool enough for me.<br /><br />Unfortunately here is some cons:<br /><br />1. Playing fast FPS games will display some very very minor lag, so if your used to seeing the butter smooth movements on your PC monitor with fast FPS games, you will notice a slight difference. This is due to streaming but also to the TV refresh rate. In my opinion, I will play FPS games on monitor because i'm competing against PC players and you need precision.<br />2. You must have a 5ghz router, so throw away your 2.4ghz. If your less than 50mbps your wireless gaming will suffer and you wont want to play PC streaming. Best solution, hard wire through ethernet ( maybe even drill a hole in a wall and feed it through if you can )<br />3. You will notice slight quality degradation compared to your monitor during game streaming primarily always during fast paced action, slight blur while image refreshes and catches up with the wireless signal.	2015-08-27
US	45939162	R6JH9Q545SLYW	B00CX9T598	572129152	Destiny	Video Games	3	0	0	N	Y	Fun, Social Gameplay, Lackluster Story	I've been playing since a week after launch and have completed everything multiple, multiple, multiple times (you have to if you want good gear). The actual gameplay is a blast and the first raid is fantastic, but there are a myriad of issues. The story is boring, all the NPC's constantly speak in vague metaphors, the multiplayer crucible is a lag fest with cycles of unbalanced weapons, and it can be tough to find a roster of dedicated friends. All of the people I played with originally (people I knew) have quit playing. Then I found a lot of people through LFG and eventually settled into a new group. These people also quit after the first and second expansion. Now I mostly play PvP/Trials, and go to LFG to find more rando's to play with for PvE stuff. Honestly, not a great game to start up on because you'll have to grind forever to get the good gear, and let's face it - the human brain's susceptibility to addiction will keep you playing this game LONG after you finish the story or even finish playing for the sake of a good time.  As of the next expansion, I will be joining the ranks of others who have &#34;given up the habit&#34; and walked away from this game.	2015-08-27

I do really love this controller. People say its flimsy but when it is properly attached to your phone it is just fine. The buttons are solid, the analog sticks aren't bad, and the d-pad is surprisingly good. The only real complaint I have is that the trigger buttons are springy. But the real problem lies in the controllers power: when ever the battery runs out the controller has to be reset while it's charging, while only really a minor I conscience, is quite annoying. The real problem is that now it will randomly shut down in games, which is really irritating. It's a fine controller, but is severely hampered by power problems.	2015-08-27

The gameplay has been massively improved and the new WR/DB interactions make the game more realistic than ever.<br /><br />Being the Playmaker is totally in your hands. The QB you can throw passes in a number of ways such as Touch, High point, and Low Point. New WR mechanics such as Aggressive Catch, RAC catch, and Possession catch allow you to be in control of your WRs. Your user skills on defense will be tested more than ever this year.<br /><br />The new mode Draft Champions brings Fantasy Football into Madden. The mode can be played solo versus the computer or multiplayer vs other competitors. You will go through a 15 round draft to improve off of your base team. The more you play, the more you learn that some Gold players are better for you than some Elite players. You always be able to draft an NFL Legend in the final round of the draft such as Herman Moore, LaDainian Tomlinson, Ray Lewis, John Elway, Jason Taylor, Ty Law, and many more! Wins will be rewarded with content in Madden Ultimate Team. If you lose, you can begin the whole draft process over again. See if you have what it takes to be a Draft Champion.<br /><br />Madden Ultimate Team has also improved. The Journey is a chain of 100+ games and each one is a game-changing moment from a real NFL game. The Journey starts with Super Bowl XLIX and you are the Seahawks on the Patriots 2-yard line trying to rewrite History. This is just one example of the many you will face on The Journey. With all the programs, new challenges, and new legends - there is no better time to try Madden Ultimate Team.<br /><br />If you liked Madden 15 than you will love Madden 16. It provides a fantastic experience all around and is not the same game with a roster update	2015-08-27

It's very fun and even has an option to record your reaction during scary parts without you knowing so you can watch your face and laugh later.

I've been playing Elder Scroll games for years, and this one is by far my favorite. Sometimes their is nothing more rewarding after coming home from work and escaping to a different world to relieve stress. Each time you play is different. My favorite thing sometimes is the interaction with other people online. When you get to bigger cities in the game it's hilarious to hear some of the conversations people have. SUPER NERDS!

I gave it 1 star because out of the 2 battery packs, 1 still works. Both were really snug fitting onto my wii remotes. One works so far. The other broke before I got to use it. The one that broke, the metal piece that makes the contact snapped off. Disintegrated really. It was really soft metal and broke the first time I tried to install it into my remote. If you look at the photo, the one on the left is the one that fell apart. The one on the right is still intact and seems to hold a charge alright. However, I did just start using it on a regular basis. I never got to use the one on the right at all. I'm going back to rechargeable batteries in the wii remotes after this. The USB cord is really short as other reviews have mentioned but it fits perfectly in the console of my couch that has a USB port. I had high hopes that this was exactly what I was looking for. However, its only good if you want to use one remote. What better way to beat your friends at Mario Kart than for them to have a remote that doesn't work at all!	2015-08-27

I bought this in January of 2015, it is now August. First off the ONLY reason I've played Halo was for the multiplayer aspect. Multiplayer has never truly worked. Sometimes it takes 20 min to find a game. After waiting it very often boots you from the game 5 minutes later. I am hard wired with an open nat and still cannot get into a game. I wish 343 industries would take some action and fix the multiplayer problem or refund the money for this worthless disc I now own.	2015-08-27

I was roughly 8 years old when the GameCube version of this game came out, and I recall hating it as a child while I loved the N64 versions of Ocarina and Majora's Mask. I couldn't really remember why I disliked this game so much as a kid, so when I bought my Wii U, I decided to give this game a shot.  I love it.  I absolutely love it. The graphics are beautiful and the story is great and I am so sad that I spent so many years disliking this game because, man, was I missing out. I've played every 3D Zelda game to date, and a few others including LBW, ALTTP, and Minish Cap, but Wind Waker ranks in my top 3 of all time (along with Majora and Skyward Sword) now that I've played it through.  If you're considering purchasing this game, then I think you should go for it, especially if you're a Zelda fan. It's so worth it. This is such a gorgeous game, and it is so much fun!	2015-08-27

Until Dawn is a really cool adrenaline rush of a game when one wrong move can get one of the 8 characters killed. I have literally been dying for game like this since probably Friday the 13th for NES. But one with graphics and gameplay like Heavy Rain and Until Dawn definitely delivers what I was hoping for.<br />Spoiler: Except for the fact that I was hoping for a slasher game like Heavy Rain with Friday the 13th gameplay. Until Dawn turning into another game where you fight off monsters is a slight disappointment. There's enough games like that already. However, Until Dawn is one of the best of those games.<br />While if you don't like the ending and you got your favorite characters killed. You can replay the whole game or just a couple of chapters to try and get a better ending.<br />  Here's to hoping the company makes an actual slasher game with similar game play in the future. I'd pre-order that in a second. This game was still amazing either way.	2015-08-27

Like the Telltale games, narrative and player choice are front and center, but this time around the production level is very high and the term &#34;interactive movie&#34; has never been more appropriate.  I mean that in a very positive way.  It is a true blend of video game and cinema experience, and in fact the player is given more control of the character actions and movements then I had initially expected. I expect/hope this genre will continue to grow and become much more popular.  Although there are a few weird character movement animations, for the most part the motion capture animation is quite amazing, which in turn serves to highlight the strength of the cast (true, the acting and script can be over-the-top, but that comes with the territory in this genre).<br /><br />I have played through the game completely once.  I plan to play again, and it will be interesting to see the different ways your choices can alter the outcome, though I suspect that there will be diminishing returns in repeat playthroughs as it becomes more apparent which portions of the story are set in stone and how much of the choice is illusory.  Still, just the knowledge that any of the 8 main characters can either die or survive depending on how you play the game really serves to up the ante as you creep around the &#34;cabin in the woods&#34; environment.<br /><br />Combat itself isn't a large portion of the game, but when it happens it is done through quicktime events.  One twist on that concept is that sometimes it is actually best to NOT perform the prompted action (for example, there may be quicktime event prompt to perform an attack, but it may be better to do nothing and stay hidden).<br /><br />While there are things that could be improved, this game represents a big step in the genre, and I hope developers continue and expand on the experience delivered here.	2015-08-27

This game is absolutely chilling and will grip you the moment you turn it on.	This. This is the game that you need to own if you enjoy anything horror. I hadn't even heard of this game until I was browsing new PS4 games and realized that this one didn't even sound familiar to me. Honestly, I'm glad that I didn't know about this because if I had, I would be itching to play it and waiting for the launch.<br /><br />After reading many reviews about how awesome this game is, I pulled the trigger, drove to the store, bought it, and was instantly hooked. When I look for horror genre related books/movies/games, I am looking for something that will hold my attention and that is suspenseful, engaging, and realistic. This game is the perfect mix of all three of those. To top it all off, it is truly chilling.<br /><br />Just reading the description, I was instantly engaged: &#34;When eight friends become trapped on a remote mountain getaway gone wrong, things quickly turn sinister and they start to suspect they aren’t alone. Every choice the player makes while playing as each of the eight friends – even the seemingly trivial ones – will carve out a unique story. The player's actions alone determine who survives until dawn.&#34; I mean, come on, that's just amazing.<br /><br />Until Dawn is a game where player choice determines the outcomes in each chapter as well as the ending. With this being the case, you can literally play the game multiple times and have a different outcome each and every time. All I can say is give this game a shot. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are even better.<br /><br />The gameplay of Until Dawn focuses on quick time events, and discovering clues. A system is added to keep progress of all the secrets you find, which can help you piece things together. It's been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain. The player can take control of each of the eight characters, and can make simple choices which will effect the way the game plays out, resulting in deaths or other mayhem. There are over thousands of different endings possible in the game.<br /><br />I'd love to hear from anyone on how they feel the game is the further they get into the story, and I will plan on doing the same.sible in the game.<br /><br />I'd love to hear from anyone on how they feel the game is the further they get into the story, and I will plan on doing the same.	2015-08-27

A beautifully created atmosphere of horror is the best way to describe this game.  It reminded me a lot of Heavy Rain but with a different plot and setting.

It's 6-hours or so long, which is on par with similar games of this structure... but, of course, it has great replay value if you love the game because almost every action creates a different plot turn/ending.

I still go back to play it a decade later(feel so old?). The story is magnificent. While not wholly original it is told masterfully. Interaction between you and the rest of the party and even between party members feels genuine and adds a fundamental layer to the game. The reason the story and character interaction is so exquisite is due to(now be warned) a time when all dialogue did not have to be spoken. You can skip most dialogue but you are really missing an incredibly woven story. In addition, even with the old isometric top down engine the visuals are still really lively and engage you with the story.<br /><br />The combat in the game is still not properly recreated anywhere that I have seen. Though I haven't played the latest Dragon Age so maybe its there but I doubt it. The game is tactically hard basically. In the beginning fighters are the best class but towards the end of BG1 and through out BG2 mages can just obliterate an ill planned attack. The magical combat I think is similar almost to a card game in that it incorporates a kind of countering and spells don't just recharge/cooldown. You can use magical shields, but at the same time they can be dispelled(removed) so you have to choose between using another barrier or going without. And anything the game lets you do the enemy can also do if not a bit more.<br /><br />The gameplay is immensely complex once you gain more abilities for you and your party. The closest similarity I can draw is XCOM. If you enjoyed XCOM you should enjoy the game play here. It takes a long time to get new abilities though.<br /><br />Summary<br />Excellent story with characters and interactions I still find endearing but you are basically reading a small book<br />Combat is challenging when fighting high level mages and does not have cool down timers, you use abilities once then have to sleep after a fight<br />Character level progression is almost painfully slow, which is sad because its only later when game really opens up<br />If you can take the time(and read something other than tweets) its an epic master pieceater when game really opens up<br />If you can take the time(and read something other than tweets) its an epic master piece	2015-08-27

I'm shocked by how much better this unit is than the others.<br /><br />I had a Turtle Beach 800X on my original Xbox and it was a love/hate relationship. Much of the hate was that it was tied to a massive base station for charging and that it completely failed me (even with purchased converters) when I tried to move it to the Xbox One.<br /><br />For my birthday this year, my wife bought me the 500X. The offering seemed great, but it was issue after issue. After feedback through the mic, I updated it per support instructions. It then lost complete mic ability. Support then lead me through a factory reset and re-update. It worked for a week, then just plain wouldn't turn on. I returned it for a refund and cursed Turtle Beach thoroughly.<br /><br />After much research, I couldn't find a decent option, so I decided to give the 420X, which had just released, a chance. Wow, am I happy I did.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good sound and clarity<br />- It charges from any outlet with a USB adapter, so I can keep it near my sofa instead of at my console 15 feet away.<br />- There is no massive base station. It's a simple USB thumb drive sized adapter.<br />- Literally plug and play. Plug the USB adapter into the Xbox, wait a few seconds and you're on. No changing settings, no updates, nothing.<br />- The buttons are laid out well, and simple to use.<br />- All of the things the box says. It's fully wireless, has a good battery, mic monitoring, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I really haven't found any. I guess the sound could be a bit better, but that's really it. I wasn't expecting Sennheiser quality, so it met my expectations.	2015-08-27

My wife actually played this more than I did though she has little patience for some of the small side challenges. She loves the naval battles, the combat, and the whaling/sharking?. The parts of the game that require stealth, patience and a bit of dexterity with the controller tend to drive her crazy at which point she throws the controller at me and then gets mad when I complete an objective on the first or second try after she's failed it 20 or 30. I like how the map expands as you play and how the game levels up the difficulty too.	2015-08-27

They were always decent, but being a big fan or realism in the next gen systems there always seemed to be a stupid glitch, dumb animation, etc. After reading other online reviews I took the plunge on Madden 16. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />EA Sports seems to have heard most of the complaints regarding the strange, old animations, issues with the instant replay system, etc. and took a step forward to fix them. There is still the weird animation here and there but tackles, hits, they all look pretty legit now. There seems to be a lot more realism with the passing game, and to see the physical battle between receivers and defenders actually play out before the catch is really cool. The graphics are top notch, EA has taken the time to facial scan a lot of players pretty well. The stadiums, crowds etc all look really good too. Commentary is ehh, but most people don't buy Madden for the commentary. I don't play many of the modes, but from what I do play I can tell EA finally stepped up their game and didn't just make the small, incremental changes like most years. They bumped up their game, and this is the best Madden to date in my opinion.	2015-08-27

I had never played the NES game, but I knew that Capcom was the makers of the Mega Man games series which is the benchmark for side scrolling action games along with the Castlevania Series by Konomi and Metriod by Nintendo.  Bionic Commando is a very good action game for the Gameboy console. The password feature adds a lot to the replay value of the game.  It has lots of stages and content and a good story to boot.<br /><br />The cover looked pretty cool so I decided to give it a try.  The game is very unique because there is no jump button just a grappling hook that moves you around.  You swing like Tarzan and push yourself up platforms it is really fun once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />The first few stages are pretty standard and dull but once you get to the 4th and 5th stages the game starts to really pickup. You get weapon upgrades when you beat each stage and you get to pick and choose which armor to go with and what cannon to choose.  You don't have to beat every stage in the game to finish the game but it does help.<br /><br />The challenge is pretty good.  Your younger players below 12 years old could get frustrated and give up on the game to early.  You do have to use some strategy and master the swinging technique. You will have to tap enemy communications throughout the game to access doors and so on.  Several of the mutant bosses are difficult and put up a good fight. Often the biggest challenge in the game is grappling your way through difficult sections like the hooks in stage 7. Or reclaiming your weapons after getting captured in stage 10.  And above all the final section going underneath the Albatross engines.<br /><br />The Story is pretty interesting rescuing Super Joe and taking out a super air fortress called the Albatross.  The last major boss reminded me a lot of Mega Man X Sigma's big robotic form which came out several years later. The last stage is cool trying to race the clock to escape the Albatross.<br /><br />If you enjoy side scrolling action games you will like this game.  It has a futuristic setting and takes about an hour to an hour and a half to complete.  The password save feature is a little bit too long but it is a blessing being able to save your progress.  The game gives you lots of continues and you will die a lot later in the game but it is rewarding once you beat it with a nice feeling of accomplishment.<br /><br />Gameplay: 7/10<br />Play Control: 8/10<br />Story/Originality: 9/10<br />Challenge: 9/10<br />Replay Value: 7/10ool trying to race the clock to escape the Albatross.<br /><br />If you enjoy side scrolling action games you will like this game.

Best part is that the game is hella long. so the goty comes with a second disc that has about all dlc's (except for costumes) this makes the game very worth gettinf because the add on content is crazy... its a whole lot. Theres hundreds of thousands of different weapons (each has its own feel) some guns are weak others are better. theres a leveling system to where you actually do feel that you have leveled up theres also some bonus stats that can boost up specific things on your character like gun accuracy, melee damage, maximum health, etc. the game also has a somewhat perk system where you unlock these certain skills (well more of a skill tree) that gives a boosts to your character (these things are important and they all help you along as you gain experience points and level up, fighting tougher enemies. The games world is just gnarly, it really makes you feel thst your in there. The story is pretty decent you will somewhat lose track of the story due to side quests youll be doing here and there but its okay each main mission will remind you where you are at. All the characters are exciting and intresting even the enemies in the game. This game is truly a gift from god. Minor complaints are that there isnt a wholw lot to customize on the specific character you pick. There will be certain parts where the game gets tough but once you level up you will often change weapons you use since they will become weaker on stronger enemies youll face but every good gun in the game (that isnt a common weapon) feels right as you see your enemies takig alot of damage. honestly this is a good game and after playing one of the dlc's and finishong the games main mission there is still a whole lot to do (and im barely at level 33) if your lookig for a game that doesnt cost alot and is very long and fun you really need to get this quickly whether new or used.	2015-08-27

I remember playing this game in my youth, it was challenging at times but the grind was always worth it, this game has a pretty damn good roster in my opinion with around 30 (playable characters) including legends e.g. Andre the Giant, and Bret &#34;the Hitman&#34; Hart, including these two legends there are several more of whom are unlocked with in-game money at the shop. The story mode requires you to create a wrestler so you can climb the ranks, it also had quite a duration on it as well. There are several game modes from: bra and panties to TLC, and which are all very fun.	2015-08-27

I bought this game on a complete whim, knowing nothing about it or the Zero Escape series. Little did I know that I was about to play one of the most beautifully constructed puzzle-solving mystery games of all time. Everything about this game is brilliant, from the complex puzzles, to the unique art design, and amazing voice acting. What REALLY makes this game worth buying though is the story. Each decision you make in the story will take you down a different &#34;What if?&#34; path, all of which share certain events but are unique enough to make replaying certain parts absolutely worth it. The ending also has one of the craziest plot twists I've ever seen in any sort of entertainment, be it a video game, movie, or book. Overall, this game is as close to perfect as a puzzle-based game can get, and it's one of my all-time favorite games.	2015-08-27

The voice chat thing is a little annoying, I don't really like that environmental resources are first come first serve, and the story starts like the other ES games where you are in some way the chosen one.

Devs missed a lot--when they shouldn't.  trying to aim from cover often results in peeling you off the wall instead.  The blind fire itself, if you're trying to pull compound actions is pretty unpredictable.  It's really watered down the complexity of what a player can do.  For example, wanna pull off a headshot around the corner from cover and then horizontally jump away?  Good luck executing, maybe 2 of the 3 will happen, jumping--not aiming, maybe jumping and pulling of the shot in some random order.  I don't know if it's my connection but at a solid 55mb down and 5 up--I should be good.<br /><br />Everything multiplayer is sad.  Matchmaking is atrocious and takes terribly-long.  King of the Hill (annex) only lasts 1 round.  Expect about 5 minutes between multiplayer matches (finish-to-next-start).  Oh and if you make it to the finish screen after a match--the screen is locked.  You cannot exit until the next screen loads (maybe 45-60 seconds later).<br /><br />grenade physics respond as though you're shotputting a 16-lb bowling ball.  Unless you deliberately hold L-trigger to actually bolo throw the grenade--good luck getting it farther than 2-feet from you.  (use at your own peril)<br /><br />The gnasher seems to be its old self (finally a praise) but hip firing is very deceptive because if you use the direction of the shotgun as an indicator--you will be horribly misled and it's intensely counterintertuitive to fire at the center of the screen--ignoring the direction the muzzle is pointing.<br /><br />This is my favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.  I have all but sworn off video games due to the gloomy and uninspired video game culture that seems to be trending and I was hopeful for this but sorely disappointed with the rerelease.<br /><br />It is what it is and it's still a lot of fun to play multiplayer sans the looming flaws aforementioned.<br /><br />the campaign is the same as the PC version so there are extra chapteres compared to the original 360 version.<br /><br />graphics look great but the feel is off...especially hipfiring the gnasher.favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.

Price	Ok, so I'm going to go and make a guess here why some of the mainstream media sites gave The Order average to bad reviews. Price. At $60, gamers today expect to be entertained for 200+hours, especially in the shooting genre. You need to have multiplayer, new game plus bonuses, harder and harder difficulties, etc...and this is likely just too barebones of a game for today's new generation of gamers. For me, I don't have time to sit down with 10-15 games for over 100 hours. Those games I sit down with that long are thoughtfully chosen, and few and far between. For me, I agree that The Order is too short, but I still rate it very highly. The game is not bad, it simply may not be the value proposition at $60. For you, maybe it's $40, or $30, but to say the game is terrible, well, I feel it's extremely disingenuous to the devs at Ready at Dawn.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />- Well crafted and acted Story, that continually gets more interesting<br /><br />- Beautiful aesthetics and atmosphere, playing around with the photo mode and colors themes really highlight how beautiful the game is<br /><br />- No hud or menus really add to the story progression and gets you engrossed in the game. I put headphones on and had a really really great 3 hours session. Was completely engulfed in the story after the mid way point.<br /><br />- Really fun, visually pleasing weapons, that honestly, I wanted to play more of<br /><br />- There simply isn't enough mechanics in the game. Linear story-telling is perfectly fine for what they are trying to accomplish here. But a basic progression system, more back story, collectibles, etc...would have broadened the game's appeal.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- You can tell this is the team's first step into the big AAA title space. The Order is really basic and simple. Sometimes, that simplicity is absolutely beautiful, but sometimes it leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />-Pacing could be better as well as more gameplay variety<br /><br />-This gameplay engine is just begging for multi-player modes, horde modes, and other co-op experiences. Really, there's a lot more Ready at Dawn could have done with this engine, it seems kinda rushed out the door. The SP was well done, but it is a very barebones games, that at times, have to count as somewhat negative.<br /><br />At $20 and $30, it's really hard to knock The Order though. It's still one of if not the most visually stunning PS4 games on the market, and at times I felt like I was playing Gears of War on Playstation lol. Not sure we'll ever get a sequel, but this one is full of potential. Go and play it now if you like playing through a solid story and third person shooting.ay engine is just begging for multi-player modes, horde modes, and other co-op experiences.

For those who do not know, this is a sort of port of a free to play mobile game onto the 3DS. I say sort of port because quite a lot was changed. The biggest of which is the removal of all the micro-transactions and the nonsense that business model spawns. So things like timers, &#34;premium&#34; currency, and lottery machines are gone. That alone is a major improvement.<br /><br />However, on top of that they also added in a basic story line to the game. It isn't anything special, but it might be that little extra something to motivate you to continue with the game.<br /><br />As a bonus, there is a entirely separate second game included that is themed on the Mario universe. This one seems more basic though. The mechanics all seem easier to understand, and when you start up the game it recommends you start with this version if you're new to the Puzzle & Dragons gameplay. However, I've found that it ramps up in difficulty far more sharply than the regular game. Regardless, you can play either or and your progress is saved separately so there is no harm in trying either out.<br /><br />I'd say it's a good value. You get two games in one, and there are none of those awful micro-transaction shenanigans in it. The story is simplistic/boring, and it still retains its match-three gameplay you may have seen on your phone. It's a good time waster, best played in small doses at a time.	2015-08-27

The fit, finish, and feel of these controllers is top notch.  These were bought in addition to the XB One for my sons birthday and have now gone through hours of use and abuse with no issues.  Even when thrown in frustration by my son or friends, they have not missed a beat.  Having the new 3.5mm jack is nice as well although it's seen no use as of yet.  My son also very much likes the Covert Forces graphics which seem to be of high enough quality as to not rub off or deteriorate.  Very happy with this purchase overall.	2015-08-27

I have had to purchase two Wii U game pad charger cords since we have had the Wii U. The first one just wore out and the replacement cord got tripped over. The part of the cord right by the box immediately had a shortage in it after that. If you have a house full of kids that are hard on their accessories, I think this is a great buy. The continuous battery purchasing problem is solved and you don't have to keep buying those Wii U charger cords anymore. With this device, the cord can be plugged up safely behind a TV stand or dresser so it is out of the way. The remotes have batter charger packs that meet up with the chargers on the station. The Wii U game pad is plugged up and charged on the device. I think the money I spent was worth it.	2015-08-27

Before I begin this review I must clarify I am not a fan of adventure, point and click, interactive sort of games. A good example on how these sorts of games can be considered mediocre and boring, just play one of David Cage's games and you will know what I mean. With the exception of Tell Tale Walking Dead Series. Usually games like the Beyond Two Souls and Indigo Prophecy in my eyes are mediocre.<br /><br />Now I will not bore you will a long review, and state the many accomplishment Until Dawn has in it's game. But instead I will explain my reasoning on why you should purchase this game and enjoy the many wounder for yourself.<br /><br />1. It's not a corny and goofy wanna be game; as I first thought when i saw the trailer for it. To its core the game provides moments of great suspense and interesting view point on how the game will develop throughout your session.  Moreover for the most part (except for 2 characters) the cast of Until Dawn are a likable bunch with their unique features to like and dislike.<br /><br />2. I am going to be honest with you if you are a fast paste, FPS, MMO, MOBO, or RTS type of gamer (like me), this game will not quite satisfy you because its an exploring game as well. Therefore you must set your mind in a way an RPG player might have who enjoys exploring and immersing yourself in. If you get that mind set you will start to enjoy the game, if you are stuck with a fast paste mind set you might hate the game or struggle through it.<br /><br />3. Simple to the point, it has many choices and they do weigh a great deal through the game. The choices in Until Dawn are not like some other games I played in which you might think it will impact the game progression but in reality it does nothing.  (I'm looking at you Dragon Age Inquisition)<br /><br />4. Finally I would say you will get your moneys worth, I beat the game in about 18 hours in a relax paste, and I have no regret spending 60 dollars on it.  So I would say you should buy the gameand enjoy the game charm. Thank you for reading and sorry for my poor English I am not a native speaker.	2015-08-27

I don't normally write reviews, but I felt like I needed to counteract some of the troll reviews which are not about the game, and are really dumb,(look at the one star reviews you'll see what I'm saying,) but I digress. So Until Dawn is a cinematic story driven adventure horror game with multiple endings and a dynamic story and very well done (motion captured)characters. The graphics are amazing and due to the choices the player makes, you will not be able to see nearly everything in one time playing it. If you like Heavy Rain, The wolf among us, etc. you will most likely enjoy this fantastic game very much. Thank you for reading my review.	2015-08-27

In the 90's you had Sega & Nintendo competing for superiority & in the meantime you had these other companies such as 3DO as well as Atari attempting yet another comeback. 16 bit gaming couldn't go on forever Nintendo on 1 hand was smart they chose to only stick with system while working on a future system. Meanwhile Sega had add on's to try to get more mileage out of The Genesis while I like The Sega CD I will admit it was a failure cause of it's price & wasn't marketed well. Sega having The 32X about 6 months before The Saturn was due to come out hurt their credibility with the public as well retailers got tired of it. In the early to mid 90's The Genesis-Mega Drive did was very popular & had bested Nintendo on a couple of occasions so why they didn't just stick with The Genesis in 1994 & 1995 is beyond me cause it was still popular. In 1994, 1995 & 1996 Nintendo was clearly the winner with it's SNES cause they could do games with The FX chip & you didn't any add on's plus the games that came out were better & better. The Sega Saturn I believe is a totally underrated 2D powerhouse I mean so many arcade games like all The Street Fighter II versions & Street Fighter Alpha were arcade perfect. X Men vs Street Fighter was rcade perfect as well as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 a very solid near arcade perfect port. Sega Of Japan wanted a system theat would flawlessly deliever arcade to home ports of games like Virtua Fighter & Daytona USA. In The US Kalinske wanted to get a deal with Silicon Graphics to create a graphics chip Sega Of Japan didn't like it as well in 1993 Sega was working with Sony after their deal with Nintendo fell through Sega wanted The Saturn to have both 2D & 3D graphics chips Sony wanted it to be strictly 3D & Sony went off & made The Playstation.On November 22nd 1994 The Sega Saturn was released in Japan it sold at 44,800 Yen. 200,000 units were sold in the 1st day of release. On December 3rd of 1994 Sega sent out more units cause on that day was The Japanese launch of The Sony Playstation The Saturn sold between 400,000 & 500,000 units The Sony Playstation sold 300,000 units in Japan. Although Sony would take the lead in 1995. In America Tom Kalinske announced that on September 2nd 1995 it would be Saturnday meaning it would be the launch of Sega Saturn in The United States. Sega Of Japan however mandated an early launch to give The Saturn an advantage. At the very 1st E3 in May of 1995 Tom Kalinske gave a presentation of The Saturn. It would be priced at $399 it would be bundled with Virtua Fighter a big hit in the arcade then Kalinske laid the hammer down & said \\\"It's now available at Toys R Us, Babbage's Electronics Boutique & Software ETC.\\\\\" As well they had 30,000 units sent out. Now other retailers like Wal Mart, Best Buy & KB Toys weren't happy & they weren't in on the surprise & they didn't sell Sega Products for awhile. Which Sony turned around & sold The Playstation for $299.  The Playstation was released on September 9th 1995 & it sold more units than The Saturn even with the 4 month headstart The Saturn had. Namco who had worked with Sega for awhile went with Sony they ported games like Tekken & Ridge Racer to The Playstation cause it was easier to work with. I did go into all the technical specs of The Saturn in my retrospective of system on The Gamer Forum & why it was a harder system to program for plus I go into why Sonic Xtreme never came to be as well I talk about SNES & Genesis still being popular despite the fact there were 32 bit consoles on the market & then I go into Tom Kalinske leaving & Bernie Stolar coming in & putting Sega out of it's misery. Bernie Stolar basically came to from Sony to Sega the company saw him as an asset. Stolar didn't want Japanese RPG's & space ship shooters. He didn't think they represented the system well. Capcom had put lots of games out for The Saturn however in The States we never got a 4 MB RAM Cart I went in depth with what that did in my retrospective. The US never got games like Raident Silvergun or Lunar & why Street Fighter Alpha 3 or X Men VS Street Fighter never got a port here in The States.Bernie Stolar had this 5 star games policy to assure The Saturn would get quality games. Games that didn't get a score of 90 or more would have to reworked or dropped plus Sega Of Japan called a lot of the shots too when it came to what we'd get. I went into the issues between Stolar & Working Designs. At E3 1997 Bernie Stolar gave a speech he said  \\\\\"The Saturn is not our future.\\\\\" He was focused on a 6th Generation Console so after only 2 years in The US The Saturn was on it's way out. Which doing this really damaged Sega. I'm not hating on The Saturn cause I love Sega The I had a Genesis before I ever owned a Sony console this is more about logic cause it's a shame this couldn't have been a 2nd place system or even just a strong 3rd place system. it's a great system I bought a Sega Saturn back in 09 I've owned it for 6 years it's not failed at all compared to PS1's that die as well The Nintendo 64 lasted for 12 or 13 years. So The Playstation in terms life span isn't a great & wonderful console. What I'm saying Sega just made so many bad decisions after The Genesis-Megadrive. The Dreamcast came out in 1999 I never owned 1 & 1 of these days I might invest in 1 cause that system did do well early on it was crushed by The PS2 add to the fact Sega screwed up so many times. I've heard so many good things about The Dreamcast a lot of the games look great. In Early 1998 Sega got rid of all stockpiles Saturn's by selling them for $110 & games for $10 some retailers sold it for $75 & games for $5 which I'm sure all the good games went bye bye quickly.  Some games on TheSaturn these days cost anywhere between $25 & $350 . In The US The Saturn only sold 2 million units 1 million in Europe & 7 million in Japan as it was more popular in Japan. Most people do praise The Sega Saturn as a great 2D system I you have some really solid to great games that came out in The US as well imports.<br /><br />Here's some of the games I have for The Sega Saturn<br /><br /> Tomb Raider this was a frustrating game I know a lot of people love Tomb Raider I just didn't care for it.<br />Street Fighter The Movie The Game yes a game based off the movie based off of a game it's a good game outside of the main Street Fighter series.<br />Shinobi Legions a great game it's true to The Genesis Shinobi games. Pretty much shows off The 2D power of The Sega Saturn. Plus play it with The Shibobi X soundtrack it's awesome.<br />Die Hard Arcade this was a fun game although it was short it can be beaten in 20 minutes. Great game if you have a Asciiware Arcade Stick.<br />King Of Fighters 97 I remember this being a really good game not played it in 5 years or so.<br />Street Fighter Collection it has Super Street Fighter II & Super Street Fighter II Turbo classic fighters asciiware stick is great for this game as well Streeet Fighter & Street Figthter Alpha 2 great games classics Asciiware Stick is a must.<br />Capcom Generation 5 this is basically a compilation disc of Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Champion Edition & Street Fighter II Turbo again great games.<br />Guardian Heroes this was a well made game it's hand drawn there's different paths the game play is<br />good from what I remember this game was like $113 it's expensive & fairly rare if you know Japanese then hey go for The Japanese version of Gurdian Heroes cause it's significantly cheaper. More than likely this would be my favorite Saturn game.<br />Alien Trilogy a 1st person shooter it's a 3D game it shows off why The Saturn wasn't good at 3D however the game itself was solid basically you take the original trilogy loosely base it off of it & make a Doom clone.<br />Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 solid port of The Arcade game great game the slow down adds more of a gore effect during some of the fatalities. Once again I use The Asciiware Stick.<br />X Men vs Street Fight all I have to say about this Asciiware Stick & this game equals a perfect port.<br />Street Fighter Zero 3 now this game is the star of my Saturn collection cause Street Fighter Alpha 3 is my favorite Street Fighter game. I can't fault this game it's better than The Playstation version & well Asciiware Stick makes it even better.<br />I'll review some of these games & if you want a full in depth retrospective of this very underrated system then I'll leave a link to it in the comments."	2015-08-27

I was very excited to have a white controller and loved it right out of the box.  Now that I have been using it for a month, I can say that it does have enough issues to prevent it from being a 4-5 start purchase.<br /><br />The charge - I play maybe 5 hours a week on a good week, so I'm a casual gamer.  I fully charge this through the week and when I plan on gaming, the charge is down within 6 hours or less of active use.  I used to be able to use my PS3 controllers for over a week or more without having to plug them in.  I can't play two full nights in a row for 2-3 hours without swapping controllers.<br /><br />The L3 button sticks, or doesn't register at times.  My left thumb hurts for days after playing from having to hold the button down so hard in order for the button to register.<br /><br />An occasional delay has started popping up from between when I push a button to when the character reacts.  I don't mind much but a serious gamer might be very upset at this.<br /><br />For me it works, though a longer charge and sturdier buttons would be what it would take to make this a 5 star product.	2015-08-27

Product arrived and works as advertised.<br /><br />Head size is 7 5/8's and so this is slightly snug. I'd say my cranium size is the limit for this item, so those who possess bigger noggins beware! The volume dials are finicky - as I dial, it will have dead spots where I only hear silence before getting bum rushed by tons of volume. Or no volume. Either way.<br /><br />I can hear others in the room with me when I game, but it's not annoying - rather it's good if you need to have some awareness of pets or children getting into trouble. The mic pics up sound well, and the voice monitoring function works but it's hard to tell if it's picking up other noises which are the bane of gamers, such as breathing, smacking of lips, chewing...if you're a squeaker, it will not fix that.<br /><br />I'd buy again, especially if you're not willing to make the jump to surround - which honestly, I'm not missing since this stereo sound is good enough.	2015-08-27

EA developers have gone on record to advise customers to not start their &#34;Connect Franchise&#34; (Franchise Mode) until the next patch comes out, as the mode has multiple game-breaking bugs.  Patch timeline?  'No more than six weeks'.<br /><br />My advice?  Wait six weeks and buy the game on sale.  It's incredible that year in and year out, EA ships a game as popular as Madden with game breaking bugs.  Poor quality control and, it seems, an anemic beta testing program.<br /><br />Wish I could strongly recommend this title - I am a football nut and am EA's core demographic.  Thumbs down for now....wait until it's a finished product.	2015-08-27

The gameplay has been massively improved and the new WR/DB interactions make the game more realistic than ever.<br /><br />Being the Playmaker is totally in your hands. The QB you can throw passes in a number of ways such as Touch, High point, and Low Point. New WR mechanics such as Aggressive Catch, RAC catch, and Possession catch allow you to be in control of your WRs. Your user skills on defense will be tested more than ever this year.<br /><br />The new mode Draft Champions brings Fantasy Football into Madden. The mode can be played solo versus the computer or multiplayer vs other competitors. You will go through a 15 round draft to improve off of your base team. The more you play, the more you learn that some Gold players are better for you than some Elite players. You always be able to draft an NFL Legend in the final round of the draft such as Herman Moore, LaDainian Tomlinson, Ray Lewis, John Elway, Jason Taylor, Ty Law, and many more! Wins will be rewarded with content in Madden Ultimate Team. If you lose, you can begin the whole draft process over again. See if you have what it takes to be a Draft Champion.<br /><br />Madden Ultimate Team has also improved. The Journey is a chain of 100+ games and each one is a game-changing moment from a real NFL game. The Journey starts with Super Bowl XLIX and you are the Seahawks on the Patriots 2-yard line trying to rewrite History. This is just one example of the many you will face on The Journey. With all the programs, new challenges, and new legends - there is no better time to try Madden Ultimate Team.<br /><br />If you liked Madden 15 than you will love Madden 16. It provides a fantastic experience all around and is not the same game with a roster update	2015-08-27

The sound's good, and the drain on the battery isn't so bad.  It may only reduce the playtime of a fully charged controller battery by a couple hours.  The headset is kind of heavy on the head.  I still haven't gotten used to it after a month, but I was using simple headsets prior to this purchase.  The Mic is super sensitive, and you may not realize it until someone says something, but everyone can hear just about everything that is going on around you.  They can hear you hitting your buttons, a distant fan, or your AC if it's moving air in your direction.  Usually, those people that complain about it, are also using Kinect Mics which feeds back on everyone.  Other issues I had were when I had to recharge one controller and move the headset to another.  For whatever reason, even if you assign both controllers to you, if you have to switch it will unassign you from the new one and the headset with fail to work.  You maybe able to hear the game, but it mutes you completely.  You basically have to hardwire your controller to the system, reassign controller to you and update controller (even if it says it's already updated), and pull the plug to un-hardwire the controller so it flashes off and on.  For whatever reason, canceling party, chat, whatever and re-entering doesn't work.  Same thing with shutting down system and restarting or turning the controller off and on.  Even unpluging the mic and re-plugging it in won't work, which some say is a popular fix.<br /><br />Some may have problems with the audio settings.  Some times they seem to adjust themselves.  I've noticed it more with chat.  You'll get on and everyone will sound distant or extremely soft; when you got off the time before everyone sounded fine.  You then have to re-figure game and chat volumes, which can become a little bothersome.<br /><br />I also do agree with a review I saw earlier, it does make your head sweat; especially around the ears.  You'd probably want to keep your room at 74 degrees or cooler; otherwise it can get a bit uncomfortable to wear.ler; otherwise it can get a bit uncomfortable to wear.	2015-08-27

I bought it after I accidentally dropped my new 3ds xl and it got it's very first tiny scratch. I wanted something beautiful but would also protect it from scratches. The case is fairly rigid and snaps on. It fits well but is slightly loose and creaky by the charging port - the bottom portion only. I've only had this for a few hours so I'm unsure how it will hold up long term. The design is raised and doesn't seem like it would scratch off easily. I don't think it's quite worth the $28.99 that I paid, but the lack of decent cases made for the new 3ds xl is lacking. I only say that because it seems like a lot to pay for a simple hard plastic case with a design on it. But after reading reviews on all the other available cases, this was the most close to what I wanted. The packaging is Japanese, just so you know, so are the instructions - just if you can't figure out how to put on a simple case, you're in more trouble than what I can help you with!	2015-08-27

I guess because by then everyone else stopped playing because they were bored with it already.  As much as I played Skyrim, I still find Skyrim to be vastly more interesting and entertaining.  This game is just boring.  I wander around aimlessly and pick things up for people.  The missions or more like chores and busywork; so repetitive and pointless.  There's an incentive to spend real money on crowns in the hope that you can buy something more interesting, which I'm glad I'm not stupid enough to do.  I already was dumb enough to pay full price for the game.  I got so board that I starting a killing spree.  Skyrim had depth and intricacies that ESO isn't even close to.  Not to mention the graphics are slightly worse than Skyrim.  I know we should never trust a trailer to show real gameplay, but there was a hope that the XBone would give something more than what the 360 did.	2015-08-27

I did do a retrospective for The Sega Saturn on the gamer forum plus just an overview for that system. Street Fighter Alpha is great fighting game especially on Saturn cause The Saturn did 2D very very very well & it was usually arcade perfect when it came to these 2D fighters. Not just that just the regular Sega Saturn Controller was perfect however The Asciiware Arcade Stick is great as well. The art style went to anime which I didn't mind it added to the game. Pulling off special moves is the same as Street Fighter II. The game is a prequel & what I consider the real Street Fighter 1. The plot is straight forward as you can get which works this is a fighting game each character has their own story such as Ryu who is being hunted down by Sagat who has hatred for Ryu cause he beat him in a fight & scarred his chest much like the beginning of The Street Fighter II Animated movie. Which instead of fighting M Bison at the end you would fight Sagat same thing if you playthrough as Sagat. Let's say you playthrough as Ken then you're final battle would be against Ryu as most Street Fighter fans know they're friends but have friendly rivalry where Ken wants to defeat Ryu since he's considered the best in the world while Ken is The US Karate Champion. There's also the introduction of Charlie who is of course Guile's friend which some people didn't like Charlie & just say he might as well be Guile while some like Charlie more to me I like them both plus Charlie's a powerhouse. Playing as him you're tracking down M Bison who will be the final battle. You with a trick you can do on the character select screen you play as M Bison & play as Akuma. Which I also like Akuma cause he's more powerful than Ken & Ryu. Playing through as M Bison you'll face a new character Rose. Playing as Akuma you face M Bison. I like Ryu, Ken & Sagat in this Charlie is really good. M Bison is ok Akuma is great. There's new character's such as Rose as I mentioned you Adon who was a student of Sagat's. Dan who is a joke character. Some Final Fight characters are in this game like Guy plus you can see some of the characters in backgrounds of certain are from Final Fight. I already mentioned Charlie was new you have Sodom from Final Fight in this game as well & finally Birdie. So this game is a lot of fun with really good to great control's learning to be a defensive fighter in Street Fighter is just as important as going on the offensive to me anyway. Cause you can get backed into a corner & you'll need to know when to attack kicking, punching & tripping the opponent & when to do a jump attack. Plus it is a good idea to learn the super moves where you do 2 quarter circles & press an attack button it's required but it helps cause if you use it & the opponent is not blocking well you can do a decent amount of damage. But when I was playing this I kept coming back to play it it's a lot of fun & if you've never played Street Fighter before & are interested into getting into these games Alpha is a good start cause it's very user friendly meaning it's easy for anyone to pick up & play & it was ported to more than just The Saturn & Playstation if you have MAME then you play the arcade version if you spot the actual arcade machine somewhere put few quarters or coins. It's on PS2 as part of The Alpha Anthology which has Alpha 1, 2 & 3. I believe The XBOX 360 & PS3 have it available on their store's. I recommend for fullest enjoyment get a fighting controller or an arcade stick. Next review will be for Street Fighter Alpha 2.	2015-08-27

US	18176251	R2FAARI3JQO9XQ	B00VFT4T5M	936171118	New Nintendo 3ds Only Fire Emblem If Special Edition Japan Import	Video Games	5	29	30	N	Y	Special Edition Items and Overview	**You must have a 3ds that can play Japanese games as these games won't work on a NA 3ds as the 3ds is region locked.**  This review will be for the items you can only recieve in this special edition and aren't available in the seperate copies of Fire Emblem If. To see seperate opinions on these games please check their seperate pages for detailed information, but I will give slight input on each title included without trying to spoil anything.  In this box you will be recieving  -3ds copy of White Night/Dark Night Kingdom aka Birthright and Conquest in the West (Both games on one 3ds cartridge)  -2 Fire Emblem Cipher TCG cards Lucina and Marth (These are promotion cards and have special artwork not available anywhere else)  -Hardcover artbook featuring pictures of characters,settings,items etc  - Invisible Kingdom is also included as a download on the cartridge itself and a code isn't required!  How long are these games?  After beating the Hoshido and Nohr copies of the game I can tell you that it should take 30+ hours to beat each copy. These games have high replayability though and you can always replay the game using characters you didn't even try from the previous playthrough. Also when a character dies during a battle you'll want to reset (like I did) unless you're using the new Phoenix mode feature which lets a character respond the following turn.  I don't speak Japanese should I get these?  If you've played prior games in the Fire Emblem series (especially Fire Emblem Awakening) then this game will be perfect and won't give many problems playing through it. If you want to understand the story and see what is going on during the chapters or read support conversations much of the game has been translated into english and can be viewed on sites like Youtube or SerenesForest.  If I don't want the special edition which game should I get White or Dark Night Kingdom?  If you like being able to farm experience and max out supports with all your characters then White Night is the way to go. Dark Night plays more like earlier Fire Emblems (7,8,9) in that you can't go farm experience and money is harder to come by. You must chose your weapons and character growths carefully to get the most out of your characters. Both include normal,hard,lunatic difficulties so it really doesn't matter if you think the Dark Night Kingdom will be more of a challenge it's really just a matter of choice and strategy on your part. Do you like Japanese of European influenced character types? This should be the question you ask yourself when you pick a copy.  What's new with these games?  Just off the top of my head the Phoenix mode I mentioned earlier is new to the series and will help people who just want to experience the story and not have to reset the game when one of your unit dies from a 2% chance hit from the enemy (crazy but this happens to me quite a bit haha). New classes are introduced like the Puppeteer,Ninja and Oni Savage on the Hoshido side while the Nohr side has familiar classes like Warrior,Paladin,General and Beserker. Weapons no longer degrade and have unlimited uses, except staves of course. With this comes a new system where a brave sword may be used forever, but will lower the characters defense while they wield it.  Another new system is the support system being upgraded to where a character can have a &#34;S&#34; support marrying another and having a child and a &#34;A+&#34; support which will let the character change class into a class the other character has. The weapon triangle has been revamped as well including 2 weapon types at each point of the triangle like swords and magic beating axes and bows while axes and bows beat lances and hidden/concealed weapons.  Finally new features like My Castle (build your own base) and Skinship (rub characters to gain support).  Will some of the content in these copies change before release in the West?  The major thing that will probably get censored on its way to the west is the newskinship feature which is like Pokemon amie, where you pet characters with the stylus to raise support. It sounds weird, but honestly it's nothing dirty...other than some of the stuff the characters say while getting their forehead rubbed. Ages of some characters will of course be changed like a certain character being able to have a kid but being younger than the child itself! Outfits might be changed a little depending on what Nintendo of North America thinks about bikinis and the like but I don't think so. Also pictures for dlc scenes and clips might get edited slightly. The bad language will proably be changed like it was for awakening but other than that the game shouldn't get changed to much to warrent needing to import this copy.  Should I just wait and hope for a special edition in NA?  Honestly, I love this series and couldn't wait to play it so I had no regrets importing this copy. I also collect Fire Emblem Cipher cards and love a good artbook so I got this edition before it quickly soldout. I don't doubt the US getting a special edition with all three copies of the game though and would be shocked if we didn't get this edition minus the trading cards since I don't believe those will come out here...but I hope I'm wrong!  Edit 1/22/16- The special edition was released west, but it has become very hard to obtain. The cipher cards are not included since the TCG didn't make it. A 3ds pouch and artbook are included as well as the 3 copies being on a single cartridge. We have yet to see the artbook, but I'm sure it's the same images with English text since the size/cover look the same. I've also finished the 3rd path some time ago and it is indeed as long as the other two versions!   Pros and Cons:  Pros +Each game offers a huge amount of gameplay (each just as much as Awakening) +The different versions offer enough different content to justify the purchase +New classes are very interesting (especially the Hoshido side) +Phoenix mode will help newcomers to theseries adjust +Artbook is hardcover and the artwork is beautiful just like the Cipher cards included +All three games on one cartridge  Cons -Have to download the Invisible Kingdom -My Castle is hard to understand if you don't read Japanese -Hit rates on this game seem unbalanced	2015-08-27

It is a must play for anyone who wants an adrenaline fueled action third-person shooter, with a tight cover system, amazing & powerful weapons, killer AI and the beginnings of one of the most epic stories in video game history. Missing this game for any reason would be a mistake, especially giving the added value of not one, not two, not three, but all FOUR Gears games which will be made available from Xbox 360 by backwards compatibility AND the beta to the highly anticipated latest entry in the series, Gear of War 4.	2015-08-27

The game so far seems to reward you for being good and nice. It's really addictive and fun. I can play it for hours and not notice that maybe four or five hours went by.

Well acted, great motion capture and face/body models and extremely polished AAA graphics. Also, does not suffer from darkness, unlike most games similar to Until Dawn, the vey dark scenes(which is almost the entire game) things are actually quite visible when they are supposed to be. No muddy quality or ghosting due to poor post processing and lack of lighting.<br />The acting is top notch and almost all the actors are either well-known or recognizable. It mashes all the great things from some stellar games into one. The Great modeling of faces and motion capture (do you can clearly tell who the actor is and even if you don't know their name it's oh hey that's the chick from... And that's the guy who's in all that other $@&t) pf L.A. noire, not to mention the gameplay and &#34;choose you own adventure&#34; results of heavy rain 3.0 on roids and Beyond:Two Souls 2.5 on aderall. Voice acting is top tier as well.<br />What isn't outright scary and &#34;OMFG moment of shocked and aweness&#34; is just super creepy. Reminiscent of deadly premonition in parts, with a less twin peaks vibe than DP( but definitely a modern homage to classic Lynchian works especially the Frost and Lynch TP) in its own right. Just much darker and gore ridden. It's more like twin peaks, was in the pitch dark, reading an H.P. Lovecraft collection re written by Stephen King and Joe Hill whilst on a father and son fishing trip on ketamine in Alaska during dark days, watching Saw in the background while playing all the quantic dreams and telltale games rolled into a single hybrid.<br /><br />All this praise and I will say, that like almost everything, it's not perfect. Because of the gameplay design, and the scope of the ever changing action and reactions and the cost your decisions do have, I've noticed some inconsistencies (especially when doubling back and replaying certain instances over and making different choices). But it's not sloppy or overalls distracting. The immersion is rarely ever lifted. Even during the (SPOILERZ) analysis scenes were the fourth wall is clearly broken , but in very interesting and creative ways. The pacing is almost always fluid, it's just there's certain parts where your on a frantic fast paced chase or flee, and all of a sudden you get full control of your character again and while the music is straight outta a car chase from a horror movie, and your hearts still pounding from what just happened, what's in the middle of happening, and what's gonna happen, and you are literally slowly walking or walking at a brisk pace to save someone or yourself until the next cattle shoot interactive cutscene/button mashing timing sequence begins again. It's rare, but pacing flaws like this do exist but they are short enough to forgive as your right back into the action or on to the next story.<br /><br />Also it's extremely hard to manipulate the system to get the results you want. For a number of reasons. Those who play will get the sense that when answering certain questions might be good,bad or a trick, I can tell you from replaying that it's never what you think. If you think it's a trick, it's not. If you think it isn't a trick, it kinda is. If you think your being given questions solely for the purpose that those people will die depending on your answers, it's not that simple at all. The system is much more complex then it lets you believe and the recycled scenes for multiple choices is almost non-existent.<br /><br />This game is a rare Gem, as it not only lives up to the hype, it far exceeds it. And while it is a bit on the short side (8-10!hours depending on your play style and choices) there's a ridiculous amount of replayability.<br />  I will say this, after the first few minutes the next half hour or soay seem forced, just go with it as it's not only worth but makes sense later on as it sets up tons of things and is more interactive and consequncial than it lets on to be, as most things in the game are. 9.7/10	2015-08-27

SSD would probably be amazing in this.	I was excited to get this installed since it would replace my 2TB external drive I had just sitting on top of my Xbox One. I had planned to take apart the external 2TB drive and use the hard drive inside to put into this enclosure. What I did not know was that my WD My Passport  had a proprietary usb adapter built onto the hard drive controller so there was no sata controller board. Fortunately I had an extra hard drive from my laptop which is a WD black slim 1TB SSHD. This hard drive has been working great compared to the external I was using. When I had games installed to the external they would lag hard which I had blamed the hard drive speed for since when the games were installed to the internal drive they would not lag as much. The enclosure was a little difficult to attach to the side of the console but once I figured out how the clips work it was not that bad. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is the button on the side that is supposed to press the sync button on the console does not work at all.	2015-08-27

I don't regard products like this as games. Games are fun. As I see it, this is a torture device posing as a game. I would have enjoyed it if there had been an optional difficulty level tailored to my admittedly average reflexes, but I'm not interested in spending hundreds of hours becoming more and more frustrated when what I need from a game is enjoyment. It's a bad game that only caters to folks who spend way too much time honing their reflexes to almost superhuman levels. I have a life - I don't have time for this nonsense.<br /><br />Sorry, fans, but I'm just tired of developers ignoring folks like me when it comes to top tier titles. I want to play too, but apparently Bandai isn't interested in opening up their game to a wider audience by including options for those of us who aren't interested in (and just don't have time for) a challenge of this magnitude. After all, it's not as if the elite gamers would be forced to play the game on easy difficulty - they could still go for their challenge all they want.<br /><br />The challenge and the sense of achievement that some say this game gives are just not worth the aggravation for me: it's just a game and beating it is not that important. I have better things to do with my time.	2015-08-27

Overall: This case does a great job of protecting the Wii U Gamepad and since it is clear, it has a great aesthetic appeal and all of the buttons and ports are accessible.<br />________________________________________<br />Pros:<br />• Open ports- Even with this gamepad cover on, all of the buttons and ports are easily accessible except the sync button, however, that shouldn’t be an issue because your gamepad should already be synced to the Wii U. Even the charging port is open and can be charged with the regular gamepad charged cable even with the case on. I think what people meant when they said that they can’t charge it is that you can’t charge it with one of those charging stands where you have to put the gamepad on it. I don’t have a charging stand so I couldn’t test it. Even the battery can be removed with the case on because there is an open flap in the back.<br />• Aesthetic appeal- the clear case really makes the gamepad still have its aesthetic appeal.<br />• Open circle for the buttons- I wanted to point this out specifically because it has a big open circle for the four main buttons which makes the gamepad still comfortable while playing.<br />• Easy to open and close clasps on the case.<br />________________________________________<br />Cons:<br />• Couldn’t really think of any for me. The only things worth mentioning is the sync button being covered and that it might not work on your charging pad, however, it is still chargeable with the regular charging cable.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review	2015-08-27

It was not abused, dropped or hung by the charging port. It has only ever been charged while sitting next to my PS4 on my entertainment center.<br /><br />The functionality of the keyboard itself also leaves something to be desired. It is certainly more effective than using the joysticks and typing everything out,  but it does not let you hold down Shift to capitalize, instead it toggles capslock. However through symbols key does not toggle, and works only by holding it down--like a Shift key should.<br /><br />It also does not hold a charge for much time, and is easily left on and drains quickly when not being used.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is the cheap charging station that broke the third time I charged it, though.  I will not be buying another one of these products, and I would not recommend this product to a friend. Spend a little more and get something that won't break in less than a month.	2015-08-27

It may not have the graphics or enormous music selection of the Wii U, but it definitely stands out as one of the best Smash Bros. games. The highlight for me was Smash Run, which kept me entertained for several months. However, Smash 3DS does suffer from the lack of several crucial single-player game modes, such as adventure mode, event match, and story mode. In the end this problem is balanced out by the phenomenal core gameplay in regular Smash mode, as well as the plethora of stages and DLC content.	2015-08-27

I looked into it and apparently the headset couldn't get enough power from the usb despite a brand new computer with a solid motherboard.

I admit, I didn't buy this at Amazon....I needed it right away and didn't want the usually excellent two or so day wait I get through Amazon Prime. My wife is Brazilian and we are going for 16 days in two months. I barely the Spanish I learned in high school 20 years ago (Portuguese being similar). So, I am trying to use a language learning program and it needs for me to be able to speak into a mic.<br /><br />Also, I love to game. I admit it. I am a gaming addict and proud. I use this for my home theatre PC, so I feel bad for the Xbox people who have to plug from the headphone to the xbox controller so that chat works (another reason why PC is far far superior to console gaming). I have a nice home theatre system and live pretty far from neighbours, so I can play a game or movie at proper cinema volumes without bothering anyone...except my wife when she is trying to sleep.<br /><br />So, I had to get a mic/headphone combo, and since I like gaming, I went for something of quality (I always find that it is best to get something maybe a bit more expensive, but built with good components as they will take more of a beating and last longer). Anyway, this purchase solved two of issues....being able to badly mouth Portuguese into a microphone, and being able to play games or watch a film while my wife sleeps (I am a night owl, blame it on genetic my circadian rhythm).<br /><br />How does it sound and feel?<br /><br />The headphones are built very nice and comfortably. I have big curly hair and relatively large ears as things go, and I was able to find a perfect fit over my ears and it was comfortable on my head. The felt like cloth is easy on the ears and head. The balance with the battery on the right and the mic on the left works and one notices little weight differential when on the head. The mic seems to work great. I skyped someone and they said it sounded of good quality, it works fine with the language program....now I just have to use it for teaming up in a FPS tosee how that goes. It gives a little bit of your own voice into the headphones, I guess so you know it is working and you don't scream, but don't be tricked by how loud it sounds in your ear and how it sounds for others: the sound of your voice in the headphones is subtle, but you are loud to others....if you try to make it loud in the headphones by putting it right next to your mouth, it will almost invariably cause distortion. Just put it where you can hear it a little and know that it fine.<br /><br />The sound it quite good out of the box (you really can only use a volume control and a voice to game balance (which takes some getting used to pushing on your right earpiece).<br /><br />It has quite a balance towards base even in the neutral position, so, the media setting is overload...<br /><br />But the sounds are quite lush, with a nice midrange, lush fullness (spatiality), bass is strong and highs aren't screechy.<br /><br />As to the &#34;surround&#34; and why I give it four stars (perhaps unfairly). It will never be able to compete with true 7.2 I have when using my speakers. You do get some subtle front and back cues, but it is very hard to discern if a noise is behind me or in front of me. I never have that issue with the speaker set-up. (maybe there are settings I can play with that can fix this issue, but I can't find them).<br /><br />My other beef, is that there is no PC app for the headset to tweak things. I would be happy with a eq that would allow me to set the balance I like instead of just the right headphone cushion as a eq. I would something that could I could tweak the surround to get the sound that works best for me.<br /><br />Right now, they are just drivers and you just gauge they work or not by ear, and have little discretion to adjust.<br /><br />People complain about the plastic stand for it for the money, and maybe they have a point, but it does the job and looks decent from afar.<br /><br />Great build quality, good headphone simulated surround, ease of use, just needs more tweak-ability.	2015-08-27

I decided to splurge on a nice pair of headphones, and these are rad.  They're SUPER comfortable.

I tested the game before sending it, so I'll quickly describe the differences between this and the Advance editions, because I played the advance versions before these versions.<br />I think the main difference is that FFV plays a little slower than its advance counterpart.  I find that there is a delay with a lot of battle animations, and I found that distracting.  The battle system is still intact and it's still a fun game despite the jitteriness.  The translation needs a bit of imagination to get past, but otherwise it's clear what's going on despite.<br />FFVI suffers from load times, but the translation seems to be the same as the original SNES version for the most part.  Once again, it might be worth picking up if you want to play this game for cheap and happen to own a PS3 or lower.  Both games run the same on my PS1, PS2, and PS3 with the smoothing turned off, so at the very least you can play them.<br />I think that if you just want to play these games, you'll enjoy them.  They're the weakest versions of the games, but they work and they're still as fun to play now as they would have been then.	2015-08-27

The single player of Toy Soldiers campaign is a lot of fun.  However, I primarily bought this game for  the multiplayer mode.  The multiplayer mode is poor, but can be fixed with patches.  To start, there never seems to be enough players online to hold a 2 vs 2 game.  A 2 vs 1 game always leads to a slaughter of the single player.  When I am able to enter into a 2 vs 2 game, it always leads to either me or one of the other players being disconnected within two rounds.<br /><br />One of the other issues I have with the multiplayer mode is that the heroes are way too overpowered.  The game is basically a rush for the hero to destroy the other player's towers as fast as they are able to build them.  This makes the game very frustrating and takes away the fun and strategy of tower building that you experience during the first person campaign.  I would be happy if they made it so that the hero is unable to destroy towers, but allows the hero to destroy the attacking army and hero.<br /><br />As I said, the first person campaign is a lot of fun while the multiplayer has the potential to be just as fun or more fun with the proper patches and fixes.	2015-08-27

I was thinking game of the year contender.<br /><br />The combat felt responsive and visceral, as did the stealth kills, as did harvesting herbs with my knife, shooting orcs in the head with my magic arrows, and generally just running around felt right.<br /><br />But everything this game does, (including the graphics and the scenery) ceases to be fun after a few hours.<br /><br />It's all very arcadey, even the difficulty. It's like the game wants you to cough up quarters every time you die. More flexibility in the quest system would have made the game more dynamic, more fun.<br /><br />Enemies can't see you until you're very close, a design choice that makes stealth kills from behind quickly feel cheap and too easy to obtain, and the longer you play, the less fun they are, and imo, stealth kills are the best part of the game.<br /><br />I also died many times because I suck / did not complete the game in the right order.<br /><br />I went off on my own, trying to take down orcs in the order I chose, and rage quit after dying 20 times in a row.<br /><br />I also did not like having to collect magic arrows for my bow. If they're magic arrows, why are they littered all over mordor for you to find? Orcs can't use 'em, orcs can't see 'em. Would have made more sense to put them on a cooldown, give you arrows for free as time passes.<br /><br />The game is, essentially, one man against all the forces of Mordor. And that wouldn't be fun, and it's not.<br /><br />The game doesn't do very many things, and what it does do isn't very good, and you're forced to repeat them over and over and over again.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this game, is that everything you'd want to do in a lord of the rings game, like visit the snowy mountains of cahardras, the dark mines of moria, ride horses across the plains of rohan, see edoras, rivendell, osgiliath, ithilien, fangorn, minas tirith, the forbidden pool, the winding stair, shelob's lair, orthanc, etc etc, you cannot do. it's just a boring endless combat game in a bland, ugly environment that you quickly become bored of being chained to.<br /><br />It squanders the rich lore of middle earth, the hobbit, and lord of the rings.<br /><br />Remember the films? the beautiful colours and the wide variety of environments?<br /><br />The unforgettable characters and villains?<br /><br />Gollum makes a pointless appearance so the ranger can choke him, because every ranger chokes gollum.<br /><br />There's this attempt to rebrand rangers as these uncaring and inhuman people.  None of that s*** is actually in the books.  But yet again, this game reinforces that bulls*** stereotype.<br /><br />None of that is here. why should anyone give a crap about this game? it's not worthy of the middle earth license.<br /><br />It's also got the bioshock vita chamber never really die thing going, which makes no sense for the middle earth universe. I quickly came to hate it, dying over and over with no point but to die again.  It's not a good sign that this is the most interesting part of the game.<br /><br />The ending is anti climactic and feels almost pointless<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />\\\"You really want to quit?

US	34213674	R1LUVUI357ROLF	B00MV7KVP4	92208606	Until Dawn  - PlayStation 4 [Digital Code]	Video Games	4	2	2	N	N	Choices...choices...choices...	I was 100% psyched to get this. I did not have a PS3 (had a 360) so missed out on Heavy Rain. Then when I heard they were making a game with the same formula but with a horror twist. I knew I had to get the game. After playing it through the first time. I had good intuition. I was hooked in the moment I started playing. Now the game is short. Ive heard of people beating it in one day. Which was expected considering how when a character dies they stay dead until you restart the game from scratch.<br /><br />Every choice matters no matter how small. Something trivial early in the game can determine someone's fate. Heck sometimes doing the right thing can end in a death even if you did it to possibly save one. Twice I made a choice that anyone of us would make whether make sure someone is being protected or helping someone calling for help. But it caused a person's death.<br /><br />A nice feature is in the menu is when you make a choice that leads to a butterfly affect you can view it and when something happens later in game you can see what choice led to that moment. One problem I had with the game is people compared it to a interactive movie but to me it was either a short season of a tv show or a mini series. Not because the game is divided into chapters (10 in all) but there wasn't really a central story. It jumps to a whole another story eventually and the game didn't need to have one and the other. A full game with one of the stories would have been great.<br /><br />Despite the faults after the credits rolled with the survivors reeling in (3 of the 8 survived) I was wanting more. I will of course play it again and try to have more...or dare I say...less survivors. Not that many games can say people want to play more long after the game ends. With the game being advertised as having hundreds of endings, many scenarios based on choices. The replay value is high.<br /><br />If you want a great scary game, with a good cast. Get this...but as some reviews show. Itsnot for everyone. But if you liked Telltale's walking dead, wolf among us, etc where choices matter get this. This is an amped version of them. As you can die and then start the level again in those. Like in real life death is final...or until you start from scratch. If you don't want this now, get it for Halloween.<br /><br />and remember. Anyone can live, anyone can die, everyone can live...and everyone can die<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Almost every choice matters<br />-High replay value<br />-Good actors<br />-good scares<br />-a lot of twists and turns<br />-reviewing past butterfly affects and what they caused<br /><br />Cons:<br />-short game<br />-game never really has a center plot<br />-not for everyone	2015-08-27

If you're viewing this item now, I'm sure it's because you've heard all of the hype about this game, and those who talk about it don't lie. It is such a creative and addicting game with so many options for playability. It's a blast to play with your friends, and even just by yourself. It has pretty much all of the features that it has on the computer, minus the mods of course. Microsoft constantly releases new add ons and updates though so there's always more to do.

Great for last-gen owners of the game who miss the game or have never played the DLC before. Worst for people who have played the PC version or have owned all the DLC on last gen systems.<br /><br />Dishonored is worth your every penny... if you had bought it years ago 2012. It was a fantastic game at the time, and even now, it still is. However, for a game that came out 2012, it runs on the Xbox One of 2015 (I have no experience with the PS4 version, though I suspect it runs identically) as if it were still on the Xbox 360. Long load times, 30 FPS or less, and only *slightly* crisper graphics. This is clearly no Remastered edition. Closer to a well-done port. The Definitive edition is a sort of balance between the X360 release and the much superior PC version. Simply put, the Definitive edition is a bit of a technical disappointment.<br /><br />Okay, so I've made the game sound terrible to some people. It isn't. Dishonored itself was wonderfully polished, fun, and filled with lots of political intrigue. It would take a while to sum up all the good points of the game and bundled DLC. And believe me, the positives DEFINITELY outweigh the negatives. Newcomers will NOT be disappointed. Returning players will be pleasantly replaying a great game. But veterans will be playing pretty much the same game they've already played.	2015-08-27

I don't play many PS4 games but I felt I needed some additional cushion and surface area.<br /><br />Let me first note that I didn't realize how aggressive I am with my controller, so this review may be slightly biased.<br />For starters, they will easily pop out if I'm pushing to hard at the edge, especially when playing with racing games. They got a lot of abuse during Rocket League. The more they popped out, the looser they got to the point I just stopped using them. This was very frustrating for them to pop out during an intense gaming session/scene/etc.<br /><br />The absolute worst part is that the little tabs that hold them, would catch on the DS4's own rubber pads. These things actually ruined my left stick's rubber padding. It created a gash and it just got worse every time it popped out. Unfortunately for me, I noticed too late. It's one thing not using something that cost me $13, but another thing ruining and having to buy a new controller that will cost over $50.<br /><br />I definitely like that it has a big and wide soft grip, but I wish it had a better way of locking them in.	2015-08-27

US	17058574	R21ZU2VIPZFZF6	B011T2FO8A	149095953	Xbox One 1TB Console - Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle with 3 Month Xbox Live Gold Card	Video Games	4	17	17	N	N	Buying guide for Xbox One bundles	I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are 8 at the time of writing. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (fall 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here - http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility  It will stream content to Windows devices.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into2 different groups based on onboard storage (500GB and 1TB). The 1TB bundles also include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in. There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, headset (with at least one exception), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  1TB bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money)-  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Amazon Entertainment MCC 1TB bundle. $399.  Includes everything from the previous plus $10 gift cards for Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Digital Music, and Comixology, and a 3-month Xbox Live Gold card. You may not use all of the additional stuff, but it's still a better value than the previous bundle. B+ rating.  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content. As Forza 6 is a newer game than MCC (and thus more costly) I'm according this bundle a higher A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. EXCEPT - It looks like the FIFA bundle won't include a headset. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 12 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- rating for Madden. B+ for FIFA.  Amazon Entertainment Madden bundle. $399. Includes everything from the previous Madden plus $10 gift cards for Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Digital Music, and Comixology, and a 3-month Xbox Live Gold card. You may not use all of the additional stuff, but it's still a better value than the previous bundle. A rating.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). C rating.  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B- rating.  500GB bundles-  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. Looks like this being phased out. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Addition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. There are frequently other, short-term bundles that include an extra, game, controller, or Live for the same cost. A- rating.  Hope you found this comparison useful.	2015-08-27
