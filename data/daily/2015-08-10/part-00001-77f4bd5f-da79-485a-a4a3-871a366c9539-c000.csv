The most recent pair had problems from day 1 - the hooks at the top swivel around, so the shoes come untied. I ended up needing to re-tie them repeatedly during the day. Perhaps due to this, after a few months the lace sleeve (the 3rd row from the top) popped out of the leather on one of the shoes. The right shoe also becomes very uncomfortable after a few hours and starts digging into my heel enough to cause blisters. None of this used to be a problem with this style.<br /><br />Perhaps this is another example of &#34;quality fade&#34; and Timberland simply doesn't care (they certainly didn't seem to be motivated to do anything about the pair where the soles fell off when I called them). Maybe they're intentionally cutting corners. Regardless, this is the last Timberland product I will purchase.	2015-08-10

Stylish and comfortable flat sandals that can be dressed up or down. I plan to buy the other color!<br />Pros: Stylish, cover more toe area than most (about half of my third toe is covered which I like), they are true to size (I wear and bought an 8), Color matched description (I got the tan)<br />Cons: Although they fit me perfectly the ankle strap is shorter than most and may not fit all ankles. I think I have normal ankles but in most shoes I have to pull to the tightest hole. With these I can only buckle at the second hole. Also there is no cushion or arch support but I have walked around for hours shopping in these and had no problems. If you have narrow feet these are not for you because they are not a snug fit whatsoever on my normal width feet.	2015-08-10

It's almost like not wearing shoes at all. The downside of the &#34;Goga mat&#34; insole is that if you're wearing socks, the rubber is so grippy that I had a really hard time getting my feet into the shoes. I sprinkled some powder in there and it helped. Over time, the Goga mat developed another annoying issue. It continually pulls my socks down inside the shoe until they're wadded up under the arch of my foot. It drives me bonkers. If they would make that insole less grippy, this would eliminate the sock issues. I know they're marketed for people who don't want to wear socks, but honestly, who exercises with no socks in a shoe that's not washable? That would equal very smelly shoe in a very short time.	2015-08-10

They are very nice looking shoes but the right corner rubs against two of my toes.  They're not that comfortable.  I had a size larger and they were too big and loose.

I picked these up at the local sketchers outlet after trying out the non-laced version ( Skechers Men's Go Walk 3 Unwind ) at my local Kohls.After being told by my fiance that they looked like prison slippers, I knew I had to search out a laced version.<br /><br />I have only had these a few days, but already, I'm finding them to be the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned. In the past, I have bought a few of the sketcher hiking/trail shoes, and loved them, but man, for walking long distances or as a &#34;daily driver&#34;, you can't beat these. The one thing that I don't like is how they dont feel quite as stable as a hiking shoe when running. They could also be cheaper, but I got them as a buy one, get one 1/2 off deal, so its not too terrible. I hope this helps anyone reading this.	2015-08-10

I purchased this boot after a long search, for my son who had foot surgery.  His doctor required him to wear<br />something with good foot and ankle support.  Normal basketball shoes don't work, as they lack arch support and<br />are notoriously shallow through the toe box, and narrow across the forefoot.<br /> Merrell has been a long standing favorite with our family.<br />I was immediately relieved to see that this boot came in an &#34;E Width&#34;  VERY HARD TO FIND!!!!!<br />It fits like a favorite slipper , with plenty of room for orthotics.  Fit is true, maybe a teensy wide, but that is exactly<br />why we ordered the wide width.<br />  It is a good looking boot, and doesn't look &#34;clunky&#34;  .  It is also subtle enough for schools with strict dress codes.<br />Hopefully one day Merrell will make an all black version of this.<br />  My only issue with this GREAT boot, are the laces.  Terrible.  They are slippery, and untie themselves easily , even<br />when double-knotted.  They are difficult to tie and keep tight.  Merrell had a great boot, that won't stay tied..problem.<br />I don't know if &#34;Lock Laces&#34; will fit this boot and hold tightly enough or not, but my next &#34;Amazon Search&#34; will be<br />for laces that aren't such a pain the the neck.<br />Overall however, I would say this boot is a &#34;thumbs up&#34;.	2015-08-10

They are so stylish, cute, & comfortable. I thought I had read a review that said they ran small, so I ordered an 8 & 1/2 instead of an 8 & they are very &#34;roomy&#34;. So, I don't think I agree with the review that said they run small. If anything, I think they are true to size or a bit on the larger side. But that's not a bad thing, because it allows room for a heavier sock in the winter and/or an insole, which is what I'm using. Also, you can lace them up as tight you want, so I think the size on these is actually perfect.  I also don't agree with the review that said these boots are flimsy. They are not hard & heavy, but I think they are very sturdy & substantial--pleasantly more than I was expecting. I, too, was imagining that these boots might be rather cheaply made since they were only listed @ $17.99 when I first added them to my wish list. And I was dismayed when I saw the price had jumped up to $31.99 by the time I was ready to order. I thought I would have to be a fool to pay &31.99 for a $17.99 boot, but I really wanted the white ones & couldn't find anything else like them. So, I took a chance but wasn't honestly expecting much. So wrong! These boots are incredible & absolutely worth the &31.99! Also, they were delivered very quickly, so I am delighted with the seller as well as the product & am definitely planning on ordering another pair/color! Great purchase! Very happy!	2015-08-10

[[VIDEOID:432d1460aed4c82947c27aa5b2bffded]] I was happy to receive them i really needed them (summer time) .. i had ordered the brown one. The sunglasses are pictured exactly as they look in person. The glasses themselves are brown in color with a brownish type lens.They offer moderate sun protection and are easy to see through and they do darken the view a fair bit. Hence These glasses themselves are more of a fashion accessory than to get protection from sun.I love having a lot of them to match my outfits:) These  glasses are quite narrow so fits me well as i have a narrow forehead.They have plastic tortoiseshell rims and arms, and gold colored rims and details. The nosepieces have some silicone pads for comfort and to keep them from sliding down. It may be uncomfortable for a person with a  big round head . Its well priced and look very fashionable.<br /><br />Product received for testing and review purposes.	2015-08-10

They're worth every penny and has given my life back and possibly extend the years I can be mobile.	2015-08-10

This is a very cute flip flop; however, runs very small. I have been a size 6 for 30 years, order shoes online all the time and have never had to return a size 6. After contacting the seller, found out I must pay for return (yes I should have noticed this to begin with but again, I have never had a problem with a size 6). The cost to ship it back to China isnt worth the amount I would get back. I sucked it up and wore them to the wedding I ordered them for and they did ok. Could t wear them an extended length of time though. My heel slightly hangs off the back. Oh, and I did not get them on time when I PAID to receive them in 2 days...it took them 4!!! Will definitely never order from this seller again. Buyer beware!	2015-08-10

These sandals have held up well even to the boat launch (which destroyed a few of my husband's other sandals, when you're standing in shallow water, your sandal gets stuck in the muck, and the thong pulls out).  We're very happy with them.  I typically watch for the $12 specials, because sandals don't last forever, but these sandals were definitely worth the $42 investment.  They seem like they'll last a long time.  Also, my husband is a size 12.5 U.S. in athletic shoes but the Reef size 12.0 fits him well for these sandals.	2015-08-10

I wear them all the time now and need to buy another pair because I think I've stretched out the band from over use.<br /><br />I have high arches so I don't really need arch support, but if someone does these may bother you. I also have wide feet and mine fit PERFECT in both size and width. I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!	2015-08-10

The shoes are also a bit on the wide side, but he also has long skinny feet, so maybe its just his experience. The look is exactly what I was hoping for and he says they are super comfortable. He did add some arch inserts but I think it was more b/c he had them sitting around, not b/c the shoes were uncomfortable. Overall I would absolutely recommend these. Perfect summer shoes!I also love the pattern on the inside of the shoe, I know no one can see that, but it does add a fun flair.	2015-08-10

Other than that they are quite comfortable and I actually was able to wear them for work for 5 hours and only had to take them off because they were causing hot spots on the tops of my toes due to the narrow width.  I have ordered a different color in an 8.5 B instead of an 8 C/D, so we will see how that works...hopefully it will work well.	2015-08-10

I really like the look of this show, but it is not the best fit for me. I ordered an 11 m,  but I wear 10E to 10.5M in most dress shoes. Even though this is an 11M, it seems a little small in the toe area. Not because it is too narrow, the top is too low. And there is also a slight curve that combines with not having enough height that presses down on the top of my foot.	2015-08-10

I ordered this brand a year ago in a women's size 11. I work 8 hours on my feet. The shoe was excellent. Then I ordered this style shoe in the same size. Same brand as the last pair because they were so comfortable. I put the new pair on and went to work and my feet were killing me. I thought maybe I just had to break them in. So I wore them the next night and the same thing. Real tight and crunching my toes. When I got home I got the first pair out and put the shoes against each other sole to sole. This pair was almost an inch shorter. The size read 11 but it wasn't. Very disappointed with this transaction.

See those belt looking things on either side of the bottom pocket? Well the clasp of the belt is held onto the bag by of all things a magnetic clasp fixed to the bag itself. I was bemused, but not upset when I realized this because who cares how its held on, even if there's no need to ever take this belt clasp off the purse. Then I used this bag while I was walking my dog, and when my arm brushed the bag a bit roughly, the magnetic clasp came off the bag, undid itself from the belt, and fell on the sidewalk. I'm really glad I heard it clink to the ground so I could pick it up, but now I'm worried that I'll lose these pieces when I wear the bag, so I haven't ended up using it until I can find some superglue.  Overall a great purse at a great price (as long as you're not paying the $99 original price), just with some questionable design &#34;features&#34;.	2015-08-10

However after a few hours of wearing them I wish I had sent them back. There's something about their build that causes pain on my outer ankle bones. I've tried tying them different but it's still there. Unfortunately most socks cushion the bottom, not up the leg so I don't really get much protection from my socks and it's too hot in the south for wool ones in summer.<br />Otherwise I like the way they look and seem to have a sturdy build.	2015-08-10

They do run overall a bit small, so if you are a half size or wide foot, I would size up. Even though the shoe is narrow there still seems to be enough room in the shoe for an insert if you want some actual cushioning, as this shoe doesn't provide any support.  If you have fat calves like mine these boots are wonderful, you can unlace the seam in the back to adjust to your size.	2015-08-10

I wish I had these in Iraq, my feet wouldn't not have been in pain or swollen from all the guard shifts for hours at time on my feet.  Currently working at a hospital, I'm on my feet most of the time during an 8 hour shift and since I've been wearing these for a month my feet are not swollen and in pain.

I absolutely love this style of Havaianas.  Like most people, I've owned several pairs of Havaianas over many years, but I'd never ventured outside of their flip flop styles until recently.  Traditional flip flops are great and all, but the back strap makes these so much easier to walk in, especially for long(er) walks on the beach or doing anything even remotely active, like carrying luggage or throwing a frisbee.<br /><br />These sandals were SO comfortable from the moment I put them on.  These have never given me any blisters or areas of irritation on my feet, which I can't say of probably 95% of the other sandals I've worn.  Some of my friends have made fun of me, saying that they look like little kids' sandals, but I know they'll come around eventually. :)<br /><br />This is my second pair in this style, and I plan to buy more!	2015-08-10

They did slip on my heels, but aren't too wide anywhere else even though my feet are on the narrow side. A smaller size would have been too short and cramped my toes so I'm glad I went with my regular size. I bought some stick on pads for the heels and now they fit perfect. No more slipping.  They are comfortable enough to wear to work, but I do have a desk job.  Not sure they would be comfortable standing all day, but what heels are?  These are a great height, tall enough to be stylish, but not so high that they are difficult to walk in.	2015-08-10

So I exchanged for a size up, and they were still super tight, but I figured I didn't dare go any larger due to length. After wearing them for a month, I now I know I should have kept the first pair, in my usual size. As they wear in, they get much, much looser. They still work totally fine and I wear them daily for walking, but I wish I had the smaller size since that's really a better fit for me.	2015-08-10

They are comfortable, warm, and soft, and with the rubber sole and moccasin look, they're perfectly fine to wear outside on your way to grab the morning paper. The shearling does tend to wear out (and tear out) over time, and if you have warm feet, they'll graduate to very warm feet within an hour of wearing these slippers (unless your house is properly chilly), but I am delighted to own a pair and am looking forward to that first cold autumn night when I can wear them again.	2015-08-10

Won't always feel like my phone is falling out.  I'm just so happy with this bag.  Is it some crazy print?  No, but you know what?  I'm kinda over the whole flowery print thing anyway.

I normally wear 10 1/2 and end up getting 11s. Fits just fine. I'd spray a fabric protect any before wearing because it's suede (good habit for all shoes though). Insoles are a little flat and the tongue is a little thin. Other than that, great shoes.	2015-08-10

The piece between my toes didn't really bother me, but the bone just underneath my big toe was killing me.

I've run in Sauconys' before and I love their powergrid EVA. The design behind this shoe was amazing and the tread seemed to provide good traction on almost all surfaces as long as they weren't sliding underfoot(the lugs are not deep at all). The ride of the shoes was nice and provided a good combination of cushion and responsiveness. The problem with this shoe is how sloppy the fit is. I normally wear a size 9 shoe and I have a somewhat wide foot, though I comfortably run in normal width shoes. When I first put on the shoes, my toes were comfortable and everything was fitting nicely aside from the heel which is the only reason that I dislike this shoe, but it's a huge deal for me. The heel doesn't hold your foot in at all and it has too much space so yur foot can move around in it pretty easily. While running around, I never felt like I could tackle any technical because of how sloppy the heel was. If they could fix this shoe by making the heel a bit more rigid and making it more narrow, it would be an amazing shoe for trail runs of any distance.	2015-08-10

I have low arches and when I put these shoes on, what a relief! Many people were writing in about the size, but I chose 1 size up to alleviate the width and the compression. If you feel like these shoes are going to be too small for your feet in your regular size or if you have any foot problems, I would suggest 1 size up. The shoes stretch, but if you have bunions or pes planus (flat feet) they might be a bit snug. I bought them to wear to follow nurses around when they are doing clinicals. I must be on my feet all day. These shoes are as light as a feather and people asked me where I got them. I chose this color because the sole was lighter and it seemed to brighten up people when they saw them. The shoes have enough stretch for the swelling that feet can have at the end of the day. I am happy with this pair of shoes.	2015-08-10

I have a career where I must dress professionally but also have to walk around a lot and these are pretty comfortable for a heel. Not that I can go running in them, but they work for what I need to do in a typical work day. Most of my work shoes are Lifestride, because of the comfort factor. I'll probably get these in another color.	2015-08-10

Yes they are somewhat narrow as some other reviewers commented, I read that and I was expecting that as I have average feet I'll say.<br />This helped my feet to stay tight and reduce any movement while I play.

They are very stylish - they look exactly like rain boots from Aldo that I waited too long to buy and couldn't find any longer, and are really cute with skinny jeans. They are also super comfortable and I could walk in them for hours. There was no chance of slipping on slippery surfaces as the rubber on the sole was awesome, and they kept my feet totally dry walking through wet grass and small puddles. The only kind of odd thing about them was the width of the opening at the ankle. I don't have super skinny ankles, but I don't have cankles either - and there was at least 2-3 inches of space around my ankles. It only really sprinkled while I was in Ireland so I didn't have much of a problem with this, but I imagine that if I was in a crazy downpour my feet would get wet just from rain falling into the shoe. Another gripe I had with them was that the inside sole kept coming out every time I pulled my foot out. I guess super glue or something would make them stick down better. Also - if you are traveling with these boots, note that they are going to be very HEAVY in your suitcase. All in all, I am very glad I bought these boots simply from how cute and stylish they are for the price and they totally worked well for me during my trip.	2015-08-10

Never minded the extra weight in exchange for good support and protection. Lately, though, I've been getting into trail running, so I needed something light that could also get me through a rugged bridle trail without tearing up my feet. I first tried the Saucony Peregrine 5 but failed to find a good fit. My feet are a little wider than normal, and I found the Peregrine toe box to be too narrow. Enter Pearl Izumi. The EM N1 runs for $115, but Amazon had my size for $40 so it was a no-brainer to give them a try. They are some incredibly ugly shoes, but wow is the fit perfect for me. No heel slippage but plenty of room in the toe box for my toes to fully splay. I'd be interested to try the N2 for the extra cushioning, but I was satisfied with the support. I took them out yesterday for a 17 mile hike and had zero problems. Today my feet feel like I spent all weekend in bed. I was so impressed, I got home from my hike and immediately ordered another pair. I haven't run in them yet, but I don't foresee having any problems. If you've got a wide foot like me, do yourself a favor and try these out.	2015-08-10

The aviator’s frame is light so it does not bother your ears or nose. I bought the metallic color frame with the smoke color lenses. The polarized lenses would protect your eyes from the UVA and UVB rays. I usually use the sunglasses while I’m driving; I noticed a difference between when I don’t used or use the sunglasses. The polarized lenses eliminated most of the glare and my eyes are not feeling as tired. The polycarbonate material made then strong and shatter resistant. I feel confident that these sunglasses are protecting my eyes and improving my vision while driving on Sunny Florida.  The lens width is 58 mm, height 45 mm, bridge 21 mm and arm 137 mm. I bought this product at a discounted price, in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion after testing the product	2015-08-10

Sole fit my standard size 7 foot.  BUT I  returned them because the toe area was too wide.  My toes were sliding forward and sticking out past the sole of the shoe.

As much as I Love these sneakers, I had to give it 4 stars because of the lack of 1/2 sizes.  They are beautiful and so different.<br />I wear a 6 1/2,  but these sneakers only come in whole sizes.  I bought the 7, which I now have to watch because I can slip out of them.  Went back and bought the size 6.  Not too tight but they are not a 6 1/2.  So I now have two pairs of the same shoe different sizes.  I'm still keeping both.<br />Too beautiful to send back.  And I can still wear both sizes.  My suggestion:  If you wear a 1/2 size - think twice.	2015-08-10

As is shown in the picture, it has a matte leather finish that doesn't rub-off on clothes thankfully. I'm used to a perpendicular connection between the heel and the shank of the shoe but the angled connection doesn't look bad at all. Very comfortable. Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a business-casual type shoe in a sturdy, boot form.	2015-08-10

I wouldn't have worn them anywhere else, maybe to the market, but honestly I have tons of shoes and these were not worth keeping. I got the UGG Uptowns II off eBay for a really good price (less than these) and they are a far superior shoe in every way.	2015-08-10

Although I can completely see how the mouth at the ankle might be a bit loose for some people, I have thick ankles and calves, and wide feet, and the 6.5M fit me very comfortably! And they are so light (especially for hiking shoes) that after a few minutes I forgot I was wearing them! I also have high arches, and these shoes have excellent support, and a thick sole with great grip and water resistance. I cannot wait to get out on the trail!!

There is one thing I do not like about the handbag, but I can live with it.<br />The shoulder strap is very long, as for using the bag as a crossbody handbag. The shoulder strap has two places for adjustments. The strap could use some more holes to make the strap shorter, so you can reach into the bag while it is on your shoulder. As short as I can make the shoulder strap, I will have to take the bag off of my shoulder to look for something inside.<br /> If you look at the strap in the picture, there are two adjustment areas, (One adjustment area on the strap is partially hidden.) and they are facing the same way which makes one of the strap adjustments pointing up instead of down when the strap is on your shoulder.  The end of the strap sticks up and out.  It is a very nice bag, but Dooney & Bourke should correct this flaw.	2015-08-10

Once they were on markdown I snatched them up.  I've gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed.  The shoe itself runs on the smaller, more narrow side, which is typical for EUR shoes.  Unfortunately what those generally have in ample arch support and ventilation these lack.  The shoes are fine, with some sort of nylon or sock, but I personally found my feet growing sore and tired in them far sooner than most of my other shoes of a similar style and height.  They are quite pretty, but for the price I anticipated better craftsmanship.  Great for a few hours while all dolled up, but stow something more comfortable in your purse.	2015-08-10

My calves are enormous, 18 inches, and they fit great thanks to the lace-up part in the back.<br />Unfortunately I had to send them back. The color just doesn't match the rest of my cosplay for comic con. My other reason for returning is that while these boots are super sexy, I decided I would regret being on my feet all day for comic con if I wore these.<br />If you're going to wear them to parties or around the office, I'm sure you'll love them.<br />Also, other reviewers complained about this infamous &#34;gas smell&#34;. As far as the pair I received, NO SMELL at all. It does seem like the company has been listening to the complaints though. On 2 sides of the shoe box, there are plastic-rimmed holes, I assume for ventilation. I suppose this is to ensure that whatever smell results from production doesn't linger on to bother the customer. Hope that helps.<br />(My rating might not say &#34;amazon verified purchase&#34; because my husband ordered it on his account, but I promise I'm legit :)  )	2015-08-10

The color gold is a bit too shiny but will likely tone down, as I continue to wear them. I bought them, since I have a herniated disc/compressed nerve injury, in my lower back. While most sandals do not provide support and aggravate my injury, my vionic sandals do not. They are also fashionable looking. I am eager to give them the ultimate test, once school starts. As a teacher, I will be on my feet most of the day, up and down flights of stairs and expect they will keep my feet cool, and help keep my back and feet aligned. I am planing on purchasing a pair of the shoe booties for winter, since I know they will provide style and support. Very pleased and highly recommend - In addition, the price was considerably less than the catalog that introduced them to me. They arrived so quickly, I could not wait to try them on. They are as comfortable as my birks but much more dressy - Thanks Amazon for your great service and product choices.	2015-08-10

The two Velcro straps adjust nicely to ensure a good fit.  I purchased these shoes in teal, and the color is fantastic!  The shoes are a vibrant turquoise and add a nice pop of color to black jeans or pants!  I purchased two additional pairs of CH turquoise shoes this year (Aubrey and Alexa), and these are my favorite ones so far due to their appearance, casualness, comfort, and ease of getting on and off! They were a little longer than expected--I usually wear a size 9, and an 8.5 would have fit slightly better. When I ordered these shoes, I was not sure that I would like the decorative appliques, but they really enhance the appearance!  I plan to purchase another pair of these shoes in black very soon!  The heel is a nice height and  makes the shoe dressier than a flat sandal. These shoes can easily be worn during the summer, fall, and spring. I love these shoes!	2015-08-10

I had to return these they were too hard on my feet. I have plantar fasciitis and heel spurs so if you have regular feet they are probably ok for you. I liked the arch support but my feet tend to roll out on the ankle so the arch support has to be just right. The price was good so I was bummed to send them back.

My son says they are pretty comfortable. My only 2 complaints are for one, the yellow is really only visible on the laces.  Although the tongue is also yellow, once tied you can see it and the shoes look like they should otherwise have white laces to match. The second issue is the do not look like they will hold up long with their nearly solid mesh construction. I give these a month, tops. But you get what you pay for, right.	2015-08-10

I bought these in my actual size because of the $15 price tag and they are tight. I'm not returning them. I think the canvas and leather will stretch and loosen after a short time. If you have real wide feet these might not be the best for you.  These came with black and white laces. They are a good looking shoe. I'm not surprised that business men pick up some of these skate shoes to wear to the office. They have a classy look like patent leather shoes.  I intend to skate these once I've broken them in. They are made of both canvas and leather, but it appears that the areas that are subjected to the most abrasion are leather or rubber.  This is my 1st pair of Fallen shoes.  These shipped fast. I ordered on Friday morning and received them Monday afternoon.  I'll edit and update this review once I've broken in and skated these shoes....  Edit/update: I've got about 8 hours of skate time on these shoes and an additional 8 hours of casual wear. They're stretching out a little and I'm really enjoying these on my boards. I kind of like the snug fit for skating. I'm not one to skate with loose shoes or slip ons. As far as wear, all I have is a scuff from Ollie's. I haven't hit the toe leather yet from kickflips and I kickflip frequently.  In closing, if these aren't unbearably tight on your feet, give them some break in time. They're worth it. Also, keep in mind these are skate shoes that are purpose built. They're not ez spirits, or sketchers or new balance. They're not intended to walk the park after bingo or hustle around the office. These shoes are for thrashing the park and grinding the ledges in front of the office.	2015-08-10

I normally wear a size 8 in street shoes, but in athletic shoes I normally go up half a size for comfort.<br />What can I say. I had been hesitant to get lifting shoes for Crossfit, using slightly flatter running shoes since I have high arches that need support, but I was pleasantly surprised. Lifting in these shoes has made a difference in my lifting technique. Running short distances is ok, but I wouldn't wear these for longer runs. Besides that I love these shoes and I love the color.	2015-08-10

You have the OK to order your normal usual size.	UPDATE2 after a year of use:  I am not an intense skateboarder. I use them as loafers, and they are not the only shoes I wear. After a year, the shoes are showing some wear and tearing beside the little toe, on both shoes.  But they're still going.  The back part tore at the top when I didn't untie my laces properly to remove or put them on.  Most shoes are forgiving of this, not these.  So they are having a beginning stage of falling apart that is taking a long time, and I still like to wear them because of their light weight.  I don't want to replace them, because I'm stubborn and want to get my money's worth, determined to wear them out till they fall apart before I might buy another pair - only in leather next time.   UPDATE1:  I am reducing my rating by one star. shortly after I bought them, the loop at the back, that you grasp to help put them on, came off. Testament to fragile construction. Not happy about that.  Before buying these, I went to a local skate shop in my city to try several brands on. (The clerk at Emp!re was so lazy at first, just chatting with other staff, and then so impolite, that I have absolutely no regrets buying here instead of paying him full retail price).  What I learned, is that Vans are the narrowest, but all brands are extremely narrow and uncomfortable, and while you have to generally go a half size larger, with DC you have to go a full size larger.  To help you better chose the right size, let me give you some background on myself: I wear a size 10 on average. I do have one pair of shoes, for playing soccer, that is 9.5, so I have it snug, as no extra space in front of the toes is desirable. But generally, I buy 10.5 to get a little bit of extra width. I tried these on in the store, and 10.5 fit well, felt light, and it was like you were walking on air. Those were the ones with the large mesh upper.  The ones I ordered are a finer mesh, and are not as comfortable as the ones in the store.  My little toes stick out to the side slightly, as the shoe stretches easily to accomodate your foot's width. In retrospect, I wonder if I shouldn't have ordered a 10, instead of a 10.5, in the case of this model, but I'm thinking that maybe my little toe would be sticking out too far from the side, causing premature wear at that point.  I am generally not impressed with skate shoes. But my well-padded running shoes just don't cut it for skateboarding, and a fall wearing my five-fingers left too much of a gauge on my foot to want to go without skate shoes again.  When I was little, skate shoes, like Converse for example, sold at KMart for $5 a pair. It was what poor parents bought their kids when they couldn't afford better shoes, and us kids hated the experience.  By some stroke of marketing genius, these companies have turned the budget product into a high-priced fasion product with a cult following.  My advice is this (it's what I did), your preferred color might not the the cheapest one there, but your second or third-favorite might be a bargain.  These shoes were about 40 in the size-color combination that I settled on, which is far more reasonable than the 120 they asked in the store for this model. Some of them are under $30, close to 20... but in my size, they were just too ugly. Given they are more comfortable than all other skate shoe models, I think paying about 40 is an OK deal.  But don't go spending 120 on these just because your kid asks for it - none of these skate shoe models are worth that. These are $20 shoes that you accept to pay a little bit extra for on account that they are more comfortable.	2015-08-10

I have never been a &#34;flip-flop person.&#34; The &#34;plastic&#34; ones cut up my feet and slip and slide. The leather or vinyl ones make my feet blister. The J2 Stars, on the other hand, fit perfectly. I couldn't be more pleased. The material straps don't cut up my tender feet and they are quite comfortable. Hubby accidentally stepped on the back of the shoe on my right foot and the strap came out of the slot but I was able to put it back in with a key and a penny to hold it down for the rest of the afternoon until I could use something more binding. Big win. Glad I bought a dozen of them. If your feet are a standard medium width and your feet don't tend to swell much or be &#34;thick,&#34; you should enjoy them as much as I do.	2015-08-10

All the stars in the world for these shoes! I work full time on concrete floors with chronic knee injuries, and was having some serious pain in my muscles and joints until I bought these. These shoes are definitely not your everyday cute, trendy tennies, but they are comfortable, durable, and offer serious support if you're on your feet all day. The print makes them more interesting than your average work shoe. They also help reduce fatigue! My only complaint is that they are clunky, heavy, and HOT if you're used to wearing lightweight shoes outside of work. The wide, angled toe box took some getting used to, and I still catch my toes on stuff all the time.<br /><br />I'll confirm that these are easily scuffed and the color does come off if rubbed the wrong way. I don't particularly mind because the print is so varied and spotted to begin with, but if having marks and scrapes on shoes will bother you, it will be better to seek a pair without graphics printed on.	2015-08-10

Second it had a very strange odor.  The minute it took it out of the box I could smell it. I took all the paper and plastic out of it and on it. That did not help. I hung it in the closet for a day and still could smell it when I opened the door.  I took it out to the porch hoping that would air it out and at end of the day could still smell it.  I am returning the bag and looking for another.  As I said I really did like the bag and the leather was soft lnside nice.  I kept the wallet I ordered at the same time it was also Fossil but no smell there.  I would have given it one star but except for the smell a nice bag.  Maybe just this one was smelly and another one would be fine.  Who knows????	2015-08-10

I'm one of those people whose feet hurt all the time - until I found these shoes.  The inside is cushioned and the tread is soft as well.  My feet have thanked me many times for purchasing these shoes.  I wouldn't recommend them for outdoor use as asphalt and the like would probably tear the soft tread up pretty quickly.  I wear them inside on a linolium floor.  I've been wearing my current pair for ten months.  The sole does show wear, but they're still remarkably comfortable.  I do have a second brand new pair in a box waiting for my current pair to wear out and will probably by more spares to put away for future use out of fear these may some day no longer be available.  I have never ever had a more comfortable pair of shoes.  I did find the sizes to run a little small and had to go a size bigger than I normally wear.  I recommend going to your local store and try them on and find your correct size and then buy them here for the best price.	2015-08-10

Reviews recommended to buy 1/2 size larger than the regular fit, so i did. I'm flat footed and do prefer my shoe to withstand any swelling of the feet. The bottom of the shoe looks like a rally tire and performed nicely on downhill slopes. The non-lace solution had me wondering what would happen if they just snapped, so i found out that the lace replacement kit is ~$10. Pebbles will also find their way exfoliating your feet during the run, so i suggest getting some trail gaiters for ~$25.<br /><br />The 1 star that i have not included goes to the inner sole. Make sure you cement that sucker down, because it will slip and fold.<br /><br />On a side note, these are definitely a go to when it comes to hiking.	2015-08-10

I bought these for lifting at the gym and they work well.

After reading about all the fakes out there, I decided to purchase directly from Ray-Ban online. I also wanted red with polarized lenses, which they didn't make unless I paid extra for customization. I had tried on many pairs of the RB2132s at Sunglass Hut, in all sorts of colors of frames and lenses, polarized and not, so I knew exactly what I wanted. So disappointed with what came. If I hadn't bought directly from Ray-ban I would have been sure they were fake. They were cheap plastic, and had no metal supports down the temples. They squeak when opening the temples or putting them on. They will no doubt break in short order. Now I see the other reviews that talk about different manufacturing than in the past.  Oh, how I wish I would have read these first.	2015-08-10

[[VIDEOID:cc7597f6bc38fa03257efdec7f046ec8]]I had ordered BG® Women Punk Style Designer Inspired Smooth PU Leather Satchel Handbags - brown and loved it.I own quite a few of their bags and i totally love them all.They are very creative in their designs. The love the pattern which looks lovely n the quality is good for the price. This is a very BEAUTIFUL and GORGEOUS piece.The bag is a good size measuring 15.7in W X 12 in H X 3.91in D same as in displayed in amazon.I like the size and over all look of this purse ...looks very stylish.I loved the handles ..they are a contrast color that's not very common.The design and the color can be perfectly paired with any outfit. Its well made and the stitching is good and its a prices very well.I will use the bag when i need to put in a lot of stuff as there's a lot of organization space as well. You have one main zip compartment which has a large thin center zip compartment, another small zip compartment and 2 pouches within it. On the outside of the bag there is another zip compartment on the back as well.I can put a lot of stuff inside.....The Zipper is of good quality as i felt it was smooth and no issues with the zippers jamming, breaking or tarnishing as of yet.The fabric lining isn't that cheap lining.The Bag looks great and very spacious as in the video , good quality for the price and every girl/women must have this set to go with any style but according to my opinion it will look best with denim wear or winter coats.This being said please remember is a synthetic leather and not Leather.The only issue that i found inb my bag was a awful chemnical odor which could be just in the one received but cant confirm.I guess it few days it should go away. I'd recommend this to friends and family .Its a good quality bag that is very functional.I received this product for free for evaluation and provide for an honest review.I received the bag in two days..amazing shipping.	2015-08-10

Now that I've started a new teaching job, I decided to purchase a couple more pairs to be stylish and comfortable.  The first time I wore them, I found them to slip off the back of my feet a little, AND poke out on both sides of my feet when I walked, but they were so cute I decided I could deal with that.  Then after a while, they started hurting my feet on each side just below my toes.  I thought maybe I just needed to break them in a bit.  No such luck!  I tried to wear them a second time and I couldn't even keep them on my feet for 30 minutes.  They were slipping off AND hurting my feet really bad.  Sad part is I only wore them ONCE, I'm an Amazon employee, and the site says I was supposed to return them by July 18th, 2015!!! Now I'm stuck with this shoe and the silver and white loafer!!:-(  Even though I'm an Amazon employee... I'm stuck with shoes I can't wear, and I'm out of $100 BUCKS!!!  Not good!	2015-08-10

Period.<br /><br />They DO look nice, and go with anything, which is cool, but they're just not that comfortable, don't provide that much support, and the tongues are abnormally long and stick up really high.  Not sure what that's all about.<br /><br />Overall they're just OK.  Look good, and that's about it.	2015-08-10

Make no mistake, in the overall spectrum of shoes these fall in the ugly category but they feel so good I just can't help wearing them.

They are so comfortable and such good quality that they last you years. I love the style of these, they look good with everything and seem to hardly wear. I have had them for almost a year now and they still look new. The only thing I don't like is having to unlace them to put them on and then relace them. Still great shoes and very reasonably priced for Doc Martens since they last so long!!	2015-08-10

With every shoe manufacturer changing models and insoles like diapers, I'm more comfortable barefoot. I gave up on Asics after 20 years, now I can give up on Mizuno.	2015-08-10

They look nice but feel larger than the Size 8.5 Keens I am now wearing.  I may try the Size 8 but am concerned that they will be too small.  I am giving the shoes 3 stars but I can't really evaluate them other than the overall fit. UPDATE:  I ordered the smaller size 8.  They fit well.  The problem with this pair, as reported in other reviews, is that the dye rubs off.  With this pair, it is even on the paper that the shoes are wrapped with inside the Keen box.  I rubbed the strap and the dye came off on my hand.  It did wash off, but I don't know if it would wash out of socks or tights.  It comes off other parts of the shoe but much more from the strap.  This is a problem I have not had with Keen shoes before.  How could quality control miss this??  Do better, Keen.  I really want to wear your shoes.	2015-08-10

Maybe because I'm a size 7 it looks odd - the straps are very wide and closer together than I expected. I think if the straps were half as thick and this had an ankle strap it would be perfect - and something like that probably exists so I just need to keep shopping. I do love Vionic and have purchased (and kept) 3 pairs that I wear regularly (sneakers, flat sandals, and wedges). If you aren't as worried about the look as I was then this isn't a bad pair to have.	2015-08-10

I was very skeptical that Skechers could make a good running shoe.  I have ran in several of the big well-known traditional running shoes like Asics GT-1000, GT-2000, Cumulus, Brooks, New Balance, etc.  I wanted to move to a low heel drop cushion shoe like the Hoka One One, but they were expensive.  On forums I read that the Skechers Go Run Ride was pretty similar to the Hoka Bondi, but costs literally 1/2 the price.  I had to try them.  I only have about 25 miles on them and ran one Olympic triathlon (10k run) race in these so far and I'm really impressed.  They are light and very comfortable.  I was afraid the EVA sole would feel squishy and marshmallowy but it does not, it's cushioned but positive and firm and balanced in absorbing any impact.  Because the sole is softer foam, you can feel rough surfaces more so than some other shoes.  These shoes are responsive and feel like they push back on your foot a bit as you push off.  The toe box is wider than Asics which feels good, your foot can naturally spread out.  Breathable uppers keeps them feeling light and airy.  The difference in heel drop is noticeable compared to a traditional &#34;crash pad&#34; heel.  It encourages you to run with better form and I like it.  I will be ordering more of these and will be rotating through them.  I'm very pleased.  The sizing is close to &#34;real&#34; shoe size, if anything a tad bigger than labelled.  Order at least 1/2 if not a full size smaller than Asics.  I wear a 10.5 - 11 in GT-2000's but a 10 in these Skechers feels good (with the insole installed (without the insole I might even go down to a 9.5).  The liner is nice and could be worn sockless.  With the softer foam sole I anticipate lower mileage but other reviews seem to say they last just as well as other shoes because support and foam will usually break down before the soles wear out anyway.  Regardless, at this price, they could last a lot less and still be a great value.	2015-08-10

These shoes are cute and I've gotten compliments, but there are minor problems. First, the heel of the shoe extends too far beyond the back strap. Almost as if they are a size too big, but they are not. I don't know how good these would be for wider feet. The toe is stitched similar to the little peak in the toes of Dutch shoes. It's an adorable accent, but sometimes I wish the toes were great plain. They are comfy enough for all day and still look cute. I've been wearing them to work with dresses and pants.	2015-08-10

Just put an altoid tin in this and store anything you want	While it may not look like much it fits an altoid tin perfectly. You can keep whatever you like in the altoid tin be it just altoids or a mini fishing or fire kit for camping. All you have to do is when you get it let it air out for 2 days as it does have a leather smell then push the altoids tin inside and give the pouch some time to stretch around it. It works great as you wind up with some room in the top for a lighter and ferro rod then you just fold it closed and preferably stretch the elastic around the top instead of the button. The elastic is somewhat loose when putting it around the button but fits just right when wrapping it around the top. I have bought 3 of these and each one is as good as the others. Ive definitely gotten junky stuff before but this is quality. I even tried to pull it apart but I couldnt. Not a single thread broke. This is definitely something that will last a long time.	2015-08-10

I REPEAT, DO NOT HAVE THE ANTI - FATIGUE TECHNOLOGY. I was never a big fan of Timberland boots until I tried a pair of Timberland Helix and found them to be the one of the most comfortable boots that I have ever worn.With that being said I ordered a pair of the Hyperion boots as Timberland advertises they have the same anti-fatigue technology as the Helix, but does not. I called Timberland direct and they told me that the Hyperion DOES NOT have the anti-fatigue technology but only the ant-fatigue insoles. I told them that their website advertises the boot with anti-fatigue and they didn't have an answer for me.I will be sending them back for a refund and ordering another pair of Helix like I should have done in the first place.( I just wanted to try something with a little different look). If you want real comfort I suggest that you go with the Helix. I was also by Timberland that the only boot the make with the Anti- Fatigue Technology built into the boot is the Helix.I guess the moral of my review is DO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ!!!	2015-08-10

This is a marvelously comfortable pair of slip-on shoes that are true to fit.  Many times I’ve attempted to purchase clothing or shoes online only to be sorely disappointed because the sizing was off (usually too small).  These are listed both in men’s and women’s sizes so selection is easy.  They aren’t narrow by any means and certainly didn’t cramp my feet.  I recently purchased a pair of Merrells and they were a bit on the narrow side.<br /><br />The design is an unusual one with reproductions of an assortment of Americana, ephemera that was rather interesting to say the least.  In one corner I even found a reproduction of an old Disneyland ticket advertising Main Street and Fantasyland.  Distinctive, but solely a matter of taste I suppose.  My daughter-in-law took one look at them and nixed the style.<br /><br />I’m not particularly enamored with the design, but were this in a plain color or age-appropriate design, I’d buy them in a minute.  These, for me at least, would be perfect for beachwear or casual wear.  The support is excellent and I do like the slip-on style.  So very comfortable and easy to wear.  They are 70s and 80s retro, but don’t quite have their target audience perfected with that design.<br /><br />How well are they made?  Surprisingly well made and not at all cheap.  There’s piping around the sole and top line.  There’s an elasticized band on either side which make them easy to slip on.  The insole is quite cushy, comfortable, and the front part is sewn in a pattern that will keep them from disintegrating or falling out.  The designer sole is non-slip with a cool looking tree-like design with roots.  Nope, I don’t like the design, but these slip-on shoes are very well-made and ultra comfortable.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.	2015-08-10

This one, however, looks pretty cheap. Plus, the way it was shipped, the bag had been folded to make the tote lie flat, so now there's a seam across one side. Not sure if it'll fade with time. This is one of those situations where I'm torn between keeping it because I'm too lazy to package it back up and return it, or go through the hassle and send it back. For others who are considering purchasing this tote, I'd recommend that you pass it up and look for something else.	2015-08-10

Bought to use as a work boot but the boot barely lasted 6 months. Already has ripped open at the point where the leather upper and rubber insole lower attach and the sole itself wore out flat.

The first pair I got started unraveling the week after I started wearing them. Thinking it was just a fluke, I filed a claim with Amazon and got another pair. The second pair lasted me 2 months (wearing a couple of days a week to the office) before the leather started to unravel and appeared in spots to just disintegrate. The bottoms are flimsy and started to show major signs of wear also.<br /><br />I have two other pairs of traditional Jack's that I've had for years and have never had a problem with them. I don't know if it's just this Lauren style, or a larger problem with overall quality deterioration, but for $100+ sandals this is absolutely unacceptable. I mean I literally have pairs of $3 flip flops from target last longer than these $125 sandals.	2015-08-10

Although the size was correct for my foot, the top of the boot rubbed at the top of my instep. I could actually feel the stitched leather rubbing on the top of my foot.  The feel of the boot was very unnatural.  Because the heal and sole are a continuous, flat last, the boot feels wierd when walking, kind of stiff and flat footed.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed after reading other reviews.	2015-08-10

Love these shoes, these are actually my 2nd pair. My first pair I bought just for my treadmill, they were so comfortable right out of the box. I bought this pair for walking / jogging with friends, same thing, right out of the box comfort! I have flat feet so I can't speak so much on arch support for others, but for me, shoes with a high or hard arch are very painful and I usually end up giving those shoes away. These are just really comfortable with what I find to be a comfortable arch. I have found my self wearing them more then just for exercise because they are so comfortable and I have recently noticed I've worn down the tread (I walk a lot!) Looks like I'm about ready for another pair! Humm, what color do I want next ;-)	2015-08-10

First, the navy shoes are not navy. They are more of a cobalt blue - much brighter and at least 2 shades lighter than navy. I love that color so I'll wear them with other things but they definitely don't work with my navy blue outfits so i still have to find a pair of navy shoes. Secondly, the straps across the toes are uncomfortable and i had to add foam padding to the underside. But they are so attractive and the arch support and sole are so comfortable, i still love the shoes and have to give them 4 stars!  One more thing - i have a true AA foot, but the adjustable strap across the toes fits just right. That is, when i fasten the velcro of the strap across the toes to fit me, the edges of the top and bottom strips align exactly, with no excess hanging over. Because of that i believe these shoes are a bit narrow across the toes...I have a lot of B width shoes with velcro straps, and with all of them i have at least 1&#34; of excess strap when i align the velcro across toes. that works great for me but may not work for others. (i do see the normal amount of excess on the midfoot and heel straps, so they both seem to be consistent with B width). As for the length, they about 1/2 size longer than usual.	2015-08-10

I recently went on a trip to Europe for 2 weeks, walking was my main use of getting around. My feet are usually very sensitive and ache easily but not once did I experience any foot pain with these shoes. They were perfect! Even after wearing them for two weeks straight and with many hours of walking, they're still in great condition.<br /><br />One thing to note is that I believe they run a size too small. I'm usually a 6.5 but I ordered a size 7 to be safe, and they fit very well!	2015-08-10

Love the design as it lets you wear sneaker style shoes and not have your feet get hot I summer time. Very cute.  Only downside for me to this shoe is the footbed (bottom of the shoe) is not as comfortable as I expected and have come to love about Anne Klein casual Shoes. My daughter and I both found the bottom to be a little hard. Not for &#34;all day&#34; comfort if doing a lot of walking.  But good for a couple of hours.

I find that the size 37, which I wear consistently,  fits quite large.  It is somewhat too wide and too long for my foot.

Usually wear a 10 in regular shoes and 11 in athletic shoes as I need a wider toe box and wear custom orthotics. The 11 was huge, just sort of flopped around on my foot. Didn't have what I wanted in a 10.5 so took a chance and ordered the 10. Sure enough, fits perfectly even with the orthotics, although it is still a little loose in the heel area. Very lightweight and comfy. Wore them all day past two days, no problems	2015-08-10

On the range they fit perfectly and feel great. On the course, I consistently get blisters on the heels on both feet and end up limping by around the 4th hole. I have to put band aids under my socks in order to finish the round. I have tried to work out why this happens - they fit perfectly and are the correct size - and worked out that the blisters are exactly the spot where the leather of the upper heel joins with the soft padding at the top of the shoe. The join creates a bump at the back of the shoe which is causing the blisters. In the past I wore less fashionable and cheaper Footjoys and had no problems with them. I really regret being swayed by the looks of these $200 plus shoes as they have proved to be very dissapointing. I would return them if I could - and should have done so after my first round in them - but keep hoping that they would wear in. They haven't!	2015-08-10

Yes, the size 9 to get a fit for 6.5 wide.  This means they are a bit long on my foot.  I originally ordered them in the women's equivalent size 8 As other reviewers mentioned that these ran small, but they were still way too tight across the foot.  The longer length also allowed me to get my heel in a better place on the sole of the shoe.  When the foot sits on the actual heel cup, there is a tendency to feel like you are pitching backwards.  All in all, I needed the shoes to help recover from a foot injury, these have a very cushy feel that is comforting to the foot, yet provide very good arch support.  In the end they serve the purpose, but the sizing is weirder than weird, and seems the option of wider widths would really help level it out.  Also, these sandals work much better without socks.  Because of the rubbery material they are made of, it is hard to get a sock to slide into the sandal without getting stretched or bunching up.	2015-08-10

She just started wearing them, so we have yet to see how the velcro will hold up. So far, so good.  By the way, Silvert's also sells these shoes directly for the same price, but charge for shipping.  Amazon's shipping was free.	2015-08-10

I wore these on an easy hike to break them in, but I didn't even really need to.  The arch support feels fantastic. I like that my ankles felt supported and there was no blisters or rubbing anywhere.  I am so happy with these.<br /><br />For the size, I was confused as to which one would be good for me.  I wear a size 7-7.5 depending on the shoe.  I purchased both the size 7.5 and 8 in these boots.  The 8 was a little too loose, even with thick socks.  The 7.5 was perfect.  It was loose enough to have some wiggle room, but they felt secure on my feet.  I do have narrow feet and I thought the 8 were too wide.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy on my Keen hiking boots and will purchase these again when my pair breaks down.	2015-08-10

I wore these on a couple of local hikes/trails in my area before taking them on vacation to the Mammoth/June Lake area. I've been building up my running/hiking stamina for a few months now, not having ever been much of a runner/hiker. With my running, the shoes made all the difference, and I can definitely say that with the hiking, the right shoes make a HUGE difference. I felt confident, stable, and pain-free on each of the daily (all-day) hikes we did while there, and these Salomons were perfect for me!!  I'm 57 years old, and kept saying over and over how happy I was to have great shoes. I love the traction, I love the comfort & support, I love the look, but most of all I can say that they have made a very large contribution in my new-found love for hiking!!	2015-08-10

First the tiny bit of warning you need - these run a little small, but are perfect 1/2 size to 1 size up. Now for the good - EVERYTHING else! Seriously, these hiking shoes are the first ones I've ever owned that are absolutely ready to comfortably put high miles on right out of the box.<br /><br />I hiked for two days (about 3-4 hours each day), on all kinds of terrain with these right out of the box. Not a single blister, my feet felt great the entire time, they felt great after. The traction on mixed surfaces was wonderful, the stability on varying trails (from muddy to rocky, incline, decline)...I couldn't ask for anything more in a hiking shoe. I hope they keep making this model, because it's perfect.<br /><br />My husband actually bought this model as well in the men's shoe, and he was equally as thrilled with his (and he also had to go up a size).	2015-08-10

I normally wear a size 9.5, sometimes 10, so I ordered a 40, since that is what I usually wear in European sizes (and the seller even states that size will work when you're ordering). Unfortunately, they are too small. The toebox is really tight. The material is stretchy and I thought that might help but after wearing them for a few hours, they were just too tight. Order a size larger than you may need and you'll end up with a really cute, comfy shoe.	2015-08-10

They would be appropriate for a weekend getaway where you wanted to throw them away afterward providing you were walking only short distances.<br /><br />Design<br />- The sole is satisfactory and should protect from rocks, including side brushes<br />- The enclosure does not tighten the overall shoe like laces or velcro would, instead it tightens the top around your ankle. That keeps the shoe from coming off but if you tighten it for significant walking you'd better expect lines on the ankle and pain later<br />- The tightening ball does not really keep the string tight when wet<br />- The ball bounces against the back of the ankle when the string is wet<br /><br />Implementation<br />- Sole is good in implementation as well as design. No real issues with the top netting<br />- The glue attaching the very thin foam to the inside of the shoe was faulty. The foam completely detached after a day and let the foam slide which it did. Removing the foam exposes your feet to the inside stitching and eliminates all cushion.<br /><br />Overall - get something else. Better options are available at similarly low cost.	2015-08-10

I often end up with a size 12 that is too roomy, especially after I wear them in.<br /><br />I wore these shoes around the house for a day or two and they felt snug in the toes but otherwise ok.  Then I wore them to work, after 4 hours on a hard floor my feet felt crushed and the toes on my right foot which is shorter than my left hurt so much I drove home barefoot.  Not at all what I expected from my &#34;preview&#34; wear.  I ordered another pair in size 12 because the shoe seems to provide good support and is sturdier than the mesh toed NB's I''m looking to replace.	2015-08-10

I will say, it is a well structured bag with lots of compartments. I use it for work and I do like it, I even fit my laptop in it and it's holding up well.

This is due to the adjustability of the laces.  The pieces at the top though are sewn together so you can't adjust the width there.  Something to note, the soles of these shoes are rigid.  They don't flex like Clark's or Born.  So, the flaxseed  cushion that is touted is very thin as it sits atop this rigid base that doesn't give when you walk or stand in them.  Given that flaw, this is a beautiful shoe that draws compliments whenever I wear them.  Just realize that it may not be a shoe that will comfortable if you have to a lot of standing or walking.	2015-08-10

I have a hard time finding shoes to fit well due to bunions that I was so lucky to inherit from my grandmother.  I exhasperated them by wearing heals too much also,  so it's hard to find an athletic shoe that doesn't hurt my feet after a while.  I noticed that these had a wider toe box and I decided to give them a try.  I went up a 1/2 size to add to the comfort and they fit wonderfully.  I have been having a reoccurring ankle problem,  so I decided to go back to some high tops like I used to wear a lot when I was younger.  The added support on my ankle has helped a lot.  Normally,  after a couple of hours,  my ankle starts swelling and getting sore,  but the support with these has kept that from happening.  So these ended up being a great shoe for me.  They are pretty much true to size and very comfortable.  In fact,  I like them so much that I ordered another pair.	2015-08-10

I ordered these with the hope that they would offer a bit more relief than the old ones and they did. They are wonderful. I wear them every where, every day, all day. I have developed a callous where the back strap (closest to the ankle) rubs but it never hurt or blistered. I do not have any pain in my heel when I wear these sandals.

I was not certain I would like the memory foam in these Sketchers, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a great feel with excellent shock resistance.

Shrank to the point where even if I squeeze my foot into it, they'll pop off within a few steps.  Needless to say they're useless now.  The &#34;Vertico&#34; label became unglued at this time too.

The shoe seems very well made, and it's super cute! There is a subtle sparkle to the blue denim area that doesn't really show in the photos, and the colored dots are more fluorescent then I expected. They are fun! Girlie flair without being over the top pink-on-pink. There is good flex at the ball of the foot, so okay for a more advanced early walker — but overall the sole is probably too stiff for a beginning walker. The way the inside construction is, it seems like a shoe that should be worn with socks.<br /><br />The shoe is a little bigger then I expected, but they'll likely fit in the next month or so. I'll update review if anything to add once we wear them.	2015-08-10

We lost 1 of his pre-walker sandals. Since he was very close to walking, I decided to replace that pre-walker pair with this pair (Brice). Unfortunately, the opening to the Brice sandal was too small to allow my son's foot to slide into the sandal. When we tried a size larger, his foot fit past the opening, but the length of the sandal was far too long. Both sizes had to be returned.<br /><br />We ended up with See Kai Run sandals, which accommodated my son's &#34;cankles.&#34;	2015-08-10

Because I own this same shoes in a different color, and that other pair is in perfect shape.<br /><br />Look. They look awesome.<br />Feel. The leather is comfy, but thin.<br />Quality. Big boo boo...<br /><br />This pair ripped up the top after just 8 months of moderate to little use. Leather is trickier in terms of maintaining a standard. So I guess I was just out of luck.

It's so classy and stylish. I got the one in the brown/tan leather color. The bag comes in a pristine condition and arrives within a week. The strap is packed inside the bag. The length of the strap can be adjusted as desired using the buckle. The is strap on top the bag also if you want to carry it in your hand instead of like a cross-body bag. The are buckle accents on the front of the bag as well. No pockets on outside to keep the design simple. The flap closes with 2 magnetic buttons in the front. There is pocket in the front and then the main compartment. There is a zipped small hidden pocket inside and card slots as well. The leather is of amazing quality. It smooth and stitched together nice and neat. You can pair this bag with any color of dress for any occasion.<br />Sample provided without any obligations.	2015-08-10

These are the Gaby Shoes in Grey Snake. They have a 4 1/2 inch heal with extra heel tips! No one ever included extra heel tips, so an added bonus. I got a size 6.5 and it's a perfect fit. The color is fantastic and well made. Looks like other expensive brands for a not so expensive price! The bottom is a wood grain like color that goes well with the snake skin and compliments the shoe. I cannot wait to wear these on date nights- let the dancing commence. The lining is not cushioned but that is an easy fix with a padded insert you can find anywhere. I love these heels so much I want other colors. Highly recommended by this high heel shoe lover.<br />I did receive this product at a 50% discount for my honest unbiased review.	2015-08-10

I can feel pretty confident wearing them during physical activity too.  I have a big head, and they still fit perfectly.  They're not too tight or too lose where I fear them falling off my head.  I'd say they're a one size fits all without fuss.  If you've never gotten sunglasses better than your cheaper, plastic drug store versions you should really consider these.<br /><br />For picture and color references, my pair is black.

I have to say I'm not sure what design has been changed but these are the best pair I've ever owned.<br />First and foremost, the aesthetic appeal. I'm one who doesn't really care what my &#34;comfy&#34; shoes look like. I'm wearing them because i want to be able to walk long distances, not because they're cute. However these surpass expectation. I get several compliments on them, and the color is bright yet subdued enough that they're easy to match to.<br />I'm a fan of slip ons, so these are really easy to throw on and go. The most surprising thing about these though is i can actually RUN in them! Yes, run at speed. Without worrying about one flying off. They hold up on different terrains okay (obviously not recommended for rocky terrain, but if you're looking for shoes for rocky terrain and you wound up here, you may want to investigate your hobby further), and even do a decent job crossing slick surfaces while wet.<br />The main reason I purchased these was for a family vacation to disneyland. In my first true day of wearing them, my pedometer had 18 miles on it before my phone died. I was able to get up and do the exact same thing the next day. These shoes provided excellent support and have maintained the comfort.<br /><br />I will be buying future pairs in different colors as these are the best investment in my closet I've made.	2015-08-10

I have flat feet and I bought into the philosophy that flat-footed runners need extra arch support.  The problem I always encountered was that the extra arch support would cause high pressure points on the arches and after a few miles, blister city.  After seeing a sports doctor and getting pointed to a runners shoe store with very knowledgable staff, I got setup with these shoes, which basically have minimal arch support and are the right width for my feet.  Blisters are history and I've gone from suffering through 5k's to doing half-marathons without issue.	2015-08-10

The seamless upper is very comfortable. And it looks very good!  I've run about 60k in these shoes thus far. The upper is amazing. Holds the feet well like a glove, yet wide in the forefoot to allow for toe splay. The transition is very smooth and inforesee this is a good shoe for long races up to a marathon. Have tried them on light trails and grip is good enough, but with Rocky paths, the shoe tends to flex too much.  After only 60k, the heel wear is significant. Tradeoff for the cushioning and smooth heel to toe transition perhaps.	2015-08-10

I’m a grad student who also works on campus, so I needed a bag that would carry all my school stuff but also look professional. I have been attracted to the dome shaped satchels for quite some time, and was over the moon when I saw this bag for the price.<br /><br />The shape is very clean and modern. It is also well made and study, and is big enough to hold my chromebook (this is a smaller laptop, not certain if the Macbook would fit) and all my books and notebooks for class. The straps are big enough that I can easily loop my arm through it and carry it even up on my shoulder comfortably. It comes with an attachable/detachable crossbody strap as well. The inside lining is decently done (seems to be a cheaper material, but not a big deal at all for me) and does come with additional sewn in pockets for your phone, etc.<br /><br />Overall, I am completely in love, as this bag fulfills all my needs for school and work. This bag looks like a designer-brand and has the durability of one, yet is at an incredible price. I even bought a second bag as a back up, and may additionally splurge on the brown bag.  :)	2015-08-10

The most comfortable pair I've found to use while inside a concreted floor plant.

In other words, there is more &#34;sole&#34; on one side of the sandal than the other when I am wearing them. My foot doesn't stay in the middle. Maybe it's me. But I've not experienced that before. So they are comfortable, but look a little bit funny, I think.<br />I&#34;m still giving them a shot, though.	2015-08-10

The color of it and the clean lines go with everything from professional outfits to casual weekend looks. For me though, looks don't matter much if the functionality isn't there. I'm happy to report this purse is not only beautiful, but thoughtfully put together for optimal organization. The two pockets on the outside of the purse are deep but quite tight, so they are not ideal for keeping a cell phone or keys in as I thought they might be. You could certainly use them for that, but I would worry that the pockets would stretch out and cause the bag to wear more quickly. However, do not despair. Inside there is a large zippered pouch on one side, and dual pockets on either side of the bag. One side has two pockets that are cell-phone sized and can easily accommodate any device. The other side has one slightly smaller pocket and one slightly bigger pocket. The larger one is perfect for car keys, while I use the small one for lip glosses and such. No more rummaging around for those pesky smaller items that seem to fall into the mysterious bermuda triangle that live in all tote purses. Thank you to the practical geniuses at Michael Kors for your generous use of purse pockets!! The remaining space in the purse can easily fit a tablet or book along with all the other necessities. I am a little concerned by some of the other reviewers who reported straps breaking, but they appear to be well constructed and considering everything this bag has to offer, I am willing to take the risk.	2015-08-10

I don't know why I keep doing it, but shoes never look like the photos when they arrive. These are lightweight, flat-soled shoes with little in the way of support. Best for kicking around the house, town or camp, but I don't know if I'd hike in them. Most of my shoes are hiking or running type shoes, which have a bit of heel in them, though it's not always apparent. These are FLAT-soled, like Chuck Taylors or something. I wear them to work, which is fine. They go well with Levis. I do like the styling, they are unique, but still look outdoorsy. I guess most Patagonia footwear is stylistically apart from the crowd.	2015-08-10

My feet are, shall we say, sensitive - I can get a blister walking 25 feet with the world's tiniest pebble in my shoe. Two years ago my family went to Disneyland and by the end of the first day I had several blisters from wearing cheap shoes. I bought these in anticipation of another theme park visit, this time with tons of hills (Silver Dollar City). The shoes felt broken in the minute I put them on. We put on 5+ miles per day for 4 days and my feet gave me absolutely no trouble.<br /><br />I am dealing with the early stages of plantar fasciitis and I think these shoes are really going to help prevent further pain. They are soft, supportive and breathable. I love them.	2015-08-10

Once you find the right size Birkenstock, you will always be able to order the same size in any style.These are amazing, very trendy right now, but will stay in style forever. Might be a good idea to go to a Birkenstock retailer and be properly fitted. I hear people complain about their Birks, saying they &#34;aren't all that&#34;. Come to find out they are wearing the wrong size, either too narrow or too short.<br />I love this style. I'm a flip flop person, so this particular style ticks that box, and yet adds a lot of style to ANY outfit. Linen skirts, jeans, linen pants, shorts. You name it, I wear Birks with it. I will keep buying them as new colors and materials are coming out with each season.	2015-08-10

My 2 year old has uber fat feet, and can only wear Pedipeds, which is a drag cuz Nike, New Balance, Converse, etc. all make CRAZY CUTE shoes for little guys.<br /><br />Thankfully my wife and I found Pedipeds, as they look just as cute as shoes from the other guys, but they also fit his (adorable) little sausage feet.  This particular pair has more of a hiking boot look to them (like tiny Merrells or something), but Pediped also makes sneakers that are totes adorbs.<br /><br />Also very happy with how well these hold up, as he continues to outgrow them LONG before they fall apart, or even really get dirty.  Can't go wrong with Pedipeds, and we'll keep buying them until my poor little guy grows into his (incredibly cute) sasquatch feet.  :)	2015-08-10

I will have to update this review after my hiking trip, but so far these shoes were the best fit out of the 4 pairs that I ordered. They are a little wide, but the laces can be tightened to make them fit around the foot while still having lots of room in the toe box, which is important for up and downhill hiking. They are also surprising compact for how roomy they are. They look small on your feet, but provide lots of space inside. Even though there are no insoles in these shoes, they have a pretty high arch support, and are also roomy enough that you could add your own insole if you wanted. I ordered my street size and they fit fine.	2015-08-10

And because the sole has traction but give, they are much better for secure walking for those of us who are older and a bit clumsy. I fell recently in a stiff, hard rubber wedge. That would not have happened with these. I get many compliments as they look in style with the bootie look. Very pleased.	2015-08-10

A pair of good shoes, although the support on the kid versions of Toms are nothing compared to adult versions.  Purchased because it was cheaper and fit the same as very small adult sizes.  You get what you pay for because it had no support. I would not wear it more than 4-6 hours.  If I had kids and they reached this foot size, I would probably start buying them adult versions because it was so uncomfortable.

Where, oh where have these shoes been all my life...I so needed this kind of support. I have painfully flat feet, lots of issues due to that pain, have had ugly orthotics made for my feet which helps but I have had many years that I could only wear them in tennis shoes. Not at all satisfying to my very girly nature...3 days after total bi-lateral knee replacement, suffered a broken MCL which had to be totally repaired 1 wk. after knee surgery, therefore, that knee never worked the same wonderful way my other knee has, and after the first year of misery in that foot, surgical repair was necessary when the foot was almost taken off and turned and kept in place with a 4&#34; screw, still there after 9 yrs. I feel this Orthaheeled shoe will be my final answer. The foot surgery was healing, but very little flexibility. Now, 10 yrs. later, it's time for that knee to be replaced again due to lack of support of MCL...After this next knee surgery, I feel I can look forward to a much better feeling, mentally and physically...and in my old age, enjoy cute shoes by Vionic	2015-08-10

I've tried other brands but always come back to Asics. These are the top-of-the-line Nimbus and I guess what makes them top is they have the most cushion, which is what I wanted. I use these for training and racing and usually put about 30~40 miles of running in per week training and racing half and full Ironman (13.1~26.2 miles). I have several pairs of Nimbus shoes that I rotate and these are one of them. They are extremely comfortable and &#34;cushiony&#34; and good for long runs. Since they are very expensive, I generally just buy 1 or 2 models back and don't worry about the color, just get the cheapest in my size, that will save you a few bucks. I have also used the &#34;Kayano&#34; model but feel the Nimbus have more cushion and feel better than the Kayano's (for me).	2015-08-10

The elastics were initially a bit tight, so I switched over to laces until I needed to race in the shoes, at which point the extra grip from the elastic helped as I opted to go sockless for my race.<br /><br />When training with them for my speedwork days & pace runs, the support was definitely reduced vs. my heavier duty shoes, and I was feeling rocks more when running on trails. Still, the lighter weight helped my pickup, and seemed to help with speed.<br /><br />For my first triathlon with them, I was stuck in a city without my bike, and true to the &#34;swim, bike, run&#34; words plastered all over the shoe design, I actually used them for both the bike & run. I'm pretty sure that the USAT wouldn't approve them for the swim leg anyhow.<br /><br />Flying out of the swim, I very quickly slid the shoes on without socks, strapped on my helmet, put on my sunglasses and exited the transition area, posting a time within 8 seconds of the T1 leader (who likely just did a flying bike start with clipless pedals clipped in). For the ride, with track pedals and half clips, they soles held up despite hammering pretty hard on my climbs, although these aren't as rigid as normal bike shoes.<br /><br />Coming out of the bike, my feet were dry (as they seemed to air out on the ride) and I just opted to keep the shoes on without socks, racked my bike & helmet, sprinting out of T2, and posted the fastest transition time out of the 250 competitors in my race (and fastest combined transition time). Racing the 5K in them went pretty well, as I posted a faster pace/time than my pre triathlon 5 mile race. Still, by the end of the 5k, I could tell the bottom of my feet weren't as happy due to the limited support, and I don't think a marathon is in the shoes' future.<br /><br />In short, they actually work pretty well for triathlons (even sockless), and the lighter weight/lower profile design seemed to help with speed.	2015-08-10

These boots are wonderful! I love the soft leather and the nice calf fit, they are loose enough for pants or to wear them rolled down as stated in the description. They feel roomy in the bottom half I think because of the style of the loose fitting calf. I still own two pairs of the made in england docs that I've had for over 15 years, and one pair of the newer rain boot docs, so I knew what to expect with the fit and the size on these. They are just exactly what I expected and I am happy to have scored them for a good deal. Very Happy. :)	2015-08-10

They run about half a size to a size too small. I have these in size 10W but I normally wear a 9.5EE, and they are tight and snug all around. However I usually wear hiking shoes with half an inch allowance between my toes and the toe box, so these will be quite constricted with thick socks(but manageable using thin socks).<br /><br />The color and styling is nice, and the uppers are very durable (no stitching is falling apart). The Vibram sole is also durable (wear and tear also minimal). But the biggest gripe I have (as well as other Merrell hiking shoes with Vibram soles) is that the adhesive that glues the outersole and the midsole deteriorates over time, and completely separates from the shoe. One pair I had took less than 3 years to do so, this Moab Ventilator managed a good five years. They can still be used provided you stick back the Vibram outersole using Shoe Goo, and they will likely last at least another year or two.<br /><br />This particular pair is not waterproofed (no Goretex or similar inner membrane), so water seeps into the sock after a downpour. I would recommend the Goretex variant of the Moab Ventilator and that I will rate 5 stars. But for this one, 4 stars means it is good enough and worth your money over the long haul.	2015-08-10

They are comfortable in the toe box because of that but since I have narrow ankles, they are a little roomy in the back.<br /><br />The insides are a gold slick material so I recommend a thin insole/insert to help with sweating and sliding.<br /><br />I really love these shoes and will probably get a few more pairs in other colors, but may take a chance on ordering my true size.<br /><br />Love the thick platform, too. Always helps when the heel is that high.<br /><br />Note - There does seem to be a small pressure point on the top of my left foot where a seam is. I'm hoping it will soften or I'll need to get some moleskin to place there.	2015-08-10

They do run a bit small (and my foot skews slightly narrow), and I wear orthotics, so I actually went up a full size and I'm glad I did-- I like a bit of room in my boot for when the temperatures start to plummet here. But right now it's summer, and they're just delightful with a regular sock and my dresses and jeans. I kept the Grey Soft because I wanted a bit of a slouch in the shaft, and the leather on the Burnished doesn't do this (I've got a super-wide calf, so the Soft are more flattering on my leg, though the Burnished did fit comfortably). For me, they were comfortable right out of the box. I love them.	2015-08-10

Unfortunately, when I went back to check my order, the picture that looks like Navy is named 'Chocolate'. However when I looked up other shoes with the name chocolate for this brand, they do look different than the picture I originally based my order on so just beware and look closely at the color names (not the pictures when you are ordering).	2015-08-10

I was pleasantly surprised that for both of the days that they provided ample support for my feet. The first day was a fairly flat and easy 7 mile hike, and the second day was an 11 mile hike with both uphill and downhill inclines. I was worried that these shoes would not be of very good quality, since I bought them for $45 and the padding seemed a bit thin, but I have walked away without any blisters or foot soreness. As for the fit of the shoe it was not true to my actual size. Normally I wear a size 7.5 to 8. I ended up buying a size 7, although a size 6.5 fit my foot too. I decided to go with a 7 in order to allow for my feet to swell during my hike. The only real issue that I have with these shoes is that the traction on the front of the shoe is already peeling away from the shoe. Overall this shoe was a good investment for the price. I am sure there are better quality shoes out there, but just for doing casual hiking I think that these suffice.	2015-08-10

The cushioning-to-weight ratio is about as good as I've ever seen before -- you wouldn't expect to get this much support to the heel with a shoe this light.	2015-08-10

Definitely keep my feet protected from gross stuff, but they don't have any slip resistance, so I don't know if they make a good rain boot. I have thick calves and had trouble finding waterproof boots that fit, but these are fine.<br /><br />The only issue is they run a little small and they don't have half sizes. I wear a women's 9 1/2, the first pair I bought were 9s and they were too small and ended up tearing after half a year from the pressure on the seams from being too small.

I have about 40 miles in them so far and it's all trail work. The trails have been a mixture of bone dry and wet . The shoes have performed fantasticly  in all the conditions that I have thrown at them. The feel of the shoes on the trail is very unique to me.  You definitely get that feeling of running on a cloud, but with no rock plate in the shoe you can definitely feel the terrain under your feet. So if you hit a sharp rock you're going to definitely  through the shoe. Not in a bad way but you definitely get more trail feel with the shoe that I have with any of the other trail shoes I have used. That would include the hoka  Stinson Trail, Challenger ATR, and Sockin he Peregrin four Challenger ATR, and saucony peregrine 4's.  If you're looking for the hoka  feel in a decently lightweight running shoe with very good off-road traction this would be the shoe to look very closely at	2015-08-10

The size fits exactly as expected,. The shoes are made of leather and have a rubber sole that makes it easy to walk on wet surfaces without slipping and getting wet.

On August 8, 2015, I noticed that there is a tear in the footbed on the left sandal, near the big toe.  I bought these because I was told, by several people, that these sandals are built to last.  That has not been my experience, clearly.  I contacted their customer support, and I have to pay to ship these to them.  My guess is that they will repair/replace the left sandal, free of charge, and ship them back to me.  Still, I'm further disappointed that I have to pay to ship the sandals to them.<br /><br />Also, these are extremely difficult to adjust.  I literally had to use a vise grips to adjust them.  I read one review where the person used soapy water, and was then able to adjust them.  I may have to try that when I get them back from Chaco's repair department.	2015-08-10

I didn't even know a product like this existed.  I have a leather purse that wasn't cheap and it looked like new, but unfortunately, they put a cheap plastic handle on it that totally shredded and looked awful.  I was going to take it to a purse and shoe repair place, but I wasn't sure they'd have the leather, so I checked online and saw the link to Amazon.  I really like this product.  It's sturdy leather and clips on easily.  Even though the purse is crinkly leather and the handle is smooth, they work together very well.  I am very satisfied and hope to keep using the purse for another 4 or 5 years.	2015-08-10

A really poor design: the nose pieces are huge, a full ½ an inch wide, so they bump into my regular glasses and won’t slide up on my nose to really block out any sun.

I loved them and they are the most comfortable sandal I've ever owned.  The only problem I had was that one sandal wore out more than the other,  The right sandal looked almost brand new after three years of wear while the left sandal was cracked and chunks of the bottom were wore completely worn away.

Got over 450 miles in the first pair before they began to show wear. They are made with a very open non-fabric mesh in the toe box that allows for great air circulation and quick drying time after a run. The heel area of the shoe is glow-in-the-dark and reflective for dawn/dusk runs on roads. They aren't heavy, but have more material than the minimalist running shoes, particularly in the sole, which is important if you are running on asphalt and you don't want the bottoms of your shoes to disintegrate after 250 miles. Highly recommend.	2015-08-10

I would have given it four stars if it had only been a bit bigger.  It isn't large enough for me to use as an everyday bag.  This is the third Sak bag I have purchased and they are made very well.  My guess is that most people could get away with this bag as an every day bag but I tend to carry too much in my pocketbooks.  I have enjoyed using this bag on the weekends or when I go out to dinner.  Constructed very well with lots of places to put items.	2015-08-10

I am 55 yrs old & a bit over weight. I read that these shoes could be worn with or without socks but there is no way I could wear socks in these shoes (maybe hose)…there was some trouble putting them onto my bare feet!  Once on, my pinky toes felt cramped in the wrong direction, so I tried again, using some talc this time & that seemed to help quite a bit.  Usually when I shop for shoes, I avoid ones with soles that are not flexible. These shoes offer NO GIVE whatsoever but even so, they are not the least comfy pair I’ve worn but they aren't the most comfy, either.  They do look amazing on my feet, though! The heel shape & height are perfect for me. They give me the lift, yet are manageable enough to walk in without my feeling that I might tip over - even going uphill!	2015-08-10

I would definitely recommend going for the wide version of the shoe if you have wide feet!<br /><br />They are super cute on, though, and I got tons of compliments.

I have high arches	I purchased these sneakers because I take a cardio dance (like zumba) class and dance classes.  I ordered the size that I would usually get in a gym sneaker, and they were a perfect fit.  I have high arches, and was concerned about that.  I have worn the sneakers to two cardio dance classes, one dance class, and a turbo kick class.  So far, I love them.  They are light weight and work great for the zumba-like moves that we do in cardio class, and have helped my spins in dance class.  With my other gym sneakers, I found myself hopping to make the spins,  but with the spin spot on the sneaker, the spins are easier.  I did not like them for turbo kick class, as I found I was slipping when I was kicking, but I thought I would try them out to see.  I purchased them specifically for the dancing, and they are perfect, so far!  I have already had a couple of my friends at the gym ask me about them, and I have highly recommended these sneakers.	2015-08-10

Sole being fused there has been zero pull away which is amazing after a year. Epx feels great. I work 8 to 18 hours a day standing on cement floor and these boots are amazingly comfortable the whole time. Truly keeps water and dirt out. Reasonably light weight for a reinforced toe boot. Great non slip soles.<br /><br />Cons-<br />The leather on the toe got cut and scratched really easily in only a couple weeks detracting from the appearance,  the lace hooks at the top would have been better if they were riveted on eyelets like the rest of the boot or regular eyelets.  The hooks catch on pants and other things at work and are a hazard at times.<br /><br />Note I took these hiking one time to see how these would do. I know they are work boots but was an experiment.<br />Waterproof - yes<br />Dirt - kept dirt and rocks out<br />Fatigue - comfortable but noticeably too heavy for hiking in the end<br />Support - great felt excellent around ankles<br />Traction - great never slipped on any terrain.<br /><br />Even with the cons in normal work situations I would say 5 stars and I hope to see this line continue with small improvements. I would but again.	2015-08-10

But I'm short and I can't sit flat footed on my motorcycle . So I found these with a 2&#34; heel and thicker sole. They did the trick I can now set flat footed on my bike.

Tight fit at first, but that is expected with this type of boot and should be desired over it being loose at first. I only paid $70 for these and I can highly recommend them at that price to anyone. But at the full price of $250 or so I might shop around a lot more. I have been wanting to order another pair in brown but am probably going to wait for a sale.<br /><br />I have people either love these and compliment me, or people be confused about them; either way I like them.<br /><br />The construction is not good-year welted, but it still quite great. The soles have held well to an urban environment with the traction improving with use because the leather soles were quite slippery on the first few wears.	2015-08-10

I couldn't find this style in a store near me but I was able to try on the Hi Top Back Zip.  I don't know if that shoe had been tried on and damaged, but when I walked, my heel would cause the back zipper to come unzipped.  That sealed my choice for me so I ordered these super cute double fringe with the side zip.  I love them!  If you need arch support these won't work for you.  They are narrow, but the leather gives and they are very comfortable. They size is my typical size 8, but I also have a pair of regular Minnetonka moccasins (Kilty) that I purchased from a local store and they are a size 7 1/2.  The 8 in those slipped on and off my heel when I walked.  I would definitely recommend a soft heal pad in either shoe because they don't feel so awesome on the heel.  Lesson learned the hard way :(	2015-08-10

These are great looking classic aviators. My chief concern out of the box was going to be the size - more than other sunglasses aviators are sensitive of their size versus your head. But these fit my larger head beautifully. The frames on my face appeared neither too small or too large. These are very comfortable, and frankly I'd be comfortable keeping them on for a run as well, they fit well so I'm not worried they would go flying or anything. The glasses also have nice, conservative detailing. I really appreciate it when a brand doesn't over do it. If you have never gotten sunglasses better than cheaper, plastic types then consider these. Its a better investment in the long run I feel.<br /><br />For color reference, I bought the Metallic Smoke version.

Would have preferred a firmer footbed and a tighter fit up top but I don't walk around a lot in these so I guess they'll do for now.  The sole is slippery compared to the Timberland ones which I preferred.  I might have bought the Merrill's if the footbed on those slides were flat. I don't like the birkenstock design. Those hurt!  I also don't like memory foam and prefer rubber, eva, or latex in the footbed.  Memory foam does not provide good cushioning and get hot.  It's great as a marketing feature in theory because a few people like to sleep on the material, but not me.	2015-08-10

Must be something in the design of the shoe that must be flawed. Now she has a $150 pair of shoes that she cannot wear and can't return to amazon because time has passed according to the return  policy.Amazon and Geox should  look into this so it won't happen to anyone else.These were the second Geox shoes I purchased thru amazon. According to wife first pair are terrific.As a frequent Amazon customer it would be nice to get some type of compensation due to this unfortunate Geox purchase.	2015-08-10

Never wore heels before...now I can't take them off.<br /><br />I would never have guessed that a sport shoe company like Teva would ever venture into heels, but these are brilliant. I have never worn heels (though I like them) because I refuse to have sore feet that can't walk normally. These are game changers. They are extremely comfortable, stylish, the straps are real leather (YAY) and the footbed is some weird version crossover that seems to be a crossover of rubber / polymer / cork (I'm grasping here and making that part up as I go along...it's definitely man-made)...but it's firm enough to hold your weight, but seems to absorb the impact (at least, I never feel any impact). My feet don't get tired, I can walk as much as I want and feel great. (Generally, if I can walk, I will; I don't like moving my car for every errand).<br /><br />I will say that on a recent tourist trip, I did not take these and chose the flat, sport shoe Tevas, but all-day sightseeing on cobblestones lugging camera, etc. seemed to be a fools errand in any heels.	2015-08-10

(1/2 size larger than street shoes) The heal cup is deep with good cushioning and narrow enough to keep on.  Toebox is wide but still tight for my bunipns-however better than any other brand I have worn.  This is a motion control shoe which I need for one foot due to bunion causing over-pronation but not for other foot so have pain on outer side of foot- Lesson learned is purchase shoes for neutral foot and added an orthotic to overpronation side if feet are different.  If you need the support this is a great shoe!	2015-08-10

I bought these for my daughter prior to a vacation where we would be at a water park most days. They are very stylish looking, the bottoms of the soles are a really good quality and showed little to no wear after a weekly of daily use for 6+ hours a day some days. My daughter did get a small blister on the side of her foot from where the shoe was rubbing, but I honestly believe that is was just how the shoe fit with her foot, and is not really a negative aspect of the shoe itself. I like that they tightened in the back for a snug secure fit, and I did not have a single complaint from my 3yr old during her use of them.	2015-08-10

US	14654946	R32FCVUUG9UICL	B000F3YMXS	74464316	Baggallini Messenger Bagg BS Convertible Cross-Body Bag	Shoes	3	4	4	N	Y	A very nice bag concept but could use a few improvements.	I think this is a great bag in general .  The one I received does not have the mesh shown in the picture for the middle pocket but that one is an older model and the newer model that i received had a solid lining. This bag does not provide any secure type locking system or rfid pockets so maybe not ideal for travel.  Easily fits more than you can imagine including a tablet but there is no padding ( might make it heavier).  If you overload, although the wide strap helps, you might want to buy those wrap cushions designed for backpacks.  Front strap pocket ok but too small for a phone or oversized sunglasses.  Maybe could be used for a credit card wallet.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />-Multi pockets<br />-lightweight<br />-water resistance<br />-attractive<br />-wide adjustable strap<br />-good size without being too small or large<br />-water bottle pocket ( although very tight squeeze for 16 oz bottle)<br />-side pocket for sunglasses<br /><br />What could be improved:<br />-needs to have rfid pockets and maybe some toggle closure for more security.<br />-Zippers don't always glide easily so not sure about longevity<br />-Lining in middle pocket is taller than zipper so gets caught every time ( maybe I got a defective one)<br />- have at least one side zip pocket  instead of all top entry ( slings twist around so you can easily access and most have a side entry pocket which makes it easy to leave the bag on your body while you access a pocket)<br />-would be nice if large pocket had a divider for more organization.<br />-Needs some updating for a quick access phone pocket that also fits larger phones (like the hidden quick grab ones that most of the travelon bags have)<br />-Wish strap could be used in either direction<br /><br />I will be sending mine back because of the lining/zipper problem.  I may try another or look for one that is close to this with more of the wish list features I listed above.	2015-08-10

It took me a few days to get adjusted to the arch support but you just wear them as long as you can and eventually they feel fine.

Although these sandals are fairly cute, the strap is a problem for 3 reasons.<br />1) I have a higher instep and these sandals don’t stretch enough to accommodate.<br />2) I really dislike Velcro, and it is completely unnecessary for these sandals.<br />3) Straps that come this high up one’s foot look juvenile and shorten the look of the leg.<br /><br />I made some adjustments to improve the fit.  However, I wish Keen would improve the design by moving the strap lower on the foot (to hit in the same spot as the Venice sandals) and remove the Velcro.<br /><br />My revamp:  I used a seam ripper to remove the grosgrain ribbon and the attached Velcro.  This revealed a strip of microfiber fabric that had been sewn to the ankle strap, which had reduced the stretchiness of the strap.  As a precaution, I sewed the fabric to the strap at the base, and then I trimmed it.  Sewing down the fabric is probably unnecessary as it doesn’t seem to fray, but I wanted to be safe.<br /><br />If the strap still bothers me, I will cut it off entirely.  The sandals stay on well enough without it.	2015-08-10

I have bought a new pair every year since. I have tried many newer models of Crocs slippers since, and was always disappointed. This design is perfect. The swivelling strap keeps them on, and having just 2 straps is not causing blisters even if I go for a 10Km hike. New models come with 3 straps, or not swivelling 2nd strap, flatter, less arch supporting soles, heels etc, all inferior to this old model. The only problem is that it is not available in stores anymore in Canada.	2015-08-10

These sandals would be superb ... if only the toe straps were adjustable. The advertising copy says they are, and the photos/sandals look they are, but in fact the toe straps are stitched in place with no adjustability whatsoever. Thus the front of the foot slips around and there is a tripping hazard. Too bad, because otherwise these are super comfortable; the ankle strap can be adjusted to exactly where you need it.	2015-08-10

I've only had a chance to wear them once in the rain, however my feet were dry as this was the sole purpose of the purchase.<br /><br />The only downside is that these shoes fit narrower than the average. I originally bought a regular width and they were very tight around the inside and outside of the toes. I returned them right away as I wasn't very confident that the leather could stretch enough with time for the pair to be comfortable. I bought the 2E width in its' place and they're comfortable for the casual style of the shoe. Something to think about if you're within outside borderline average width.<br /><br />This pair might be able to be worn all day depending on the person, if you're on your feet all day it may not be enough. More so this is a pair that gets you to and from wherever you're going without getting your feet wet nor having to spend twice the amount of money for similar style and quality- while also not having to look like the Gordon's Fisherman from the commercials.<br /><br />Overall, a good pair for the money spent.	2015-08-10

Wonderful shoe, comfortable, and even in my case the fit was not perfect but you can get used using a thick sock for example. After three months of almost two or three use per week, i hit a rock with the pedal (Time MX8) and get a broken sole just under the cleat mount. I don't know if this was fatigue material of the sole or due to the impact with the rock.  Usually i never return a pair of shoes but in this case i don't know how to make it. Teva local dealer is unable to give answer (i'm overseas) and this product doesn't even appear in Teva website catalog. Very frustrating.

I'm not sure what's going on with these boots. I ordered a pair a couple weeks ago and the first day I wore them I noticed a wet spot on the left boot just in front of the laces on the inside of the boot. I figured I dripped on them after washing my hands. The spot didn't go away though, in fact it got larger as the day went on. That exact little spot... I figured I'd make sure it dried up over night and I'd have a look the next day. Same thing happened. I thought it was pretty weird. Maybe there's a moisture barrier in there or something that wasn't stitched properly, maybe that little spot wasn't treated properly during the production, who knows? I set up an exchange and got a new pair which arrived today. THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED. SAME LEFT BOOT! I've never experienced this before but it's just plain weird. This time I snagged a picture to show what was going on here. I'm guessing there is a whole boat load of these shoes produced in the same place that have the same defect. It's a shame but I guess I wasn't meant to have these boots. The sad thing is now I have two wasted trips to the UPS store. After paying over 100 bucks for the boots and more than 2 weeks later I don't have a pair that's satisfactory for keeping and I've wasted gas going back to the UPS shop to send them back. Quite dissatisfied.	2015-08-10

If there is a way to exchange them at this point I would like to.  Was not able to find any information on how to exchange.	2015-08-10

UPDATE: Losing stars :( I've had these shoes for less than a month.

I'd never heard of this brand of bag before I bought this, and usually I go for a leather-type handbag. This was somewhat of a departure from that preference, but having read some really great reviews on how lightweight these bags are, and how well they hold up, I thought I'd give it a shot. So far it has exceeded my expectations, and the reviewers are right. It is very lightweight and sturdy. I really like the feel of the fabric, and love all the pockets - fantastic way to organized everything! I think the thing I appreciate the most is the lovely bright yellow interior that makes finding things that go hiding in the deepest recesses of your bag a snap. The strap is ultra-adjustable, so I can have it longer for cross-body style, or shorter for just over-the-shoulder or hand carry. The only very small complaint is that the slider buckle on the strap is slippery and doesn't hold its position well for the length selected. I can probably figure out a work-around for that problem pretty easily, though. I just really like this bag!	2015-08-10

Bought these on sale from a Nike factory outlet.  They felt great in the store so I decided to pick them up.  After having played on them for a few weeks I began developing shin splints and my feet really hurt sometimes after playing.  I've had splints before so I won't say that I got them only from this shoe, could just be coincidental timing. I certainly know that the sore feet specifically in the ball/toe area are from these shoes though as when i switch back to my other shoes I don't get the same pains.<br /><br />I have flat, narrow feet so perhaps it is just for my specific foot type, but I would say if you fall into that category as well, you should probably steer clear of this shoe.  I'm already looking into buying another pair of sneakers and just eating the $50 I paid for these.	2015-08-10

It took a good two months or so, plus gel inserts, until I could finally get off of an 8-10 hour shift and not be in pain. Now that I've been in them for a few months and they are broken in, I have no problems with them. My best advice would certainly be to ease yourself into them. The toe area is a bit narrow, but they are durable and I have not had any issues working in an environment where floors are frequently wet.	2015-08-10

Since its August, and I live in the South I have not had a chance to wear these all day.<br />However, I tried them on and they  looked really cute and comfortable. I usually wear a 6 or 6.5, got a 7 based on the other reviews, they wear a bit loose but I'll probably be wearing them with tights.<br />I was relieved to find there was plenty of room for my muscular calves. I had read prior reviews saying the calf on these  was 15 inches or 14 inches.<br />Based on that I measured  the biggest part of my calves and got 15 inch measurement and was a bit worried they wouldnt fit. However, I had room to spare when I zipped them up.	2015-08-10

I was replacing a pair of the exact same shoes that I wear comfortably to walk on my breaks and lunch time at work which had worn out. This new pair (exactly the same) gaps at the side with each step, gave me blisters on my ankles and I've now started wearing socks with them so no more blisters but after about 10 minutes the right shoe feels like i'm stepping on a lead pipe - there is definitely something defective about this pair of shoes because the previous pair were wonderful! So I would endorse the style but I just got a reject pair.	2015-08-10

I have tried many work shoes that have never lasted more than a year before they are ready to throw out. But the Timberland Pro Mudsill shoes are the best I personally have owned and worn. These are worn 5-6 days a week, 8 to 10 hours a day in a machine shop environment where there is the constant threat of spilled oil or a dropped piece of steel and they do quite well.<br /><br />I am now on my second pair of Timberland Pros. The first pair are over 2 years old (purchased May of 2013) and have developed noticeable wearing mainly in the heel and toe areas. Wear on the inside is better than expected. Also, I have not yet had to replace the shoe strings. Though I am now on my second pair, the first pair are by no means ready to throw away. They are still usable for yard work. The quality of construction is evident in the workmanship of the product.<br /><br />I wear a size 10.5 wide. They fit as expected and are quite comfortable once broken in. Wearing these shoes all day means sweaty feet so I use the bamboo charcoal packets to absorb the odor and prevent bacteria from forming. I am very happy with the product and will of course purchase these again.	2015-08-10

He has high arches, and apparently a wider foot, so many of the cleats made by other brands don't fit him right.  We found these about 18 months ago, and he was very happy with the fit, and the performance of the K Leather.  This year he needed a bigger size, and when he couldn't find something comfortable in the other brands, we went back to Diadora and the Evloluzione.  However I had to look all over to find some place that had the size we needed as Diadora is no longer making this model and many sizes are now sold out.  I went ahead and purchased the next size up as well to avoid needing to go thru this search again next year.	2015-08-10

A little wide but not &#34;WIDE&#34;. It makes standard sizes too tight and wide sizes too loose. I have started wearing orthotic inserts to help with Plantar Fasciitis and it makes standard shoes way too tight. I use the inserts and it made these boots fit just right (10 1/2 wide).<br />These boots are some of the best I have purchased in a long time. very comfortable from the first day and getting better. They stay tied and came with premium woven laces. Nice grip on the bottom, great for working on a ladder.<br />If I had one thing I would change it would be the tongue. I would make it about 1/2&#34; taller as it just covers the top lace without using the gusset's. I never use the gussets so it is not a problem for me but may for someone who uses the gussets.

Now that I've started a new teaching job	I have purchased Aerosoles in the past and were very happy.  Now that I've started a new teaching job, I decided to purchase a couple more pairs to be stylish and comfortable.  The first time I wore them, I found them to slip off the back of my feet a little, but they were so cute I decided I could deal with that.  Then after a while, they started hurting my feet on each side just below my toes.  I thought maybe I just needed to break them in a bit.  No such luck!  I tried to wear them a second time and I couldn't even keep them on my feet for 15 minutes.  They were slipping off AND hurting my feet really bad.  Sad part is I only wore them ONCE, I'm an Amazon employee, and the site says I was supposed to return them by July 18th, 2015!!! Now I'm stuck with this shoe and the silver and white loafer!!:-(  Even though I'm an Amazon employee... I'm stuck with shoes I can't wear, and I'm out of $100 BUCKS!!!  Not good!	2015-08-10

However, the shoes fit wonderfully well on my right foot. Yet, on my left foot the pinky toe is somehow being hurt. It's like a pinching or gathering of a seam or something. I've tried wiggling my toes as well as manually manipulating each digit especially the pinking toe. It still hurts. I read the sizing reviews before I ordered and therefore ordered the next size up, from where I should have. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I love these shoes, love the color, and am afraid that the next size up will be too big. But, I don't want to own a product that I KNOW caused me discomfort right away. Going to try putting a bandaid on the spot (on my toe) to see how that works, before returning them.	2015-08-10

Personally my wallet has none of those flaws. What I do like about it though is that it has a really simple and cute design and it has plenty of room.

It was a warm day, and I walked a bit over a mile in them, but that is why I always buy Reefs. In my past experiences, they have been great summer shoes for me.

I hate shopping for shoes in stores, and this was my first purchase of Johnston & Murphy shoes on-line. (I bought these in August 2014.)<br /><br />Since I had purchased Johnston & Murphy shoes before, and know my size, I took a gamble with Amazon. I bought the tan version of this shoe.  These shoes look great and fit me perfectly - there were no problems at all, straight out of the box and took no time to &#34;break in&#34;.  I wear them a couple of times a week with dress clothes for work.  When they are &#34;off duty&#34;, I use cedar wood shoe trees to help them keep their shape and fit.  I've still got some older Johnston & Murphy loafers (black)  that are at least 10 years old, and that have been re-soled and re-heeled probably half a dozen times. The uppers still look good, so  I'm expecting the same with these shoes.  Frankly, I do not see any decrease in the quality of the leather or construction.	2015-08-10

Unfortunately, this particular style did not work very well for me in a smaller size (they felt fine, but my toes came too close to the front edge to &#34;look&#34; good), so I returned the shoes.  BTW, I tried this style in both the 5-5.5 and the 5.5-6 (both of which are a 36 EU -- can't quite figure that one out) and there did not seem to be any appreciable difference in the fit. I may try a 37, if and when I can find a decent sale on that size.  UPDATE:  I have now ordered these shoes in a size 37 and they are WAY larger then the size 36.  Not only are they much longer, but they are so much wider that the two top portions (that lace together) almost overlap. I really like these and am trying to determine if my feet would swell enough in the summer (or maybe I could wear an insole or something) to take up the slack and make these shoes (which I got at a fantastic price right before Thanksgiving) work for me. I have a few weeks to ponder this, but I have a feeling they may be going back :-(	2015-08-10

After having worn this style for several years, the shoes are usually snug at first and after a day of wearing them, your feet will provide enough give so they are comfortable for all day wear.

I use these boots as warm summer wading boots to fly fish in very rocky rivers with moderate to strong current.

We gather cattle in rough terrain.  This involves lots of walking.  This boot supports my foot well.  However, I can no longer wear the boot.  I wear 6.5 D in Womens.  NO ONE makes this size in a boot.  I have a high arch, and need a lot of room for my toes.  Years of wearing boots that aren't quite wide enough (no, getting a 7 instead doesn't work.  No, a 6.5 CD is not the same as a 6.5D) has given me metatarsalgia.  Men's boots would have to come in size 4.5 and they don't.  Boys' boots do not have room in them for a high arch, and you can't get this size anyway.  If these boots came in a size 6.5D, I would never buy a different boot ever.  As it is, I am still looking.	2015-08-10

Not so! They fit perfectly as expected and stayed on during all the water activities. They provided the comfort and protection I needed while in the water! However, after day 4 of using them, the top part of the shoes started to develop a small rip from putting them on and off! I was so disappointed that Speedo did not take the time to ensure that the quality of their product was sewn correctly. Despite the small rip, I was still able to continue using them for the remainder of the trip. I wish I could reuse this Watershoes again, but sadly, I don't think I would purchase it again!	2015-08-10

I wanted one big enough to hold my planner (Erin Condren planner), have an outside pocket for phone and keys, have an inside zipper pocket for personal items, have only one strap, be durable and cute. This one has it all. I didn't want to carry around a gigantic purse just to get all of my things in it. I am excited to try the back pack feature. (there is a snap loop on the back for the strap, making it into a back pack). I have not owned a Baggallini bag before and I feel like they are a bit pricey but I have heard they hold up well so maybe that will offset the sticker shock. Also, the bag does not have any unpleasant odor as some new bags do. I am also please that the stitching seems to be well done and the hardware seems durable. The only thing that would make it better would be more organization inside the bag.	2015-08-10

I had tried Orthoheel before, but the thong cut into my big toe on three different pairs.  I had not tried Orthoheel in a couple of years and thought I would try them again since I needed new sandals.  This time there is no cutting issue.  The arch support is superior and there is far more cushion.  I am so happy to finally be in a pair.  The thong is a little loose on the top of my foot, but since there is no cutting issue, I can live with that.	2015-08-10

I really wanted to like these shoes but got a full size up from what I wear and they were still very tight. The lock laces did not allow me to let much out, so with the laces all the way released, it was still a tight fit. They did stay in place, no heel slippage. Had really good foot support, great color.<br />A bit heavier than the  N1.<br />Right out the box they were hard to get on, even ordering a size up. There was a lot of pressure on the top of my foot and my toes. I would have preferred a bit of wiggle room. Walked in them on day one with no socks...had to put socks on after about two hours as they started to rub the top of my foot. The shoes feel heavy compare to the N1, but provided better impact cushioning so can't fault that.<br />With thin socks they felt better, but still really tight.<br />The next day I ran three miles in them. They were okay. They had great traction, a big improvement over the N1. They gripped the road without suctioning my foot to the ground and slowing me down. They handled off road well, but were unbalanced in the grass and made it hard to feel the ground so had to be really careful how I put my foot down... they did great on gravel and dirt, but handled the road best.<br />The day after that I could not wear them without socks.<br />The heel rest is really stiff, but it did not bother my foot and I tend to be very sensitive to this, so that surprised me.<br />Wore them on short runs for a week and they were okay, but still not really comfortable to wear.<br />After a week I took them on a 12 mile run and they really rubbed my toes (my second toe is longer than my big toe so it took most of the wear and actually started to hurt forcing me to walk the next mile and a half and finally give up.<br />I keep hoping they will loosen up like the N1 s did, but it took them six months to start to feel more comfortable and I haven't got that much time to break these in before the next long race, so am a bit disappointed on the fit. I really feel like I needed to go up two sizes.<br />For short runs I think these shoes will do, but for long runs, they put too much pressure on my toes and feel cramped in the toe box.<br />So, the negatives... tight fit, puts pressure on toes and upper foot without much space to release it, heel box is a bit too stiff with a bit too much padding if you are used to a more minimalist shoe.<br />Positives - has great traction and turn over, making it easy to take long strides, protects feet from pounding, great color and design, easy to pull on and fits snugly, has a good amount of upper ventilation and relatively lightweight compared to other model shoes.	2015-08-10

When I tried them on they were somewhat small so I started the refund process to return the shoes which was pretty easy. Since these dont come in half sizes I ordered a size 8. Got them in 2 days with prime. I tried these on and they fit perfectly so I would say these shoes run 1 size too small. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I had to return the first pair and the size 8 that fits has one ankle strap that is somewhat shorter than the other. You cant really tell when I am wearing the shoes so I can overlook that but its kinda weird to buckle one ankle strap in the first hole and the other in the third. Overall I like the shoes and i think it was a good buy.	2015-08-10

I was looking for a set of good winter boots, since I walk everywhere, and I live in chilly New England. I actually wear these as all purpose boots, because they are so pretty, and go with almost everything! They kept my feet warm and dry, when it was 15 below zero, with snow up to my waist. Withstood hours of snow shoveling, walking in cold and wet weather. As other have said, the caveat is the Velcro closure above the zippers on the inside of the boot. They're weak, and fiddly, and don't do much. It does make the top of the boot on the inside of the leg a bit floppy, as the leather gives way where the Velcro cuts in. Although I don't have skinny calves, by any stretch of the imagination, they were still a bit loose at the top, closed all of the way. It did help, however, when wearing layers of leggings or pants, on the really cold days, because there was always room to tuck them into the top of the boots, without having to worry about them closing. They fit really nice, too. I have big feet (10-11 in women, depending), and they're also a bit wide. These fit perfectly, right out the box. I was impressed! All in all, these are fabulous, and I would recommend them.	2015-08-10

I love the sock-like grip of the shoe, the air max heel, and unique design of the shoes.<br /><br />The biggest benefit I've seen is when wearing these to theme parks like Disneyland.  I have an annual pass and have tried several different shoes, but the fingertraps have always left my feet feeling great after 8-10 hour days of walking around plus waiting in line.  When I know I'm in for a long day, I always pick these out from my collection of 10+ pairs of shoes.<br /><br />My second favorites are my flyknit free 4.0, which are great for short, 2-4 hour outings but not so much for longer days.  Once these fingertraps are worn out, I might be trying the flyknit air max to get the best of both worlds.  That price tag is quite steep though and would likely steer me elsewhere!<br /><br />I don't use these for working out since I mostly lift (I use Adidas Adipowers), but for sports activities minus basketball, these would be my go-to.  The grip is amazing for simply walking around and I love hearing the sticky grip sound when walking around on pavement.<br /><br />I also have Skechers walking shoes with memory foam inside, but those actually left my feet in pain after ~4 hours. Those are collecting dust and will be donated to charity.	2015-08-10

Wore my first pair for almost two years, 3 shifts of 12 hours per week, walking most of the shift.

I've had these shoes in black and gold, with the &#34;rubber&#34; insoles. After my puppy chewed the black pair, I purchased another. I have always considered these shoes a fantastic choice....comfortable, stylish and a nice height (I am not a fan of flats). In these, I feel as if I'm going to slide out of them, at any moment. I did not realize the difference, when I purchased them. I am very comfortable, walking in all types of shoes, including 4-5&#34; high-heels. These do not work for me.	2015-08-10

They would be super comfortable if only the outer lip of the shoe (at the base of the pinkie toe)  didn't dig into  my foot.  I'm on my feet all day long at work for 10 hours straight.  Everyday I keep thinking these will break-in and everyday I come home after wearing these only the side of my foot hurts where the lip digs into the bone.  I do have wide feet but that's why I always order my shoes wide.  Guess these shoes aren't wide enough.	2015-08-10

Break in kind of sucked and had to clip off a sharp spot on some stitching inside but otherwise good boots. If you do a lot of walking on grip tape (stairs or ladders) the sole  will probably wear out within a year or so. Thats about what mine lasted.

While comparing different styles, I noticed other reviewers have posted that New Balance's sizing seems to have gotten smaller.

I ordered a different style a half-size larger and will see how that works out.	2015-08-10

I tried them on in a store and they *looked* snug around the ankle and calf, which I loved.  Then, I didn't buy them and Born stopped making them.  I searched high and low online to find these boots and sent messages trying to find out what the size was that would best fit me.  I received a half-assed response that did not answer my question and I went ahead and bought a pair much larger than I thought would fit, because It's better to end up with boots too big than too small.  Well, if I wear winter socks, my foot fits in the footbed just great.  Normally I wear a 8.5/9 womens US size, or 39.5 EUR size.  I bought these in a 41.5 and there's no way I could have fit smaller than a 40.5 for these.  I'm okay with how loose they are, but I'm really bummed that they don't hugh my ankle and calf tightly like the size I tried on in the store.  I wear them a lot, but I would wear them more if they fit better.  Zero arch support (does that exist in a heeled shoe anyway?  However, they ARE Born brand shoes, which are one of the only brands of shoes that fit my feet comfortably.  These are the first heeled boots I've bought in a decade, and they do look great.  Too bad they've stopped making them.	2015-08-10

And not just first time wear blisters....horrible ones that bled through my socks and still cause me to wear big thick band aids on my heels.....almost one month later after almost full time use.<br />I honestly don't know if it's going to get better at this point, it may be the make of the sneaker. My left heel is still being rubbed raw. I have had no name brand sneakers that were way more comfortable.<br />Not sure what else to say except that I am very disappointed in them being so uncomfortable.	2015-08-10

I have been wearing various styles of Vibram Five Fingers shoes for about six years now and very nearly exclusively for the last four of those. I've had 11 different pairs in seven different styles with the last two styles being the Alitza and the Alitza loop. The Alitza line is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite. They are as attractive as a pair of Five Fingers could possibly be, slim in appearance and even so well styled as to appear feminine. They are incredibly lightweight and flexible and are easier to get on your foot than the more rigid and enclosed models. If someone wished to see if Vibram Five Fingers were a good option for them for casual wear, I can't think of any other current style that would have a greater chance of pleasing than this.	2015-08-10

So far, ! have worn them shopping for about three hours, and that is about the limit that I would wear them for walking.  I usually wear a size 9, so I ordered that size.  I found that these shoes run somewhat larger than expected--I really needed an 8.5, but they were only available in whole sizes.  I think that a size 8 would be too small for me.	2015-08-10

I happily wore a different line of Oxford Redwing shoes for years when I worked as a mechanic. I was hoping to have a similar experience with this pair as I transitioned to a different line of work. Unfortunately, I could not get used to the difference in the way the left and right shoe fit. The left sat flat against the ground, but the toe of the right shoe sat off the ground when standing on my heel. This resulted in a steeper arch on the right shoe than the left. While I could probably have eventually broken them in to wear evenly, I opted not to take that chance with shoes that were in the $300 range and ended up returning them.	2015-08-10

I thought this would be a great shoe for that not only because of its rubber construction (which would prevent the absorption of water) but also because of the simple design and neutral color. I figured this was one shoe that I could continue to use after I got home with no issues. Not only is this flip flop true to size (I generally wear a 7.5 or 8 depending on the shoe and the size 8 fit great) but it is also very comfortable. And it's been a very versatile shoe just like I anticipated it being. I wore this shoe in the hospital shower (my original plan), to walk around my hospital room and I continued to wear it once I got home. They've even been my go to flip flop for beach/pool time. And it's now been over a year since I purchased these and they look no worse for wear. They have proven to be incredibly durable and resilient! All in all, this has got to be the best flip flop that I've ever purchased. No regrets here.	2015-08-10

I actually returned these because of the sole material but they are a very nice shoe otherwise.  I've never owned a pair of crocs before so maybe this is a &#34;thing&#34; with their shoes but the cushioning for your feet in these shoes is a rubber/plastic sole with hundreds of little nubs sticking up throughout the sole.  You can barely see them in the photos of the shoes.  I have no idea what this is for, do you really need traction on the sole of your shoe?  All it did for me was make the shoe incredibly uncomfortable.  The sole would maybe work on other shoes but these are just canvas shoes you're going to wear with no socks when you want total comfort, and the soles of these shoes did not provide that for me.  I understand the use of rubber as I have other similar shoes that have similar soles (without the nubs) and they work well to not trap sweat, help when your feet are wet, etc. but the roughness of the crocs soles are something that's just not needed whatsoever on a shoe like this.  If they would fix this issue I think the shoe would be a great product.	2015-08-10

I bought this purse over a year ago and I've carried it every day since. I LOVE this purse. I was told that it's not genuine leather but it is a REALLY good substitute. Yes, the carry pocket is a BIT small, but I was carrying a sig sauer p938 PLUS 2 spare mags in the pocket and it all fit fine. Also, the pocket is padded and soft so the gun is protected. In addition to that pocket there's tons of space to carry anything you'd need inside the 2 main compartments. I carry a full water bottle, a huge wallet, cell phone, keys, sunglasses, and a bunch of other stuff IN JUST THE FRONT HALF of the purse, and I'd still have room for more stuff if I needed it. This purse is great. If you're the type of person that carries everything you could ever need in your purse, every single day, then this is the purse for you...	2015-08-10

These partially fit the bill as they seemed to be wide enough and comfortable for the few minutes I had them on, until I noticed the triangular thingy on the side was rubbing my foot.  Of course, not being able to fully close the strap across the top of my ankle was a drawback as well and the shoes were returned.	2015-08-10

These boots are adorable and the material pretty good as well--however they run REALLY, really small. I wear a size 8 shoe normally so I ordered a size 9 boot. They fit pretty snugly and comfortably without any liners...the only problem being that I wear these type of boots in the winter in the snow, so I usually want a liner. So if you want to have a bit of room or use liners in these boots, I would actually order two sizes up from your usual shoe size. If you want them snug and won't be wearing anything besides socks, one size is good.	2015-08-10

If you are even slightly on the fence about these shoes take the plunge they are completely worth it. I bought these shoes because I was looking for some that were cute yet casual to wear on my vacation to Las Vegas. These are adorable on and the bling gave them just enough for me to be able to dress them up just as much as I wanted to dress them down. I had no problems with any stones coming out and believe me I put these shoes to work. The thing I was not expecting was how comfortable they were. If you have ever been to Vegas before then you know how difficult it is just walking through the hotels, but nothing compared to the strip. I actually walked the strip in these shoes quite a bit during my 6 day trip and wore them in the airport there and back home. Surprisly almost no foot pain! Of course they aren't going to be like walking on clouds but for flat sandals that are actually cute they did a phenomenal job! I'm so glad that I found these shoes now I can strut my stuff in cute shoes and without having to bandage my feet without recognition afterward!	2015-08-10

I recently bought a pair of these glasses for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them! The tinting is super dark which makes it perfect for blocking out the sun! They took approximately 2-4 days to be delivered and the customer service with this company is outstanding. The Fly Pelican made sure that I was completely satisfied with the glasses and if I wasn't then they offered me a refund. The only bad side about the glasses is the sizing.. they run a bit small/ tight for some adults. But besides from that I will definitely recommend these glasses and other products from this company to my family and friends. Definitely worth 5 stars!!!	2015-08-10

I wanted to give 3.5 but it wasn't an option so I gave a four because a 3 was too low. Anyhow, they are good sandals. I can't wear them all day though but for several hours they are good and they look nice. I work in a business casual office and they are ok for casual Friday's but not regular office days. They get hot after awhile and the straps are uncomfortable by the end of the day. They are cushioned enough to not cause my plantar fasciitis to flare though.

I was so hesitant to buy this wallet after reading reviews about the zipper breaking (reviews read on Fossil's website, not Amazon's), that I called Amazon and nearly cancelled the order.  Amazon's customer service is so great that the representative and I decided together that I would keep the order intact, try the wallet when it arrived, and if the zipper seemed at all flimsy, cheap, breakable, or if I had any doubts, I could return the wallet right away.  She expedited my order at no charge, and set up a follow up call to see how the wallet worked.  Well, I am glad I took the chance.  This is a beautiful wallet and I have not had any zipper problems at all.  It fits everything as advertised.  It has plenty of room.  I've had the wallet for about 3 weeks now, so fingers crossed.  But so far, I could not be happier.  It is the best wallet I have ever had.  Should things go wrong, I will update this review.	2015-08-10

I purchased these over the Danskos that were available because of multiple mysterious reviews that claim that Sanitas are equivalent to the &#34;classic&#34; Danskos that older nurses loved in the glory days. Within 20 days of arrival, walking maybe 6-7 thousand steps per day, these shoes have completely broken down- the right shoe sole has split down the middle; the left shoe's vamp has become detached from the sole at the toe. I compared them to my girlfriend's Danskos which she's had for four years (and are actually the same bordeaux color, just to highlight how hilarious the difference is), and hers look like they're in perfect working condition next to my 20-day old Sanitas. Pass over these shoes and get something that lasts longer for your hundred bucks.	2015-08-10

However, the fit is not great as I bought my usual size 8.5 wide but these were a bit too long in terms of length and not very wide (I have a bunion and wide in most brands like Trotters and Rose petals all fit me in Wide). Not sure if a size 8 W would fit better. If you have long toes and do not like these to show up, give these shoes a miss as the front portion of the shoe is short. Overall, I would return the shoe if not for the cost of the international return freight.	2015-08-10

Mine did arrive bent,  didn't sit good after spending 55 bucks with shipping for them. But I was able to straighten them enough so as not to show. All in all, I think the correct  price for this quality of shades should probably be $15-$25. By the way, they do not say 'Fight Club' on them, anywhere.	2015-08-10

I can not explain the excitement of one four year old girl this morning when she got her new Rain Boots! ( as she calls them) I was super excited when I received the SIYA girls rubber boots, they are brightly colored, have a nice, soft insulated inside, and are high enough to week the little ones feet nice and dry! They also have a slip proof bottom, so it makes it safe for her to wear inside. The SIYA rubber boots are super durable, and ever after playing in the water the beautiful designs stayed in place! She had no problem wearing them and they didn't slip up and down on her feet. They fit her just right, she normally wears a size 12, but I ordered a 13 and she has plenty of growing room in them. She finds them comfortable enough to wear inside the house. I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The price however does not affect my opinion of the product.	2015-08-10

However the Chinese built motorcycle boots are size 12D These snake boots are nicely built. Nice leather lining inside the stout canvas like upper.

While the construction of the shoe is great and the foam feels very nice the shoe is just not designed for a high-volume foot.

My first half marathon was in December 2013; since then, I have run four more, and am currently training for my first marathon this upcoming December. If there is anything I have learned through my experiences training for these races, it is how incredibly important it is to have a good shoe designed for your particular stride. I started my training in neutral shoes, and had terrible shin splints and femoropatellar pain. I went to a reputable running shop and had them analyze my gait; they determined that I am a moderate overpronator and recommended I use stability shoes. I started out with the Saucony Omni, which helped my problems a lot and allowed me to comfortably run my first half marathon. After I had worn these shoes out, I moved on to the Brooks Adrenaline GTS; I like those shoes a lot and currently have two pairs. However, I decided that since the intensity of my training is about to go up significantly, I don't want to rely too much on a single brand/model of shoe. Studies have shown that rotating between different models of shoe during training reduces a runner's risk of injury by 39% (Google &#34;rotating running shoes&#34; and see the first Runner's World article that pops up).<br /><br />So, I set out to research the different types of stability shoes that are available. Eventually, I settled on the Asics Kayano 21 based on positive customer reviews and the well-known brand name. I normally wear a 7-7.5 in regular shoes, but I wear an 8 in my Brooks Adrenalines, so I chose the size 8 for my Asics Kayanos. Compared to the Brooks, the Asics are a little bit longer in the toe. My first impression when trying them on is that they are also a lot cushier than my Brooks, while still providing good arch support. Although they were long in the toe area, they weren't really very wide; my toes felt a little squished during the initial try-on, but not so much so that it ended up being a problem when I actually ran withthem.<br /><br />So far I have only run once in these shoes, a 6.2 mile break-in run. It felt even better than I hoped for! My most recent pair of Brooks required several runs to break them in; though they feel great now, those first few runs left me with pretty painful feet, even after just a couple miles. In contrast, the Asics remained comfortable through nearly the whole 6.2 miles; my feet only started to feel &#34;tired&#34; for the last couple of miles, and I have had no issues so far with post-run pain.<br /><br />I realize that a single run probably is not the best basis to write an entire review, so I will come back in a few weeks and update this post when I've had some more time to train in these babies. But my overall first impression is very positive. I love these shoes; I was nervous about branching out from a model of shoe that I know and love, but in the case of the Asics Kayano I think it was a very good decision. Looking forward to many happy miles with them!	2015-08-10

Sandals in particular, get trickier as your feet tend to flop around due to instability of them.<br />Here is where Reefs really shine. I got them last week and wore them all weekend long. They provided a lot of support and minimized all the flopping. That to me is priceless in and of itself, however, the price on Amazon should make this a no-brainer for folks who want a stylish, comfortable and supportive sandal.	2015-08-10

It's hard to open the bag and the hand strap gets in the way of you opening it completely to pull things out. This doesn't work for me when at the cash register.

It's a different kind of plastic from what Wayfarers and other glasses use. The idea that heavy plastic = quality is ridiculous. Plastic is cheap. The Frogskins fit and look great, especially the lenses. And they're light, which is nice for active, sporty outings, or just when you want something lighter on your face.	2015-08-10

Too bad they are slanted so much in the toe area. I am one whose second toe is longer than the first (big toe) and these shoes are uncomfortable because while all my other little piggies are fine in the shoes, my second toe on my right foot (presumably the larger of the two) bumps against the front of the shoe. I thought this would be fixed by ordering a 1/2 size bigger... Low and behold, the shoes are too big AND I have the same problem! It's a little less bothersome, but I can't see myself walking in these without constantly noticing that this is happening. Even if I didn't notice in the beginning, this would be cause for a sore toe after a while, I'm sure of it. Bummer.	2015-08-10

FYI- Pix show my old beat up sz 9 Ugg Coquette along-side brand new sz 10 Eurow Sheepskin Scuff  :b  For reference, pix show NEW &#34;Sand&#34; Womens sz 10 Eurows next to 2 yrs. old beat-up sz 9 Ugg Coquette.  I was concerned w/ reviews stating the soles were stiff, boardlike, heavy, & clunky... Upon receipt, no more-so than Uggs nor any other Sheepskin slipper  😀  They bend where the foot bends (upper/forefoot, just in front of toes).  Not much flex otherwise- These are meant to protect the foot, & provide unmatched shock absorption with each step. Tons of fluffy sheepskin inside, & they custom conform to each owners foot!  btw- These are plenty sturdy for wearing outdoors, walking down the driveway to get the mail, take out the garbage, walk around the yard, even to run errands in car- Will accommodate a wide foot, & the toe-box is wide, tall, & deep, allowing toes to slide fully down into slippers (without being squished).  Real leather uppers w/ shearling (wool) lining & insole, nice & fluffy / dense / cushy Construction is solid/sturdy, & well-designed (except for size- Too short).    These run wide, but WAY short in length. I wear 9's in Uggs Coquette Slippers, (size 8 Uggs fit me too); Womens 10's in Frye boots & other high quality footwear; Yet, these Eurow Women's 10's were too short- (I would need an 11 in these). Since they don't come in 11's, I gave these sz 10's to my daughter, for her Unversity dorm room. (She wears sz 8 Uggs, sz 9 Frye boots & all other shoes). She LOVES them!  💖. (Actually, she prefers Eurow's plush comfort over her Uggs!).  Note: 2 decades' experience has taught us to fully expect the insole wool (footbed only) to rub / wear nearly completely off, nearly immediately. Werp are in a frigid winter climate, & this happens to all Sheepskin slippers over the 1st few weeks of wear.  Replacement insoles (which we buy separately here on Amazon for $6-$10/pair) must be inserted when new; & thereafter replaced annually.  Its a lot easier to do so with these $35-$40  beauties, vs. Uggs overpriced $120 model!  In summary- Comfy, plush, real leather upper & genuine sheepskin lining, with sturdy, lightweight outsoles (neither heavy nor overly stiff).  Clunky?  Yes 👌  Eurows rate among the very best / top quality &#34;Sheepskin&#34; type slippers.  Sand Color is beautiful / pale neutral. In summary, if you are accustomed to Uggs, wear size 9 or less, & want that comfort & quality at 1/3 the price, this is your slipper!  (Just be sure to size UP!).   Need a larger size, other TOP quality slippers?  Here's the scoop (4 brands): Eurow's, Dr. Sheepskins, Lamo's (make sure they're genuine Sheepskin version- Lamo sells &#34;synthetics&#34; too), or Brumby's!	2015-08-10

Towards the end of the shift, my feet were sweaty and I was squeaking in my shoes whenever I walked. My feet also hurt at the end of the day from the friction of sliding around in my own sweat. I won't chance a twelve hour shift wearing these shoes. I'll probably put them in my locker as spares.	2015-08-10

I'm still wearing the Hurricanes but Amazon had these at a great price so I purchased them. I wear  Hi-Tec boots for lawncare and they last longer than any other boots I've wore. The waterproofing is excellent, I hose them off before taking them off to remove dried on grass and they have never gotten wet on the inside. The Vibram soles are treaded nicely, hold up well and provide great traction on slippery grass slopes. I've tried everything from cheap boots to $160 Danners. None are as light, durable or last as long as Hi-Tecs. They are comfortable to wear all day, good support on the inside, constructed well, they stay together when some boots tend to come apart at the seam and sole. Very nice shoe strings too, long enough to double tie. Hi-Tec boots are very comparable to higher priced hiking boots, just as good if not better. I wear size 10 Nikes and size 10 Hi-Tecs fits the same.	2015-08-10

I had to return my first pair, because they were a little small, but the second pair fit perfectly!  I used them for a costume, and the spray paint stripe near the top stayed perfect through three days of me wearing them and occasionally rubbing them together.  I was a little worried because I have large thighs (size 10) but they zipped up and didn't give me any weird bulges.  I was still able to bend my knees to pick things up off of the floor.  They were a little painful to wear at first, but with a few bandages I was able to walk from my hotel room to the convention center, and around the center all day with minimal breaks for the entire convention.  I am very pleased with these.	2015-08-10

Lately in my family our choice is to buy sunglasses with no particular brand in mind, we mainly look for the best all around frame and lens combo. My husband's eyes are extremely sensitive to sunlight. I bought this sunglasses for him due to its wraparound style frames which are a must for blocking side light, and they do it very well. Due to my husband's work and also his passion for the outdoors there are days when he spends a lot of time outdoors, his new Mambo Polarized Sports Sunglasses are a comfortable fit that stay put, they block sunlight well, while they still let him see with clarity. This sunglasses are made of nice quality materials. They come nicely packaged and include a nice protective pouch for when they need to be put away.<br />I received this item at a promotional rate, this has in no way affected my opinion. This review is my opinion and has been written in my own words.	2015-08-10

They are so outrageously creative and zany and wacky and over the top.  I have five or six pairs now and I turn to them when a whimsical mood or upbeat feeling is capturing my day.  People always comment on Poetic License shoes because they are so different  --  but charmingly so.  They turn a hum-drum blah outfit into one that is the perfect backdrop or foil for the wit of the shoes.  I noticed that PL was offering several of its shoes for ludicrously low prices  --  but all of them featured a lot of orange.  I don't wear orange.  But I ordered three of the sale shoes because I knew that it didn't matter that I don't wear orange.  I just wear them with outfits that &#34;go with&#34; the shoes.  When the shoes are this funky, &#34;matching&#34; just doesn't matter.  These shoes just play the central focus of what one is wearing, and they are so much fun.  (And they're comfortable.)	2015-08-10

My 2 year old has his mamma's wide feet. These are wide enough for his big ole foot to fit in there. The straps help keep it snug at the ankle. We're toilet training so these shoes have been a god send. How you may ask. If you have ever toilet trained you know accidents are the norm and of course the shoes take a drowning. Washing and drying will destroy your shoes life expectancy. If little man comes home from school with his shoes in the accident bag, we just pop these bad boys in the dishwasher and the next morning they're good to go. He can put them on by himself (granted not always on the correct foot but hardly the shoes' fault there). I love the closed toe factor. Sandals are great but a lot of preschools will not allow open toed sandals and in the summer who wants to bother with socks and tennis shoes. These meet his school's safety requirements but allow him the cool airy affect that I want. He has now worn these all summer long. The velcro straps are still going strong. The only reason he won't wear these again next year is that they won't fit. The colours are still as true as when they arrived.	2015-08-10

These are comfortable right out of the box.  Super light and flexible with nice cushion.  The laces are on the short side, but that's perfect for me since I've always double knotted my other shoes to shorten the laces to prevent tripping on them.  Some shoes are stiff until I break them in, but these are great on the first run.  I have average width feet with narrow heels and moderate arch.  These give me plenty of support and cushion, but I'm only 5 feet and 90 pounds, so I don't have the average need for heavier duty shoes.  I run an average of 3-5 miles daily on paved bike/walking trail and packed sand (at the beach) in Newport Beach, CA.  These are my favorite running shoes so far.	2015-08-10

After having tried these on, no other golf shoes available felt as good. While the Eccos and Ashton shoes are made with superior materials to most shoes on the market (not just golf shoes; all shoes), the comfort of the Adidas boost beat them. Yes, they are pricey. I have played about 10 rounds in these and there was no break-in - they just felt good from the first hole to the last. I don't know if this is all about the &#34;boost&#34; material or not, but after my experience with these I will be trying out some boost running shoes. My suggestion is to try the boost on before you buy anything else. Maybe you will agree with me, maybe not.	2015-08-10

But they fit, well, the right shoe fits a little better than the left, as the left is a touch smaller--I can really tell the difference when it's time to cut my toenails. I really like the seamless design. I bought a Wide in womens and they're not as wide as I expected. I figured a D in mens is the same as a D in women's; maybe not. I generally buy men's NB Minimus because they didn't carry a wide width in women's for the longest time. I have a feeling NB is going to stop making the minimus soon and that would be such a shame for me because I've worn these shoes for 4 years now and nothing is as comfortable as these shoes and all other shoes cause me pain in my feet, back, hips, and knees.	2015-08-10

The shoe looks great to me, and once it is on and adjusted, feels comfortable. The problem is that the tongue is anchored to the bottom with fabric, and that fabric seems to roll when I put my foot in the shoes, causing them to be uncomfortable. I basically have to jam my finger down in there to straighten out the roll. After that, they feel good. I'm not sure if mine are different than other people's, because I didn't see this in anyone else's review.	2015-08-10

I recommend stretching out the shoes in trouble spots around toes and heels before attempting a long night out with them.  Great for any event that requires a dress shoe.<br />Craftsmanship: Lets be real these are not made to last forever, but they are perfect for the price. The faux suede is the best I have seen on this type of shoe, because it actually has some durability. Now I wouldn't take them out in bad weather, but it beats similar shoes where it looks like the manufacturer used a flocked velvet to coat the shoe only to have it rub off in two wears, that was not the case with this.<br />Fit: I wear a 6.5 normally and was advised in the comments to go up a size. I opted for the 7 and was very pleased with the choice.<br />Overall its a great little shoe for business, pleasure, or even a dress casual event.	2015-08-10

I was ordering these to be used in an outdoor wedding so my heels wouldn't sink into the ground since I had to stand as part of the bridal party.  I measured my heel and ordered what I believed to be the appropriate size for the heel I had.  The covers were too big.  Before I had even left the hotel to head to the wedding I had lost one, and the other was twisted and half way up the heel and stuck.  We had even superglued them to try to make them work beforehand.  The bride had the same issue with her shoes and this same product.  When we tried them out for a few min on the grass they worked.. but the sizing they say for the &#34;normal size&#34; heel didn't match when I measured my heel. So the product would have worked, but the sizing was off.	2015-08-10

I don't like to waste money. I am also a healthcare worker with a bunion and other foot issue pain, and am on my feet all day. So, when I tried my first pair of Skechers Go Walk 2 shoes and felt how comfortable and light they were, I bought them in 4 different colors! I can wear them all day without foot pain like regular tennis shoes or clogs cause. The soles are very spongy and absorb the shock from walking on hard floors. The only downside to these shoes is that the light spongy soles do wear faster than heavier rubber soles. But the comfort of these shoes is worth it to me!	2015-08-10

Other than that the shoe seemed to be good quality and comfortable.  I will probably order the WIDE and hopefully they will fit better.	2015-08-10

Only shoes that do not cause fatigue from standing a good deal of the day.

They are nice and cushy, but maybe the firmer soles of the Danskos provides the needed support.	2015-08-10

Just got my Purse today. I thought it was going to be bigger. It looked bigger in the picture.  Also in the picture it showed a little grey coin purse. Didnt receive that. But i did get the other makeup bag thingy. The scarf is Not the same as the picture. Its all skulls no crowns. I liked the crowns, but i guess thats the diva in me. Also its silky... i forsee snags and fraying in the future. I guess overall its not that bad. Especially for the price. The bag itself feels strong and sturdy. Just the little things were a bit of a let down but I hate returning things and its not that big of a deal.	2015-08-10

They feel like wearing nothing compared to my old Newport H2's. I bought the CNX as a replacement for my H2's, which are sadly falling apart after years of service. The CNX are (as the name implies) made for the beach/lake/water more than hiking or trail stuff. The design is much more open with larger spacing between the webs and the webs themselves are thinner. They work fine for everyday stuff around town like errands or shopping. I just got back from a cruise and I had them on all day, every day. The only exception was when I had to wear dress up shoes for dinner, but after that I was back in the room changing into my sandals. When walking on the beach, sand easily comes out the sides and doesn't stack up between my foot and the sole. That was not the case with the H2, which I had to take off and shake out if I got sand or small rocks in them. The reason for only 4 stars is because I am accustom to having the cushion of my old Newport H2 sandals, but that comes with having a lighter and thinner sole. I'm willing to make that trade.	2015-08-10

I have ordered Altra shoes directly from them and noticed sizing seemed to run small according to reviews. So I purposely ordered one half size larger.  This style is a new one for me and I do really like the shoes. Altra shoes are wider in the toe box to allow your toes to spread out naturally. If you have bunions, these shoes are great.  Also they I previously wore Kalso Earth Shoes because of the wider toe box but a few years ago, they narrowed their foot bed so can no longer wear them. I am a walker and love these Altra shoes! Altra shoes also have a zero drop heel which means the toe and heel are on the same plane. Kalso Earth Shoes have a negative heel, a lower one than the toe. Both are better than having a higher heel.  They both take some getting used to, if your wear heels alot.  Your achilles tendon (calves) needs to be stretched which takes some adjustment. You wll love these shoes!	2015-08-10

I don't understand why they can't make a good looking shoe. I don't want people commenting on my shoes every day. I just want minimalist shoes that look normal.<br /><br />Most importantly, these are NOT black, they are much closer to gray. It is a very drastic difference when you wear them with black pants.<br /><br />They price is also ridiculous. All of my other vivo shoes were cheaper and they ALL fall apart. I am definitely returning these as the color is WAY off and the inflation in price does not seem justified.	2015-08-10

Mens, kids and babies all follow UK. Couldn't get a definative answer as to what we go by, bought them anyway in case they'll fit but by my crappy luck they're 2 sizes too big. Devastated that I can't find any in my actual size (8, now that I know which sizing to use) anywhere. Will be sending back within the next few days so they can find a new owner who can actually wear them. Gave them a good rating because they are a great looking boot.	2015-08-10

Small inside so it won't hold much beyond your phone and couple of other necessities. Only one small flaw, the connections for the shoulder chain on the bag are bars sewn in and attached inside between the lining and the outer shell.  They don't adjust to allow the chain to move around much and they poke out on the sides of the bag. They do swivel up and down, but they still make the bag hang a bit awkward. Close-up picture of the attachment area included. Other than a small design flaw, super cute and fun for summer.	2015-08-10

I positively do not like Crocs, and he prefers shoes that are completely open in the back.  I found these while searching for leather slippers, and I could not be happier with the product!<br /><br />He wears about a 9D, and I bought these in a 10 since he needs shoes with good arch support and a fairly wide bridge.  These fit those requirements exactly.  They're made of a flexible yet thick rubber material, so I have no concerns he'd slip while walking (which is great, because they don't have carpet indoors).  He hardly takes them off.<br /><br />They clean very easily and don't hold mud in the treads, a feature that's not always easy to find in shoes that can handle going outdoors.  There's only a little bit of space behind his heels, which is a good thing if you plan to give them to someone who has issues with foot swelling.  They look exactly as pictured.  I'm seriously considering a pair for myself.<br /><br />Overall, they'd make a great gift for anyone and are worth the money.  Highly recommended!	2015-08-10

Keeps you close to the ground and provides good foot contact with the road. Some support in the arch and heel; more that a complete minimalist feel.

Okay, let me be honest for a minute and admit that I had I not found this sellers incessant SPAM-LIKE emailing about &#34;customer service&#34; and &#34;please give negative feedback directly to us&#34; annoying and a little sketchy, I would probably not have reviewed this product at all.<br /><br />However, since it's now obvious they are trying to stop people from giving their product negative reviews (which irks me because honest costumer reviews are one of the best things about amazon) I know feel obligated to review this product in full detail.<br /><br />The product arrived on time and as described and if you follow the instruction the item does &#34;work.&#34; However, I think they have gone and made what was a simple effective tool more complicated than it needed to be, and now it doesn't work as well as just a basic traditional shoe horn.<br /><br />The fact that the shoe horn bends MAY make it more comfortable and be better for your shoes, but it makes it a WAY LESS effective shoe horn.

I purchased these shoes a little while back because they were on sale for a really good price.  I recently took them out of the box, and within a week the black rubber on the bottom of the show is hanging off.  It's as if someone either failed to glue the rubber down, or the glue is just bad.  This isn't the first pair of ASICS I have owned that have had this same problem.  I would recommend not buying these shoes.  They also fit too tight near the toe area of the shoe, causing pain and discomfort.  It looks as if my toes will break through the side of the shoe, long before the shoe has any normally expected wear and tear.	2015-08-10

But I need to say something here. For glasses that are just shy of $200, I would expect a little more. They are not built very well. First of all, the glasses start to loosen up as you wear them more so they start to slide down your face because there is no nose pad in the bridge. I liked this aspect at first since often times my hair would get caught in the nose pads.  But now seeing that I need to take the glasses to a Tom's shop for them to heat the and adjust them is just annoying. Also, one of the screws came lose and so one of the lenses popped out. I was doing something pretty active just to be fair but it seemed fixable. I went in with a tiny screw driver and I because the screw is made from softer metal, it was stripped. Now that's pretty cheap considering these glasses are NOT cheap. Overall, I'm not happy. My glasses tend to last me a few years as I take good care of a purchase like this. I bought these glasses 6 months ago and I feel like they are on their last legs. Not ok.	2015-08-10

Even though it is simulated leather, it is well-made and designed. I can fit all my cards into the slots without any trouble. I like that it has a place for coins/bills, and a place on the outside for my phone if I need to go light. It also has a handy place to stow/display my drivers license on the front, so no digging around for it. It is a little larger than I thought it would be so it could pose a problem if I were to carry a smaller handbag, but it's pretty lightweight and doesn't add a lot of heft to whatever bag I'm carrying. I'm enjoying using it, and the peace of mind that I have some protection for my sensitive information.	2015-08-10

They are definitely not good to wear during the Summer, here in Louisiana.  Unless you're going to be inside all day.  But, that's pretty much any boot you may get.  These were my very first pair of 'real' boots and I don't think I could have picked a better pair.  They're very comfortable; and the detail on the boots are exceptional!  I didn't even have to 'break them in'.  I just put them on and wore them...all day, expecting to have blisters when I got home to take them off.  Only because they're new.  I haven't had the first blister, and they fit just like a glove on my foot.	2015-08-10

I've received quite a few compliments on these shoes and they fit perfectly on me.  I am a 10.5 size shoe and have wide feet, and have no complaints about the fit of the shoes.  The only down side to the shoes was as others have mentioned, the very strong chemical smell from the synthetic materials.  It isn't a constant annoyance but when you are riding in a car for any length of time, the smell does make itself known.  I've read that eventually that will go away, but only time will tell.  My advice would be to keep the cloth bags that each shoe comes nestled in for storage purposes if you're traveling, as that does keep the smell masked at the end of the day.	2015-08-10

The thing to know is that there is a break-in period. right out of the box they are intentionally very tight.<br />I have heard of people wedging a tennis ball or water bottle under the straps overnight helps them stretch.

There are too many cute shoes in the world that are also comfortable to wear these. As for the people who claim that they are good to work in, I would never wear something w/ as thin a sole as these & expect them to support my feet all day. Good supportive shoes need a thicker, bouncier sole & adequate arch support.<br />Then there is the narrow, skimpy profile that tries to pull off a boat shoe look, but just looks cheap & fails... The plastic looks cheap when we all know that Crocs can be expensive, so there's no need for the unflattering matte brown finish & the appearance of a shoe design that was thrown together @ the last minute. Even Payless sells nicer looking shoes! This shoe's one redeeming quality is that it easily fits a wider foot-- have to at least give them that.<br /><br />To be fair, the pink & blue version of this shoe was probably a more fashion forward look, but I was not going to shell out more money for a summer shoe in a color combination that I was never going to wear.

I like to be able to feel the ground beneath my feet, and historically I would go out into the garden barefoot for that reason. However, getting holly leaves incessantly stuck in my feet led to a great feeling of &#34;enough is enough.&#34; I have somewhat wide feet for their size, and I have difficulty finding shoes that are wide enough, so I was worried that these would also be too narrow. And technically, they are, my feet spill over the sides of the soles. The canvas is flexible though so I can still force my feet in to them and buckle them up. Over a couple wears, they more or less had stretched to conform to the shape of my feet and are quite comfortable. The breathability isn't fantastic, but I also can't imagine why anyone would wear them for an entire day to begin with. For my purposes, they are perfect, and don't even look that ridiculous until you really scrutinize them. When these wear out, I will likey get another pair.	2015-08-10

Because I would have ordered up a size or a half.  So they seem to run a little smaller than other brands.  Still, after breaking them in, and wearing thinner socks, I haven't had any problems with them.  They are a pretty no frills running shoe though.  For the $40 I paid for them, I can't complain too much.<br /><br />The size issue is mostly just related to ordering footwear online when uniform sizings are more of an industry suggestion than a hard rule.  So as a running shoe goes, it does it's job, and it's cheap enough to take a chance on.  Just think about ordering bigger than what you might normally wear, or go try on a couple pairs first.	2015-08-10

They do have some extra material in the back of the shoe, which I thought was odd, but maybe it's so the shoe doesn't rub on your foot, not sure. I was concerned with rubbing or blisters, as that is a problem for me with a lot of shoes, especially shoes with so many straps, but I didn't have any issues with these sandals, hooray! The heel is different, and I think it's a bit clunky looking. I would have preferred a different heel, but overall this is a cute shoe, gives you some height and it's fairly comfortable.<br />I would recommend giving it a try.	2015-08-10

Visiting the places like Bass Pro, Gander Mountain stores the boots the 11.5 D was too small.  This tells me that they are not using the same sizing in their footwear.  Maybe China's measuring.  Don't know but the size differences are way out of bounds.  Chippewa 11.5 D fits and a 12 from the other places was leaving no toe room.  The wife is going to be ordering her a pair of these in men's sizes as they do not have a zipper style in the women's.  Well pleased and can't wait to do some trekking in Arizona soon.	2015-08-10

I ride a motorcycle, and I was getting on the on-ramp on the highway. Right as I hit 65 mph my glasses flew out of shirt pocket. I turned around and expected to pick up what parts I could of a shattered pair of Ray-Bans; found them completely in tact on the pavement. These glasses hit the ground at 60+mph, onto pavement, and you can hardly tell. There a few nicks that you can see if you looking for them, but other than that they are 100 percent fine.<br /><br />I am completely blown away. I don't see myself ever buying a pair of glasses other than Ray-Bans from here on out.	2015-08-10

The sides are flexible and fit both me and my husband. It is more towards the small side and looks better on me than on him. The frame feels very light and appears to be made of lower quality material. The shades are also darker than our other polarized sunglasses. We bought this pair as a spare to leave in our cars or to bring along while on road trips in case we lose our regular pairs. It serves its purpose well and looks rather trendy. We also like that it came in a nice box with a cloth case that also doubles as a cleaning cloth. 4 stars as it doesn’t feel like it is made to last.<br /><br />Note: I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.	2015-08-10

Wish I would've invested a bit more (I've already ordered another pair). These are true to size in length (I'm a 7.5), but run a bit narrow. No biggie--I used thinner socks. The real problem is the plastic in the shoe that wraps around between heel and ankle started digging into my skin. I focused more on the discomfort than the game. I've used Adidas tennis shoes before so I thought the low price was because it was a basic tennis shoe, not because it was bad quality. I can't return because I already played in them. These are a disappointment.	2015-08-10

The inner heel material has torn and is exposing the hard heel material. The rest of the boot is still in good condition. Overall, these boots held up extremely well, took great care of my feet, and were an awesome value for the price. Going to try the UA Stellar Tac this go-around, but I will definitely be purchasing these Valsetz again, especially for use during the summer months.<br /><br />LOVE these boots. I'm on my feet 8+ hours a day, standing on concrete and marble. I put custom Superfeet inserts in these babies and it's like walking on air. These boots are so light and comfortable, and feel more like I'm wearing a comfy pair of tennis shoes rather than a work boot. Will definitely buy these again when they've worn out.	2015-08-10

Last year I used the Nike Special Field Boot, which are pretty nice, but my feet were killing me after only a day or two in crazy steep terrain. Both big toes were numb for 3 months afterward. It was time for a change. The Salomon Speedcross 3 are super-comfy right out of the box. They fit snug and have a soft feel to them. The traction feels extremely grippy. I've only been using them on morning runs as hunting season begins in a few weeks. I really like the way these shoes feel so far. The true test will be getting them up in the mountains. I wear size 11 and ordered a half-size up to help keep my toes from slamming into the front toe box. I was worried than size 11.5 would look like clown shoes on me, but they feel perfect on my feet and still have a bit of room up front for the steep terrain. The lacing system is fast and efficient. Can't wait to use them in the field.	2015-08-10

They are pretty much adorable with anything, dresses, cigarette pants, leggings, you name it. I haven't had any issues with ripping like some comments. The soles are wearing, but then again I'm kind of wearing them like crazy. They can be a bit killer on the balls of your feet. I bought gel inserts and that has helped. Also, weirdly, the shoe strings are like insanely long. I make it work, but it might be worth buying a shorter pair.<br />Still I would buy these a hundred times over, ...in fact I probably should buy a back up pair...am I the only one who does that with certain things that I think I can't live without?	2015-08-10

HOWever, i use them for an even more demanding purpose.<br /><br />i actually get these 2 sizes up and use to stretch out my cowboy western boots that may be a bit tight lengthwise or need more room in the toe.<br /><br />they have a true natural foot shape that is a great match to the last they use on making shoes and boots, that if your shoe/boot is slightly tight or slightly lacking in length, this can make the difference. note, it will NOT increase your boots a full size, or even a half size...but you may be able to get 1/4 of a size added in length and toe width, which could make all the difference.<br /><br />not that i purposely get shoes small, but when it comes to cowboy boots, i am between an 11 and a 10.5 D...and rather than get the oversize, i get the 10.5 and am able to stretch the leather (yes, the hard front toe portion will expand slightly with some effort). the normal size as a 'boot tree' in these would be a Large, so i go up to XXLarge (two sizes up) and the spring is completely contracted, and i use some effort to stuff these into the shoes, and leave them that way until there is some expansion. i'd say you can get 1/4 of a size increase in length, and up to 1/2 size in toe width, or something like a D to an EE.<br /><br />it helps if you use these with a toe stretcher (the aluminum are expensive but work best), and also break them in with some good walking.<br /><br />that these are truly amazing to help you get that extra expansion/stretch that will turn a very uncomfortable pair of boots/shoes into a winner. this is an extreme use for these, and you may wish to try getting them only 1 oversize, rather than the 2 that i do...but these work so well as stretchers that it is clear that simple use as a shoe tree (correct size use) these would also be the best.	2015-08-10

Wide feet and high arches do not fit well with this shoe.  The tight straps felt like they had no give so would just continue to cut into my toes.

The foot bed fits like a dream, and they are adjustable across the instep.  Fits like a glove.  Then I hooked the ankle strap and was VERY, VERY disappointed.  Never have had this happen before, but the ankle strap sits at an angle the places it too high upon my foot, and it cuts into my leg.  Have tried making it looser and tighter and everything in between, but it's not going to work.  I like these so much I called a cobbler to see if it was possible to reposition the angle, but that didn't seem to be an option.  Have never had anything like this happen before, so I don't think my feet and legs are deformed.  Sadly, I will be returning these.	2015-08-10

They are easy to put on and stay on even while swimming and diving in the ocean.

We purchased sandals but will definitely purchase closed toe shoes from this seller when it gets colder. The seller was great and product shipped and arrived quickly. The shoe is great quality, well made and cute! They have anti-slip pads on the bottom so my son can walk around comfortably and has good traction. The shoes are soft, bendable and allow the tiny feet to work properly due to the flexible sole which promotes the health of foot development and strengthens the arch - we stay away from hard soled shoes which unfortunately are very common and it's harder to find soft shoes, so this is an amazing find at a great price. I've looked for this type of shoe everywhere and it's not uncommon to pay $30-50 for a similar pair from a different company. We're very happy with this product and would recommend it to all parents.	2015-08-10

I have a narrow, size 7 foot, but can wear 7M if they run narrow enough to fit with a sole pad. I was assured that I should buy the 7 and they would be narrow enough. Indeed they were, fitting without any adjustments! I would advise (as did the seller) that if you are a true B, buy a size larger. One very odd thing about these shoes is they are not a left and right shoe -- they are exactly the same but fit anyway!! So -- nice for the price -- yes, they are cute, made well enough to last a season, I suppose, since I bought them to wear with a specific outfit. I haven't worn them yet. Oe more thing.

Okay, really pretty shoes, look great on, about as comfortable as one would expect from 5&#34; platforms for the first few weeks.  But I've had them a few weeks now, worn a couple days a week, and I noticed that they were hurting a bit more than the normal excessively tall heels.<br /><br />So I checked them out, and, right under the pad of the big toe there's this worn spot in the leather insole about the size of screw head (center of picture).  And under that, is what I can only describe as a horribly placed screw head, sticking up about 1/8&#34; above the surrounding cork insole.  The padded cork insole is held down with a metal screw, and, shockingly, after a little wear, the padded cork insole is not as resilient as the METAL SCREW.<br /><br />Yes, ladies and gentlemen who are into women's shoes, METAL IS HARDER THAN PADDING.<br /><br />I mean, I really like these shoes, except the horrible pain of walking on screws.	2015-08-10

After 3days we went for a walk and she was only in her stroller the whole time, as soon as we got home and I took off her shoes I saw blood on the side of the shoes. I was so shock how did it happened again. I checked the shoes and I am pretty sure she got it from the strap.

One 30 mile ride and one 50 mile ride.  The shoes are slightly narrow for my foot, but I could not find anywhere online selling the maxi version in my size and I really liked the shoes.  My right foot is slightly wider and was slightly cramped after my first ride, but the shoes have stretched a bit and my foot was fine for my second longer ride.  I ordered a few different brands and liked the way the mavics fit the best.  Plus in the price range, felt they were constructed really well and of good materials compared to some other brands.<br /><br />I'm using these for road biking and prefer the SPD style cleat over the SPD SL cleat due to being able to walk easier and also not needing to replace your cleats due to them being metal and recessed.	2015-08-10

I wear a size 11 shoe, am somewhat flat-footed (low arched), have narrow ankles and have toes that are a bit hammer-shaped and tend to splay.  Yes, I have very ugly feet--no one will argue with you on that.  I  got these KEEN Venice H2 sandals in 2 colors-- the gargoyle and in the turquoise--and chose to keep the turquoise instead.  But as far as style and comfort, this is the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever had on my feet.  Unlike most shoes, they don't cramp my toes.  I wore them almost every day on my recent 7-day trip to Keystone CO, and they never hurt my feet.  I love them!  My only mistake?  I wasn't thinking and wore them when I went snow-tubing--not a smart thing to do, my socks got soaking wet.  But except for that day (which was my fault) they were great.	2015-08-10

I am a size 8 but my wedding heels are a size 8.5 because they were sold out of my size and they were wearable but my feet slid out when I'd walk. I looked everywhere for options to help, I tried the heel inserts to make the shoes a little bit smaller, that helped but they still slipped out. I then thought about adding straps, most options didn't seem like they'd stand up to a whole day of walking and dancing. But these since they hold from underneath the heel and seem to be made out of sturdy material look like they will do the job. I got them in the white satin color which matches my shoes perfectly. You can tell they are there, but my shoes won't even be visible underneath my dress. So happy I bought this item. Can't wait to wear them to my wedding.	2015-08-10

I really wanted to love these shoes.  So much so, that I bought them several times in the same size and there was always something wrong with the left shoe in each case.  One pair had a left shoe that felt a half size smaller than the right shoe.  Another pair were true to size but had a painful lump in the left arch.  A third pair were sized correctly and had a great feeling arch but the top edge of both heels cinched in and  painfully gouged into my tendons.  They are a beautiful looking shoe, particularly, if you're not a fan of the overstuffed, synthetic athletic shoe look.  But be prepared to gamble on getting a matched pair.	2015-08-10

It's the perfect size for using it as a diaper bag.  Of course, if you're anything like my mother, you can use it for everything under the blue moon and it weight the same as a suit case when you plan on traveling two weeks.  I don't know how she does it, but she does.  I have to say it's made of some really sturdy material.

The absence of dimensions (except on one Amazon.com review) meant that the purchase was a bit of a leap in the dark.  For the benefit of others, the approximate case dimensions are as follows (all in millimetres): Internal: 143 L x 51 W x 40 (22 + 18) H; External: 152 L x 67 W x 51 H.  Fortunately my Flexon semi-rimless specs fit with a little length and width to spare (and plenty - but not excessively so - of height).<br /><br />The case came well packed and seems well made: apparently robust outer shell with zip, soft like-microfibre lining.  Only time will tell whether it is really a good buy (in this case the zip, rather than the springs, is the potential weak spot)."	2015-08-10

They are a tad too big but they are very comfortable while wearing 2 pair of socks - one thin and one thick pair.  I wear toe rings on each foot and was afraid that they would be too narrow at the toes so that I would have to take my toe rings off.  This was not the case.  I wore them all week this last week at the ranch and they were perfect.  Protected me during horseback riding as well as fishing as they had sticker bushes near the pond.	2015-08-10

While I love Baggallini bags for their light weight and organization capabilities, there was one feature that I found to be a drawback.  Since the weather was warm, I did not need to wear a jacket and wore the bag cross-body over lightweight tee shirts.  The canvas strap has very rough edges, and as I walked (many miles), the strap literally sawed a sore spot on my neck.  While the strap is definitely sturdy, which is an advantage on crowded subways and buses, I don't think I would carry this bag again unless it is over a jacket or coat with a collar between the strap and my skin.  I notice that some other Baggallini bags have the strap made of the same nylon as the bag - I think if I buy another I will definitely look for one with a strap like that instead of the heavy nylon canvas.	2015-08-10

OK Shoes, but the toe rubs on my big toes, despite being wide and slightly large.  It's actually very strange, haven't had this issue with any shoe before.

I have worn these shoes exclusively for the last 8 years or so.<br /><br />Recently, though, they've changed in quality.  With my newest pair, my feet hurt after just a small amount of walking. I find my knees also sort of point in a bit, and everything is out of alignment (feet bones, ankles, knees, hips, back).  My toes and the balls of my feet are in pain after even small amounts of walking.  In my hiking boots, I don't have these problems.<br /><br />Prior pairs, before the drop in quality, have lasted me at least a year without degradation in support (at least, it's not noticeable until I get a new pair, but it never outright hurt to wear them).<br /><br />Time to find a new shoe!	2015-08-10

These are incredibly light and comfortable.  Note that the bottom is a softer material which is great for comfort but it won't hold up as well.  I walk a few rounds a week and these are some of the most comfortable shoes I've worn on the course.  However, after two weeks, I noticed small sticks were sticking into the bottom material and leaving small holes when i pulled them out.<br /><br />Just be aware that any shoe with a softer sole material will allow the most comfort but you will sacrifice some durability.  That's just physics and not any bearing on the quality of the product.  That's why I'm giving these five stars.  They are amazing golf shoes and perfect for a day on the course.  If you stay on the fairway and cart path you should be fine but if you're like me and like to adventure out and about during a round then these (and other soft-soled shoes) may not be the best option for you.<br /><br />I enjoy looking for lost golf balls... I find 100 or so balls a month and use them to hit around the yard at home.  It's like an easter egg hunt every time I play:)	2015-08-10

Fit perfectly and was able to wear all day with no problem from the time received. Very nice looking and can wear hiking as well as for casual restaurant dining. Really like that the strap over the heel adjusts with  buckles and elastic instead of with velcro as did my previous Merrell sandals.  Once the leather in those sandals stretched around the heel, the velcro closure did not work well since it could not be adjusted tight enough. I think the buckle/elastic will work much better.	2015-08-10

I wear a 6.5 in other shoes but get a size 6 in the skinny fitflops. The width is good and the length is just barely long enough. If this shoe had a heel it would be too small. I got the black and it looks great with the snakeskin appearance.

The three adjustable straps, funky as they are, allow you to adjust the snugness to your preference.  The heel  height makes it practical for work, and the style and black/tan combo makes it versatile for casual and work-casual attires.  I walk a few blocks from the parking lot to my office building, and the cushion on these shoes keep my feet comfortable.	2015-08-10

For years we bought her the Rockport &#34;Pro Walker&#34; she thought there was no other shoe that gave her this type of support.  The Pro Walker for women is not available any longer, so I decided to go with the Marta.  My Mom's eyes lit up, she was quiet happy with the look, as well as the fit, and feel.  Also, I had bought shoes attempting to find something new and different that she would like.  She would always say &#34;I will keep what I have......I don't like these.  But, she likes the new Rockport Marta.  Thanks!!!	2015-08-10

I wear an 8 in every shoe I've ever bought, I ordered an 8 in these and my foot could not even get in.  Beautiful shoe, brought me to tears because I love them so much but they just are not true to size and I had to return them.  Definitely order a full size up in these, they are also very narrow and very firm so not much give to see if they will 'stretch'.  Had they fit properly I would have given them 5 stars.	2015-08-10

I used to golf in Teva's, but slid around alittle bit.  These are just as comfortable and more stable.  Nice style.  They are just a hair longer than size expected, which is good in my case.  I am about a 10 1/2, and ordered the 10.  They fit perfect.  I really hope that Crocs keeps making these in the future - more styles, etc.  I love golfing on a hot day with a 6 pack, a stogie and shoes that don't make my athletes foot rage - I stick with sandals every time that I can...	2015-08-10

It still feels very comfy after a couple of weeks. But my biggest problem with most shoes is that the support at the heel end isn't very good and the underlying frame starts poking through. And I can already see this shoe doing the same. Someone in my neighborhood was selling a slightly used Nike Air pair, and I actually use that one more than this as that provides better heel side support. I think this Asics is just average.	2015-08-10

I needed to replace my old sunglasses and wanted something that looked similar, and that were polarized. These seemed to fit the bill and the reviews were all very positive, although many of them seemed to be &#34;paid for&#34; by the manufacturer looking to build up a good image. Here is my review:<br /><br />Cons: While I did see that the shipping was a bit longer than usual, I didnt expect it to take 11 business days (15 days total). I ordered on July 24th, and got them on August 7th. I contacted the manufacturer, got a prompt response, and they indicated that the glasses were shipping from China. It seems that these are now available on Prime, so this may no longer be an issue.  Also, they don't fit into regular sized sunglasses cases. When the legs are folded, the depth of the glasses are still quite large. You may be able to squeeze them in, but then you are starting to bend the frames a little and I didn't want to do this.<br /><br />Neutral: They come with a little plastic card begging for good feedback. I guess I can understand why the manufacturer does this, but shouldn't they let the product speak for itself? Almost seems to be &#34;begging&#34;, but then again, it worked. Here I am giving feedback!<br /><br />Pros: the glasses come packed in a sturdy Styrofoam &#34;casket&#34; that ensured these glasses (I got 2) didnt budge. They come with a soft pouch to keep them in, as well as a small little cleaning cloth. They fit very well on my head and look great. I have already gotten several compliments. They are polarized, which is a must (I have gotten other glasses that claim to be polarized and arent) and they are perfect for driving, boating, and running (I used them for all 3 purposes this weekend).<br /><br />Summary: I am normally not a patient person when I order things online. I want it tomorrow, usually because if I order something I need it ASAP. With that said, these were worth the wait.	2015-08-10

Works great, great materials, good functionality!	This review is for the Travel Smart Hand Pouch Bag In Bag Organiser In Cosmetic Gadget Purse Organizer.<br /><br />This is a handy little item I never knew I needed until I owned it. Now I can’t live without it! This is WELL MADE with nice handles, double stitching, lining, and transparent, vinyl pockets in all sizes and shapes. It also features zippered pockets on the side to make items even more secure yet still accessible.<br /><br />The vinyl is thick and great for: seeing through so you can view everything in your purse, and wiping down after you take it out to keep things clean and sanitary in your purse.<br /><br />The handles are fold down and won’t stick out on the top of your purse. I found them easy to grasp and switch the contents of my purse in and out daily when I was changing outfits. I love the neutral blue color and the vinyl is totally clear so you won’t even see it once inside your purse.<br /><br />The amount of pockets on this thing is insane! There are 3 smaller side ones, 2 larger side ones, 2 very large ones with zippered tops, the main pocket, which expands to VERY large to fit small UP TO large purses. Inside the largest compartment, I fit 5 fold up grocery shopping bags, 1 pair of sunglasses, my albuterol inhaler, my cell phone, mirror, makeup items, lotion and assorted other stuff. I put my lipsticks, Chapstick, glosses, mirror, assorted receipts, hand sanitizer and a few other things on all the smaller pockets! I was able to fit EVERYTHING I had my purse previously and then some more! I was relieved at the design that went into this thing to make sure I was able to fit my life in it!<br /><br />Such a great price for a well-functioning purse unit. I would give this 5/5 stars for design, value and functionality!<br /><br />If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-10

These are seriously the cutest little baby bootie shoes ever! I have an Anchors Tula and these go sooo perfectly. They are a tad snug but my kids have chunkier feet than some so I would suggest going up a size or two to make them last a bit. These are definitely more for babies who haven't started walking yet. In my opinion they don't provide the proper support a newly walking baby needs to start off properly.<br /><br />These are so stinking cute though, I just can't get enough! They seem very well made like they will hold up for awhile which is always nice. They are super soft to the touch which is also a plus because I've gotten &#34;soft&#34; baby shoes before and they were all hard and stiff and I wasn't comfortable putting them on my baby's foot. They have a nice hard rubber bottom which I think is good for a standing baby but again not necessarily for walking. I still recommend these for their cuteness factor and at this age that's what matters :)<br /><br />I'm so glad I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review	2015-08-10

I bought the size that I thought would fit and it was a bit too small. Not so much that I won't wear them, but I wish I had the next size. The sole is ok, but it's the straps that are a bit tight. I'm hoping they will stretch a little with wear. I deducted a star for the sandal running a little small. Otherwise, they are comfortable and I like the look of them.	2015-08-10

I normally do not wear flats but these are for casual Fridays to wear with jeans, so I cannot really tell about how it feels on a daily basis. It is comfortable to wear in the office once a week. It is not too casual like sandals and still looks good with jeans.<br /><br />However I hated the green color. It looked like a cheap fabric material. I did not like the shade of the green either, mint green. If it was suede it could have been cute, but with that material looked extremely cheap. If you like green this may be a good fit for you.	2015-08-10

Just got these today. They are great quality. I wish I could have bought a wide or a half size bigger because they are a little more snug in the foot than I'd like. I am hoping they will stretch because they're leather. How they are now, they will not allow extra socks. I ordered the same size shoe I always wear. It's a little tight to put my foot in, but good enough. I don't think I could've found a better pair for the price. I don't feel any arch support, and it is not cushiony. I do have enough toe room.	2015-08-10

I wore them around my kitchen abit thinking I'd just get used to them and see why others rated them so well.<br />Note - I have very high arches .... the heel of the shoe is centered lower on purpose which I believe is the premise of many shoes now like Earth brand.  But the shoe just wasn't very flexible and the shoe bed was harder than I like.  The shoes are also quite heavy and not very attractive.  If my shoes are going to be ugly, they better make up for in amazing support - this shoe had neither - it was just cheap.  So it was returned.	2015-08-10

I'm the kind of person who buys a pair of shoes and constantly wears them until they're too old and worn to go on. I bought these as a replacement for an old pair of flats, and I absolutely love them! The soles are super comfy to walk on, and a couple months of wearing hasn't worn them down at all. I bought the white/gray pair, and the fabric has started to get a bit dirty, but I'm sure that can be easily fixed with a quick wash.<br /><br />Putting them on at first was a bit weird and different, but once they're on correctly it almost feels like you're not wearing a shoe at all.<br /><br />Only complaint, they sometimes tend to flip sideways (on the side of my foot) while sitting/adjusting, and they can be difficult to put back to normal with ease.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with my purchase and would buy these again.	2015-08-10

But they are really comfortable every where else and they look really cool with everything I wear. I wish they had my size in the grey ones too.&#34;  Ok so there it is from the pony's mouth.  I love the price! My son still has me watching for the grey ones so, I don't think the &#34;hurt&#34; is too bad. I did purchase the brown ones about 2 weeks after I purchased these for him.

If you're flat footed, then I probably wouldn't recommend these shoes for you. But if you have a nice arch on your foot, then they perform perfectly. I just got them today so don't trust my review 100%, but I bought a different shoe a while ago. The Take Flight 1.0 and those shoes had less padding than these. I can drop from 7 feet and land well. (Don't try that. You could get yourself hurt unless you're a trained professional) They fit snug if you know your shoe size well. I don't expect my feet to grow much more since they are already 12's (I picked a size 11.5 and it was bigger than I expected, but once I tied them to my feet, they were snug), So I would pick either a shoe size 1/2 smaller (Like from 12, and subtract 0.5), or get whatever your shoe size is. This shoe is amazing for parkour, I can say that, and a great running shoe all around. The bottom of the shoe DOES have grip. Some people are just training on the slippery surfaces. It works very well with concrete, and wood, but metal surfaces can be a bit slippery if it's the wrong kind of metal.<br />5 stars, great shoe, running shoe, Parkour shoe<br />It's a really nice shoe. If you want it, buy it!	2015-08-10

Hmmm, I walk a LOT (my FitBit makes me do it!) but I like to look cute while doing so, if I'm walking to/from/during work. So I'm always looking for comfortable, attractive shoes that I can walk at least a few miles in without pain.<br /><br />I will say that these shoes are 95% comfortable. There's just this one little inner-bump on the side strap of ONE shoe that digs into the side of my foot like nobody's business.It literally created a scab, even with a band-aid.<br /><br />It's possible that the shoes are just a tad too small - I'm between a 7.5 and an 8, and ordered my 'usual', the 38. If the shoe were any shorter, my toes would hang off the front. I think that in the absence of that one area noted above, these shoes would be fantastic - and really, I think this little 'flaw' is just unique to me and my foot (my feet are not well padded. . .) so this might work for others just fine.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Probably not.  But ultimately, I'm keeping the shoes because I've worn them several times and they're really not returnable at this point - I'm going to see about getting some moleskin to put on the offending strap, though, so I can wear them more frequently and for longer stretches of time.	2015-08-10

I bought this at an art show in chicago because I wanted a bike bag that I could quickly remove and use as a purse. I love this bag. It holds my phone, keys, wallet, sunscreen and credit cards.  It takes two seconds to mount it to your bike.  It has a zippered pocket on the inside that you can use as a wallet and a small compartment on the outside that I use to store my emergency Gu. My husband and I bike about 50 miles a week. This is the perfect bag to take along some essentials and quickly remove to go to lunch.  Appears to be waterproof also. I have had mine for a year and it looks brand new.  I updated this to 5 stars because I have now been using it for 2 years and it looks brand new.  It is made out of recycled materials and the company that makes them is woman owned (single mom).	2015-08-10

UPDATE: I have had these just over a year now, and they have become my favorite sandals. the fact that they are softer than the athletic sandals than I'm used to worked to my advantage. When I first got them, the arch of my foot didn't feel supportive like the other sandals and shoes I had for plantar fasciitis, and I didn't think they would work for me. Turns out, that contrary to what my doctors thought, the lack of arch was exactly what my feet needed to feel better. I have even upgraded to minimalist in my everyday shoe, because of these sandals, and my feet are doing better than they have in years. The only downfall I have found with these is that my feet sometimes go a little crooked wth the strap set up.	2015-08-10

The kind prone to taylor's bunions, also sporting a bad case of plantar fasciitis.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, shoe manufacturers nor workout studios don't give a damn. For the former, nearly every shoe I should be using is too narrow. On the latter, concrete/wooden floors are evil. Even more so when they involve jumping jacks, burpees, mountain climbers, pushups, and/or other exercises when pounding is inevitable.<br /><br />These shoes are awesome; the boost thing no joke. That little extra padding goes a very long way in transferring impact on landing. Also, I absolutely adore the stretchy mesh surface that gives my funky small toes a needed break.<br /><br />If you're color agnostic, these bad boys can be had for ~$40. Buy two pairs, amigos.<br /><br />I bought the Boost 2.0 for the better half (complaining of knee problems,)...and knee pain no more.	2015-08-10

Got them for my son to take to camp and he loved them. They are a little narrow so if you get them and they're a little to tight on your child just do the freezer trick.

I've had these boots for about 4 months, wore them mostly every day. Lots of support possibly too much cushion. They are not intended to be worn in the Maritime Environment. These boot got wet from sea water at least once a week and the laces finally rotted and broke. The zipper although some times filled with sand could be zipper with the help of a leatherman. I rinsed them well after every exposure to salt water, but today they finally were toast. A small whole wore on top where they bend for toes. That whole expanded to much and I had to toss them.

I could be used as that, but, the straps are not sewn in that manner.  The denim is nice and the adjustable strap is an excellent length. The outside pocket has another little pocket within it. Nice.  However -  It's Very small.  You can't even lay a 9 1/4 inch hand-fan, or,  a hair-bush,  flat inside it.  Ones wallet might not fit, either - unless it was slid in upwards. It'd probably hold a cell phone, some credit cards, and, really not too-too much more - Take a real good look at the picture, to see what it holds. For me, it's not a  &#34;working&#34; purse.  Also - The top zipper is made in an inferior way - The end of it sticks out - You have to hold that end to slide the zipper open or closed.  The zipper end should really be tucked in and sewn inside, so it doesn't show.	2015-08-10

I want to love it - it is high heeled but platformed so your feet are not in pain and theres the nice rubbery cushioning which helps with comfort .  However, this design in particular pinches my toes quite a bit.  There is not enough room  to fit your big toe through so your toes ends up being painfully squished.  I usually wear size 5 but I got this one in 5.5 but because a heeled shoe will naturally push your feet forward when walking, it just squeezes the circulation out of your toes!	2015-08-10

They have a wide toe box, narrow heel, are extremely light and have great cushioning in the sole.  I only had to add arch supports, but I have a high arch.  Once though I put in Dr. Scholl's arch supports these shoes became my favorite shoes and that is saying a lot.  My last pair of shoes were Merrills to which I also added an arch support and which I also loved.  But these are now a notch above my Merrills, which came as quite a surprise for me.  I will definitely look to Saucony when I need another pair of sport shoes. For now, they are my favorite sport shoes to wear and I look forward to putting them on when I head out to run, walk, and interval train.	2015-08-10

I've had them for a couple of days and only cleaned a smudge off of them with the cloth bag and I already have a few light scratches.<br />The lenses also appear to be a little loose in the frame as it can squeak and move a little during cleaning.<br /><br />Conclusion: these are one of the best low cost sunglasses that you can buy. The lenses could be a lighter to use in more lighting situations.<br /><br />Pros: polarized mirror lenses, frames are nicely built with metal hinges, low cost, good fit, nice cloth bag.<br />Cons: lenses scratch easily and can be a better fit for the frame.	2015-08-10

NOT 12 oz, maybe not even the 10.5 oz it says ON the bottle. You can get good coverage for one large pack and a couple of smaller items like gloves or something and that's it. But beside that the price is ok and the product is impressive. I've used my old pack many times this summer. The dirt just brushes right off and as many times as I've been rained on, the stuff in my pack stays dry. So in spite of the missing 1.5 oz this stuff still gets a solid 5 stars from me. I do wish the seller would change the ad for this product. They are making themselves look bad. Please note-this stuff might work too good sometimes. It water proofed my bivy tent so good that I woke up with a damp interior from the condensation of my breathing! Lol I think you could spray your tent with stuff and then use it for a canoe!	2015-08-10

More like the color of a white gold.<br /><br />One thing about my glasses is that the lenses are not curved exactly the same way, so the reflection in one is more distorted.  I don't think you would notice unless you were really paying attention, but the craftsmanship isn't perfect.<br /><br />Overall, still a very good looking pair of sunglasses.	2015-08-10

Well...I took a chance to buy a HANDBAG for my wife for her birthday (I should know better) after seeing it on Amazon at quite the discount.  It arrived early thanks to Amazon Prime - and my wife received the package from UPS.  So, I showed her the handbag a few days early.  I figured I could still return it and get something else, if she didn't like it.  Well, as it turns out, I've been informed that I have no taste in handbags.  After seeing the bag - and as functional as it might be - it did look like someone used a bunch of spare parts to create this bag.  The workmanship was pretty good, and the materials used seemed top-notch...it just looked a little &#34;frankentein-ish&#34; for my wife's tastes.	2015-08-10

On top of paying for return postage, they require a $12 check to be included in the box. I'm used to Amazon's generous return policy on clothing. I realize that this is not sold directly from Amazon, but it makes no sense to pay shipping twice (once to get to me, once to get back to them), plus $12. It's not worth my time or energy to box up the boots and send them back for what will end up being a dollar or two refunded.<br /><br />LUCKILY this is for a Halloween costume so I don't have to wear them long.

So I was hoping these shoes would be my answer to &#34;what to wear while sightseeing in Italy?&#34; Sadly, they are not. I wore them on a 1-mile walk on fairly flat ground and got the worst blisters on the outside of both of my pinky toes! Perhaps I should've gone up a size? They fit quite comfortably when I first walked around with them. I have fairly narrow feet that are pretty tolerant of a variety of shoes (heels, sneakers, flats, you name it!)

They are cuter than some walking shoes, but not cute enough to keep alongside my stilettos, i.e., the &#34;wear sparingly and while mostly sitting&#34; collection.	2015-08-10

I'm typically a Nike Airmax guy ( 10 pair over the years) who is very happy with their comfort and style, especially with Nike ID where you can design the show but they tend to wear out fast and eventually pop.  I'm 5'11 205 and run on average  10-12 miles a week.<br />After reading many reviews I decided to purchase these Prophecy 4s.  All I can say is I've been impressed since day one.  The comfort and spring is amazing and they definitely don't wear down as quickly as the Nike's sole.  I am not a big fan of the limited color selections but the shoes sure are comfy on runs.	2015-08-10

The biggest issue was that they were pokey. The form of the shoe is made with nylon fiber (like a tight mesh made out of fishing line or fiber optics) with the pretty lace sewn to that on top. Looks great! But in some spots where the nylon mesh was cut, it poked through the fabric into my skin and was very uncomfortable and irritating. I went along the inside of the shoe and with nail clippers trimmed the pokey spots then filed them down with a nail file. I'm pretty sure that resolved the issue for now anyway but I'm not sure if it will last and took me 30 minutes to fix (not to bad really). They came smaller than I expected but totally my fault. I wear 8 1/2 in heels and I always forget to go up a half size for my flats, maybe that's just me. But I can definitely still wear them. They were very stiff so I had to bend them a bunch to get them to feel a bit more comfortable. After all of the work I think I really like them.

These are not at all what they seemed to be.  They are &#34;bifocals&#34; only in the sense that the lower portion is the advertised magnification while the upper section is just plain 0.00 plastic.  They were also exceedingly narrow.  The arms were stretched far out of parallel when I put them on.  Admittedly, I have a wide head but not so wide that I'm unable to buy reading glasses off the rack at the drug store.  I purchased these because I was looking for actual bifocals that would allow me to use half for reading and half for writing on my computer.  These were not even close to being adequate for this.<br /><br />I'm going to be returning them.	2015-08-10

At $5.90 with free shipping, the fact that I finally got it was a victory.  So far, it works fine for incoming audio from cellphone.  However, the comment I recieved for outgoing voice quality was less clear than my other headset (which appears to be identical). The biggest difference I notice is, there are no audio signals when connecting or disconnecting with the phone base.  Not a big thing. The instruction paper was obviously translated (badly) from Chinese.  So I've been using it the same way my main headset is set up.  I only bought it as a backup because it was such a low price.  On that basis, I think it's a decent buy.  I may yet figure out the different features despite the instructions.	2015-08-10

Bought same boots 6 or 7 years ago for central florida yard work - chores.  Had good experience with them.  They are not gore-tex lined.  The leather and a decent soft insole is all you get.  Mine are not steel toe.  Sometimes completely soaked through working on sprinklers, florida rains, etc.  No lining allows them to dry out pretty well over night.  Shovel digging eventually chunked up the soles on my first pair...but they were old by then.  They are not vibram hard rubber soles.  I got more than my money's worth from them.  Just purchased my second pair.  Identical to first.  Soft leather, like well-oiled ball glove...soft soles (not vibram durability though)...comfort right away.  There is exposed stitching inside that could cause blisters for some shapes of feet, but I'm lucky I guess.  I use a thin insole insert on top of the original insole...I don't have big feet...size 8.  I don't need to do this...the size is correct.  It just makes the fit more like a running shoe.  It works for me.  Box says Dominican Republic.  Kind of a different look than most boots.  I've also had wolverines, montrail, other brands, some Gore-Tex, some vibram soles.  Boots are tools.	2015-08-10

I ordered 10 because so many had said just like their normal size, but I needed a 1/2 size larger, and my sister told me she orders 1/2 size larger in this shoe. Love the look.

I completely wore those shoes out and the thong finally broke.  I hope Kenneth Cole will make this sandal style again and again in any color.

Unfortunately I am a 7.5 size and they only come in even numbers. I ordered an 8 and they are a little big, but they came with the heel pads which will not only help with blisters but helps make the shoe a little smaller for my foot. I am really picky with my shoes and only wear ones that have comfort padding inside, but I had to make an exception since no one makes wedding shoes that are comfortable. However, with some open toe slip socks I think it will keep the shoes from rubbing. I am only planning on wearing for the ceremony and changing into more comfy shoes for the reception, but these are perfect for what I need them for. Received LOTS of compliments so far from my bridal party. They really are a great deal and look beautiful in person. I would definitely recommend them and they were shipped very quickly and securely packaged with care. I was very impressed!	2015-08-10

These are the best flats i've found for someone who suffers from ball of foot pain. That being said, wearing them for 4+ hours makes my pinky toes hurt a bit and feel a little crampy, so I have to take them out and stretch my toes out. But given that I feel like no shoes will make my pain go away 100%, these make a really good effort. wish I could say the other croc flats did as good of a job, but so far that isn't the case I've found.	2015-08-10

I bought these running at an outlet mall in Ottawa for $79 with tax... I'm actually very surprised at just how comfortable these are. I went for a long walk and when the walk was over I felt NOTHING.. Not the slightest pain or straining on my feet. And believe me - I have like 15 pairs of running shoes. Some even more expensive- but for some reason this one has an excellent design. I definitely recommend it.	2015-08-10

And I have fairly wide , flat feet.  the 39s are a little big, both lengthwise and width-wise.  but better that than too small, and hopefully they'll be extra comfy if i wear them for traveling.<br />I purchased the mauve dot color - the color is a bit darker than i thought it would be, but still cute.  probably more stain-resistant this way.<br />I can see myself buying another pair in a different color in the future.	2015-08-10

I am a teacher, so I am constantly on my feet. After buying eventually shelving many pairs of shoes from multiple companies, I stumbled upon these shoes in a local shoe store. Desperate for relief from daily foot, leg, and back pain, I purchased a pair. The first thing one immediately notices when wearing these shoes is the amount of support and comfort they provide. The soft foam is thick and rigid enough for comfortably walking over gravel pathways, yet soft and springy enough for all day wear. Another feature that I really love about these, is the width. I have a somewhat wide foot, and I have often had trouble with shoes being just narrow enough to rub and cause blisters. Not so with these shoes. They manage to be wide enough without looking masculine. Another thing that I love, is the affordable price of these sandals. I now own five pairs of Croc's Meleens like this, in multiple colors, and I love every pair. Having a great combination of style and comfort, I recommend these shoes for home and work!	2015-08-10

I ended up having to return these after I failed to find a good fit. Heel slippage was a problem with all 3 sizes I tried, and the toe box was too narrow for my wider than normal feet. It bums me out because these are some beautiful shoes. Solid construction, insane tread, and generally comfortable, but the fit is wonky. That being the case, I can't comment on how they'll hold up over long treks, but having worn them around the house for a good spell, I think if you have the right size feet to wear these, they'll prove to be a great trail shoe.	2015-08-10

Kinds dumb	When I pulled the strings, one of the string holes broke. They steam up, so I cant really see the fun socks. Kinds dumb, but kinda fun. After about a week, the fun wore off. The tops are sharp, so I always have to wear high socks, and fold them over the top of the boot. The bottoms got dirty fast, and they don't clean easy.

These are gorgeous boots. They are also a sonofab to break in. The leather is flat out hard. On me they ride just below my ankle bone. Breaking them in was downright painful. Thick socks barely made it doable. I didn't beat them with a hammer because I was afraid to affect the super sharp look of these. The fit is great. Everyone that sees them loves them. Just make sure you've got the time to break them in before you wear them on a long work day or to a function lasting more than a few hours. They're beautiful but just barely worth the effort. Shine has been long lasting, they take a  polish beautifully and are fairly water resistant.	2015-08-10

Shoes initially felt good, but lacked arch support. Several weeks later, after wearing these shoes almost exclusively, I developed painful Plantar Fasciatis (I have not had that before.) A PF insert eventually helped. Then, the stitching around the front toe area of both shoes began to unravel, although the shoes held together. I would not recommend this shoe.	2015-08-10

I purchased them in the lovely grey neutral color in my normal size, 39-8.5, and they fit well...can adjust the buckled straps as needed.  The leather is buttery soft, so NO BLISTER worries! I just took them on a recent trip to  France and tromped around vineyards and on cobblestone streets in them and they did very well, and we're very comfortable even with the large amount of walking we did.  I did spray them with a protection spray before I wore them, since the suede is a pale color, to protect them from moisture and dirt.  The issue for me is that they are a tad hard to buckle.  But I won't whine any more about that because they are so comfortable and such neat sandals.	2015-08-10

I've tried just about every brand of dress style &#34;slip on&#34; loafers that are still appropriate to be worn in the office.  This has got to be the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn.  I picked up 4 pairs of these to keep in the closet as they wear out.  The best part of the shoe has to be the gel portion of the sole.  They're very comfortable to walk in.  I also really like how the back heel of the shoe is angled.  I have a tendency to wear that part of my shoes out, so since they're angled, I don't drag that part of the shoe when I walk.	2015-08-10

They were slightly tight in the toes at first (with gel insoles), but fine after a week or so.  They're somewhat heavier than typical athletic walking shoes, and I notice a bit of strain on my ankles while walking, but I hope that means the shoes are durable.  (Most walking shoes that I've bought in recent years start to wear out after just a couple of months; I'm hoping these last longer.)  Overall I'm satisfied, but am looking for something lighter in weight (and maybe with a more rounded heel) for long walks.	2015-08-10

He has several pairs of other sandals - all great brands, but for some reason he really likes these.  I think because they are soft/smooth and they stay on.  We had an older pair, and I tried other water shoes, but had to get a new larger pair because this is all he wears.  Those slide on cloth water shoes never fit his feet, and he doesnt love them.  These are great!  They eve give a little traction on the bottom!	2015-08-10

The power step insoles tend to work well for me in general, But this one with the extra cushioning for the metatarsal, is the best match for off loading pressure on the ball of the foot.  Before I got this Insole, I was using dancer pads to help compensate.  Dancer pads do help, but adding that with an insole created so much bulk all my shoes were too tight.  Finding this Insole allows the same improvement when walking without having to use the dancer pad.  They fit perfectly into my shoe.  I'm using the women's 7-7.5 to fit a 6.5 wide shoe size.  This puts the arch support right where I need it, and I have not had to trim the insole.	2015-08-10

These things are super comfortable and have no problem taking abuse.  I broke them in at work for a couple weeks before there first outing.  Climbed Giant Mtn. in the Adirondacks via the ridge trail for a quick 6 miles to see how they handled rocky/wet trails and some low angle slab. Unreal. Grip is outstanding and they are very comfortable.  Then it was time to test how they would do on a long day of climbing.  Started with Saddleback's newish (Irene) slide &#34;Back in the saddle&#34; then went down the cliffs over to Basin, up and over Little Hay to Haystack and back out the phelps to the southside trail to the rt. 73 (garden was full...) total mileage for the day ended up being just shy of 27 miles. The confidence in having traction on the steep slabs and scrambles makes a huge difference.  Also very helpful on quick descents, hopping from wet rock to wet rock down streambeds. I will be buying another pair to have on hand and my wife also has a pair and loves them.	2015-08-10

Unbelievable performance, however, be careful about build-up. It may cause your gear to be ruined with too much thickness,,, then it will begin to peel, resulting in the possibility of you having to replace gear. Much needed research on my part to ascertain if there is a stripper to take it off and start over. If there is a removal, five stars coming. If someone knows of a process to remove this product, please let me know. Hurstsa@live.com  I would really appreciate a shout-out. Thank you!!	2015-08-10

I loved this bag when I got it - the leather is wonderfully soft and it feels amazing. The strap is a great length for use as a cross-body bag, and I like that I can shorten it when needed. The outside pockets are useful. The inside pockets are a little small; I ended up getting a purse organizer.<br /><br />However, I've only had this purse for a little over 3 weeks, and the tassel for the zipper is completely coming apart. (See attached photo). It looks like  it was glued or poorly sewn, but I don't see an easy way of getting it back together to look ok. I'm incredibly disappointed. I'm hoping this isn't a sign of poor quality throughout.	2015-08-10

I am a teacher, so I am constantly on my feet. After buying eventually shelving many pairs of shoes from multiple companies, I stumbled upon these shoes in a local shoe store. Desperate for relief from daily foot, leg, and back pain, I purchased a pair. The first thing one immediately notices when wearing these shoes is the amount of support and comfort they provide. The soft foam is thick and rigid enough for comfortably walking over gravel pathways, yet soft and springy enough for all day wear. Another feature that I really love about these, is the width. I have a somewhat wide foot, and I have often had trouble with shoes being just narrow enough to rub and cause blisters. Not so with these shoes. They manage to be wide enough without looking masculine. Another thing that I love, is the affordable price of these sandals. I now own five pairs of Croc's Meleens like this, in multiple colors, and I love every pair. Having a great combination of style and comfort, I recommend these shoes for home and work!	2015-08-10

I purchased these shoes for my daughters to wear in a friend's wedding as flower girls. We loved the shoes & we received so many compliments on them! I had to order one in white & one in off-white, both colors were correct and matched their dresses. I bought these pretty much as a one time wear deal since they won't be in anymore weddings in the near future and I can't think of any other occasion they would need to wear them but my girls LOVE wearing them for dress-up time and playing &#34;ballerinas.&#34; I would definitely recommend these shoes for a &#34;dress-up&#34; occasion, such as a wedding or a communion. There isn't very much of a structure to the sides so I'm not sure how they would hold up on a child's feet all day, but great for just a few hours.	2015-08-10

US	19965640	R3KS19GVJV1FR	B00JUFT1F6	768915494	Dragon Age Inquisition	Video Games	4	1	1	N	N	Great Game, Just not as a Dragon Age game	I will start of by saying that I would give the game a 3.5 overall if I could but a flat 3 is just too low, so 4 it is.<br /><br />STORY:  As a standalone franchise, Inquisition probably could have been a good story.  As a Dragon Age game, it just wasn't there. The way Bioware tried to link it back to Origins was just weak in my opinion.  The inclusion of characters from Origins could have completely been avoided and felt a bit gratuitous. I feel like they really dropped the ball on trying to tie it back to the previous games. And the big &#34;Plot Twist&#34; during the epilogue just felt completely disjointed.  As I said, were it a standalone game, it could have been much much better. But as a DA game, I just didn't feel like it fit.  3 Stars<br /><br />GAME PLAY:  The game play is ok.  I feel as if the analogy of one step forward, two steps back applies here. Bioware removed a couple of features that were integral to the other DA games.  The first of which is the ability to use magic to heal your party.  Yes, you read that right, a mage can no longer heal your party.  You rely solely on potions and can carry a limited amount of them.  Secondly, you can no longer set character actions.  In Origins you were able to say &#34;If X happens, do Y&#34;. You can no longer do this in Inquisition.  Your choices are reduced to &#34;Follow&#34; or &#34;Protect&#34; the main character.  You can set attacks and actions as &#34;favorites&#34; but it is nowhere near as expansive as being able to tell your mage &#34;when I'm at 20% health, heal me&#34; or telling your tank &#34;Attack the enemy with the highest health&#34;.  The removal of this feature was very disappointing to me as it felt like an integral part of the previous games.  I suppose the inclusion of the &#34;touch-pad combat&#34; was intended to mitigate that but I never got used to it.  In fact I played and beat the entire game using that feature twice; and it wasn't missed.  And the side quests; oy, talk about monotonous.  No variety here whatsoever.  Very long in the tooth.  2.5 Stars<br /><br />GRAPHICS: This is where the game really excels!  The graphics are beautiful! The level design is outstanding and the variety of levels is wonderful.  From the desert levels to the completely forested, to the sea side, each one was done beautifully. Character and enemy design were great.  And the Dragons.....well done!  5 Stars<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK: Again, one of the places the game excels.  The soundtrack is wonderful and reminds me of something you would hear in an Elder Scrolls game. 5 Stars<br /><br />REPLAY: I will probably replay the game at some point as a different class but not any time soon. 2.5 Starstonous.

I am an avid fan of the inFamous series and I can say that this game is by far my favorite!<br /><br />STORY:  The story in this game is as fresh to the series as it is engaging.  I was afraid of what they were going to do with it as I felt inFamous 2 was a bit lackluster. The fact that they use a real city (Seattle) as the setting was wonderful. Sometimes introducing new characters into a series is a big risk but Sucker Punch pulled it off beautifully with Second Son.  There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you engaged and not feel like you are rehashing the story of the first two.  5 Stars<br /><br />GAMEPLAY: I was very refreshing to have a variety of powers not seen in the other two installments. The controls never felt clunky and you always feel like you have total control of Delsin.  The one draw back is the collectibles and side quests.  As with most sandbox games, these get a bit tedious and can become a bit of a grind. 4.5 Stars<br /><br />VOICE ACTING: Incredible!  Like some other reviewers, I immediately missed Cole.  But as the story progressed, you could definitely feel the emotion and each actor fit the game character perfectly.  5 Stars<br /><br />GRAPHICS:  Very good! The game design and character modelling was done wonderfully.  Advertised as a &#34;next gen&#34; game on release....certainly doesn't disappoint.  5 Stars<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK: Loved the music to this game.  It was very different from anything I had heard previously and it fit the game wonderfully. 5 Stars<br /><br />REPLAY:  Played it back to back.  Massive replay-ability as it maintains the &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; plot lines. 5 Stars<br /><br />As I stated above, this game exceeded every expectation I had for it.	2015-08-10

A completely original orchestrated soundtrack, a fun twist on beloved childhood characters.  The game continues with its wise-cracking characters and the subtle hints towards the fourth wall.  The game changes direction from the standard 3D platforming and aims more towards a new demographic of building and customizing vehicles to complete various challenges.  Coupled with a dramatic increase in graphics, Spiral Mountain has never been more beautiful.  If you're looking for a true Banjo-Kazooie 3 game, this is not the game for you.

Bluetooth dongle which auto pairs when plugged in.<br />The included headset is easy to set up, and fairly well made, although I found its sound quality to be less than stellar. I attribute this to an issue with lack of shielding from the headset to the mic itself which renders some echo and static.<br />With testing across multiple headsets I found the best sound quality generated from a Plantronics model M50 headset, (voyager 320,340, and &#34;generic&#34; were also tested.)<br />The dongles performance is decent with roughly a 30-40 ft. range as standard with Bluetooth, and with degrading quality from there.<br /><br />I found with a bit of experimentation that I could design a holder using an extension to change the angle of the dongle to upright, which is more fitting for this style transmission, and achieved ranges something in the tune to the upper 30's.<br /><br />When auto pairing does not find a device it continually tries and sends the PS4 into a loop of &#34;mic connected disconnected.&#34;<br />The simple solution to this would have been a hardware force to pair button, and I believe another model has this function, although I have yet to contact the manufacturer to see if an exchange is viable. Regardless this is the model I am reviewing, so it's an issue for me as I must unplug the dongle between uses which is a bit bothersome.  A simple workaround I have eventually planned is to design a long cable extension to go on topof my entertainments center with a simple switch to turn off between uses.  I am aware that not everyone is able to do this, but with elevation, vertical placement and possibly a slight signal amp I think I can get transmission ranges to the tune of the upper 40 foot range.<br /><br />So lets get to a bit of a summary for this regarding cons:<br />Constantly polls giving the PS4 multiple personality disorder<br />Stock headset is metallic sounding with tinny echo and poor range.<br />Suffers from a classic issue with radio placement in which the overall range would be far better if upright. (although easily fixed.<br /><br />As far as the Pros go:<br />It's just about fully universal (I have not yet tested with stereo units, but that's around the corner.)<br />Works really well with certain model headsets. (just not the one it comes with)<br />You can untether yourself from your controller without shelling out $100 for inferior usb. (Thanks for the cash grab Sony)<br />You can pour a cup of coffee while chatting without risking your controller (see above)<br />While using, as your sound is now isolated, controller battery times go back to typical ps3 controller times as the unit is not driving speakers.<br />It is fairly reliable and pairing is incredibly simple (although I would have liked a momentary switch or even a &#34;pairing mode&#34; function)<br />It does what no other current device does, effectively allowing you to use a simple headset, run your sound through your stereo without being forced to a single headset brand. (This is the big one which sold me!)	2015-08-10

There a lot of optional areas, a lot of optional espers, and in the midst of all of this a very compelling storyline.  Each character has his or her important part to play.  No one seems like a 'token' and you see growth in perhaps all of them except for Fran [who keeps to herself].<br />The romance is subtle--Ash wants revenge for her lost love and Balthier and Fran keep it professional but are clearly together.<br />Great voice actors, and the world is ENORMOUS.  You won't get bored.<br />I think what people do not like about this game is the gambit system.  I personally like being able to go into an area and not have to button mash.  Also, because the enemies can be very, very fast, without your gambits set up well, it can be the end.  That is, unless you adjust the battle speed.<br />I wish that the license board was a tad bit bigger.<br />And I wish Fran's stats weren't so deplorably low.	2015-08-10

I'm going to chalk it up as another lesson about why I should never buy non-OEM parts in certain situations.<br /><br />This battery charged in two hours or less (I walked away after plugging it in, my DS Lite wouldn't even power on with the original battery in it after sitting in a drawer for a couple of years). When I pulled the cord and started playing Puzzle Quest Galactrix (weird obsession, don't judge!), the battery only lasted 9 minutes.<br /><br />I thought maybe it's just a quirk of a new battery and all, so plugged it back in and walked away once I saw it was charging. I remember getting many hours of use out of the DS Lite when we were using it regularly, so after it was charged with the new battery again, I unplugged and continued my game. 9 minutes later, the red light is blinking and then it powered down.<br /><br />Fast forward to six days of this, just because I'm like that and need to make sure I'm not crazy. This battery holds just at 9 minutes of charge before flatlining. About fifteen minutes ago I ordered a proper OEM replacement battery direct from Nintendo. $15 + $5 shipping, which is about 3x as much as this battery, but I feel much, much better about life now.<br /><br />In short: do not buy this. Some have had decent results. Most seem to be in my boat. Just spend the extra money for the proper part unless you dig gambling.	2015-08-10

What annoys me is I have to download EVERYTHING, when I pluged in the destiny and got my self ready for a good time and then it first asked me to log in to the PSN, fine, I did that and it told me to download a 6 gigabites update without which I could not play. So I said fine and pluged in the Bat man, and there is another 4 gigabites! Desperatey I looked for netflix and tried to find a video and I found out that I can't watch them online...

The controller is just as good as the old one, but if you were looking to use your phones Headphones with this controller think again. Microsoft decided that they would follow a different standard then the vast majority of headphones makers (iphone, mac, and most android phone). Any headphones using the CTIA standard will not work properly with this controller. The audio will come through, but due to using the OMTP standard instead of the more commonly used CTIA standard, you will need to buy an adaptor to use the mic and controls with this controller.  Oh, and did I mention I have yet to be able to find an adaptor that functions with this controller? Its not for sale on Microsoft site, nor at my local electronics store. So, if you're just looking to replace your broken controller this controller is more than fine, but if you are hoping to use the new head phone jack, make sure you have the correct kind of head phones before you buy.	2015-08-10

White Classic Gamecube Controller	Video Games	5	2	2	N	N	This was fine tuned for Smash Bros	Seeing how this controller was pretty much made to play Super Smash Bros with, I would say that it has been fine tuned for Smash Bros. Then again, I really hate the Wii U Gamepad, and classic controllers. They're big, bulky and I can't use them at all to play Super Smash Bros with. I had to buy this Gamecube controller and Gamecube controller adapter to enjoy the game.<br /><br />I bought this controller to have an extra controller around or in case I just needed another gamecube controller around. With that said:<br /><br />- This controller was pretty much manufactured for Smash Bros. It exceeds the Hori Gamecube Controller in terms of both quality and functionality.  I do not understand why Nintendo did not make first party controllers that work with the Wii remotes or console itself.<br /><br />- I have got over 270 hours into Super Smash Bros and most of those hours this controller has been used.<br /><br />- This feels just like the controllers we all love and used for Melee.<br /><br />- The wires are nostalgic. Because of the wires, we save in price. How awesome is it that this didn't cost us as much as controllers for other consoles?<br /><br />- This can only be used with Smash Bros, which does suck. I want to use this with games like Mario Kart because once again, I hate the gamepad.<br /><br />- You must have the Gamecube Controller Adapter to use this.	2015-08-10

It came out very late in the systems life span right before Nintendo stopped making games for SNES altogether.  I always thought FF3 and Mega Man X3 were both rushed onto the market at the last minute.  FF3 has some nice features.  I loved the ability to choose your path through the game so you are not having to replay the same 7 stages over and over again. I liked the inclusion of the Super Meter bar and the dash moves as well.  It helped speed the game along. FF2 was a very good game but it moved at a snails pace if you chose Haggar. FF3 isn't bad but the one thing that hurts it is the challenge factor.  This game is way to easy.  If you want any kind of challenge you have to set the bar to the highest meter every time you play and use a weak character like Lucia.<br /><br />Story:<br />The story isn't much to speak of.  Normal day at the office for mayor Haggar when a riot breaks out right in the middle of Metro City.  So all 4 characters head out to clean up the streets.  Maybe the Mayor is trying to save money and cutting down on the law enforcement payroll.  After you see a huge hole in the wall at the beginning where you can tell someone broke out of a cell in the background I was expecting a much more grand final boss.  It would have been better to have a intro/cut scene to explain who the main villain is?  How did he become king of the Mad Gear gang?  Was he a lieutenant who got promoted?  He reminded me of &#34;Rolento&#34; from the first Final Fight Game.  Not a lot of explanation or plot development.  The ending is pretty much the same for all 4 characters so there is not a lot of replay value added to play through the game as a different character.<br /><br />Play Control:<br />This is where the game shines.  The characters all move effectively and with the expanded moves offered you really can do a lot with each character.  The controls are very responsive and the characters feels smooth not stiff or sluggish.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Guy and Haggar are fun to play and you can zip through the game pretty easily with either character.  Lucia and Dean both pretty much suck.  The villains are just so so.  Some bosses you will recognize but most are one dimensional and require little strategy to defeat.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br />There is none the game is a breeze.  The first FF game for the SNES is extremely hard and it is hard to just make it halfway through the game.  FF2 the difficulty was evened out and is a solid game all the way around.  FF3 though is way to easy.  Even novice players should finish this game quickly.  This is one of the reasons the game seems unfinished.  One thing that Double Dragon always had over the final fight series was the environmental hazards through the stages.  It would have been nice to see some of those elements put into this game especially in the Steel mill.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I always compare the Final Fight Games to the old Double Dragon series. Very similar storylines and plots. The game has updated moves and features but the challenge is nowhere to be seen which really hurts the replay value. Its a nice game to play through once but definitely not worth owning.  Very average game 3 stars.	2015-08-10

As long as you have this newer controller it is very easy to operate. Simply plug it into the 3.5 mm jack and you're good to go. There are 2 basic physical controls - a mute slider and a volume adjustment knob.<br /><br />Incoming and outgoing audio quality is decent and perfectly fine for its intended purpose of voice comms. The best aspect of the headset is it's long duration comfort qualities. The slotted ear cups provide ventilation, sits very gently on your ears, does not press into the arm frame of your glasses and has an 'open' cup design allowing you to freely hear the game audio through your TV's audio setup. The boom mike utilizes a thin stick with full flex motion that is easily adjusted to keep out of your sight lines.<br /><br />While the headset is clearly branded and designed to complement your X1 experience (eg - the green accent trim) the use of the 3.5mm jack provides flexibility to utilize the device with other systems such as the PS4 (all controllers have a 3.5mm jack) or even as a voice chat mike plugged into your phone. Terrific value, comfort and functionality.	2015-08-10

We have purchased some of their lower priced controllers in the past, like their Rock Candy line.  While the products always functioned as expected, they did feel less durable than their OEM counterparts.  It seems like PDP is really stepping up on their build quality with recent products, and the Afterglow AG 7 headset is emblematic of this.<br /><br />The AG 7 feels really solid.  It is adjustable for large to small heads, and the top strap has quality padding that should last quite a while, with a firm grip holding it on your head without being uncomfortable, though it could get sweaty after a while.  The ear pads are also removable, and the interior of the headphone is accessible, so modding is possible.  However, putting those pads back on is not easy at all.  The size adjustments click firmly into place, and don't slide around by accident.  On the whole, it feels well built and strong, with solid plastic and metal holding it together.  I expect them to last a fairly long time with regular use; as long as they are not bent unnaturally far in any one direction, since they do not fold DJ style.  They have not given up on their trademark color schemes for the Afterglow model line – this one glows a bright neon green while in use on Xbox One; for other uses, the glow is entirely optional, and just wastes batteries.<br /><br />When plugged into a PC, the AG 7 identifies itself as an Xbox One controller. Since it does not identify as a sound device, Windows can't use it as one.  Of course there are no controller buttons, so it can't be used that way either.  There is a 3.5mm jack that can be used like every other headphone, but none of the extra features are available when used this way.  My cellphone did register it as a headset, and the microphone sound was very clear for the other listener.  I had much less success on PC, as I couldn't get the microphone to work acceptably there.<br /><br />On Xbox One, the system instantly recognizes it as a headset and will quickly route sound and chat functionality to the headset.  It was pretty much plug and play, and it worked very well.  I don't play Xbox games online, so I wasn't really able to test that part, but if it sounds as good as it<br /><br />So, after all of that, how does it sound?  Well, it still follows the unfortunate modern pattern of boosting the bass above most other frequency ranges.  The nice thing about PDP here is that they actually put their frequency response chart right on the box, which I greatly appreciate.  They compare Pure Audio with Bass Boost, and show competing response charts with them both.  Bass boost pushes up everything from about 200Hz on down by about 10db, which is quite a lot.  The graphs also show a large spike at around 9-10KHz, which does noticeably improve the high end compared to other gaming headsets we reviewed recently, like the SteelSeries.  Unfortunately, most of the midrange and lower treble is still substantially recessed, and it sounds that way.  But at least they are honest about it, and for that, I applaud them.<br /><br />If it's not obvious, I am not a fan of the massively boosted bass on modern gaming headsets.  It's mostly because I know what good audio sounds like; I have invested much in my home audio system.  But, by publishing the frequency response graphs, it is much easier to make intelligent equalizer decisions to make them sound much better for PC or mobile use.  With some strategic cuts (and a few boosts, also) they sound pretty good after all.  My biggest disappointment, outside of how they sound unequalized, was that I could not get the microphone to work well on either of my PCs.  And that it's wireless only on Xbox One.  But, there it works quite well.  If I ever had a need to play Xbox One without my normal speaker system on, or play a game that my children should not hear, I won't hesitate to grab the PDP Afterglow AG 7.y Xbox One without my normal speaker system on, or play a game that my children should not hear, I won't hesitate to grab the PDP Afterglow AG 7.	2015-08-10

I am currently using Astro A50's, but since I constantly switch between PC and Xbox, I figured I would just buy an xbox specific headset.<br /><br />They arrived and looked very nice, packaged well, and came with the cool chat adapter. I set them up and immediately realized there was a buzzing noise that was interfering with the headset's frequently. I searched through all my devices and turned things off, but simply could not figure out what was causing the buzzing.<br /><br />The next thing that I did not enjoy was how uncomfortable they are. Obviously astro's are just the best and should not be compared to these, however I do have to say that this headset was not designed for someone with a large head. They squished my head immediately and it was very uncomfortable. Now I assume this might just be me having a melon-sized head, however I with there was a way to adjust the width.<br /><br />The ear cuffs are the fabric cuffs which actually are made to breath better than leather. I found this to be false, as they were very warm within minutes of me puting them on. Also, maybe i have a horribly deformed head, but the ear cuffs BARELY fit over my ears, and just kinda crushed them in there.<br /><br />I do like how the controller comes with the chat adapter and runs off the controllers battery, but they were too uncomfortable and buzzed in my ear.	2015-08-10

The rubber had been coming off of them. What I did was rip all the remaining rubber off the sticks. I then put these on and they fixed the problem completely. Not only do they provide a grippier feel with less slippage (then a new controller) but the extra height gives a little better leverage for aiming in games.<br /><br />I didnt see this addressed too much in the reviews here. Important to note one thing though. If you have uneven rubber on your analogs, from wear, you may need to rip the rest off for it to fit on properly. If the rubber is uneven before placing them on they wont fit right. I had this issue until I ripped all the remaining rubber off. This shouldnt be an issue if your controller is already worn out, since these are a permanent fix and WILL fit tightly without coming off, in my experience. They are very cheap and you get 4 of them, so its very easy to replace them but they seem like they will last a very long time.<br /><br />Wasnt sure which brand to go with but after getting these I can confirm that they are a great fix for the ps4 controller	2015-08-10

Its a great game but it has some stuff about it i dislike. For example when I went to take my skills test to see how challenging my workouts can be each week my remote did not register. I was doing the exercise like I was supposed to and it stopped the test immediately after that when I knew I couldve done alot more. Its frustrating to be doing a workout exactly as the trainer is on screen and the wii remote doesnt register it. I noticed alot of the workouts did this. I guess it really doesnt matter if it does or not but I would like for it to be accurate in how many calories I am burning. As long as I sweat I know it is giving me a workout and I guess thats all that matters and I can promise you with this game you will. It can definitely help you reach your goals.	2015-08-10

What a refreshing take on a beat-to-death genre.<br /><br />Things I like compared to other shooters:<br />1. No one &#34;camps&#34; because it does you no good in this game.<br />2. You spawn in the same spot every time. I find this a great idea because it makes it so much easier to learn the map.<br />3. The paint guns aren't like anything you've ever played with before. Which makes it so fun to tinker around with the different classes, sub weapons, and special moves.<br /><br />I played this with a friend of mine that I play Destiny and COD with, and he was asking me how much a Wii U is after playing.<br /><br />If you haven't bought a Wii U, this game might put that decision over the top. There's already a bunch of great titles, but this is just so different and fun that everyone who's ever enjoyed video games must experience.<br /><br />NINTENDO: keep the DLC coming!

I am actually disappointed I haven't played this series long ago. This is hands down the funnest game I think ive played in a loooong time!<br />The graphics are absolutely adorable, cheerful and fun. Everytime you play, you cant help but to just feel happy and relaxed.<br />This game has absolutely no stress to it. Some activities you can do are catching bugs, fishing, collecting fossils, gardening, decorating and upgrading your house, fixing up your town up etc.<br />There are TONS of bugs and fish you can collect to fill up your encyclopedia and your towns museum. This can take weeks months or even years to complete since some fish and bugs are extremely rare. You can even collect badges for collecting a certain amount of items etc<br /><br />I also love how all the cute animal villagers in your town each have their own distinct personality. You may find you like some of them, you may find you dislike some of them. But they are all extremely different with different dialog so it keeps the game fun and interesting!<br /><br />And - This game takes place in real life time. When its night in real life, its night in the game, same with morning etc. You get rewarded the more you play. You will find yourself unlocking new shops and activities each day you play.<br /><br />Overall WONDERFUL game. If you have a 3ds, you need this game.<br />I have been playing it ALL day, everyday, never getting bored, always wondering if i'm going to run into something rare. And always wondering what each new day is going to bring me.	2015-08-10

It might be due to the amount of use I give them; I only use them for a few days a week, but when I do I'm dead to the world for hours. Anyway, I'd still suggest them, if they're on sale.	2015-08-10

The control scheme is horrible and seems to change on you. Parts of the story are a pathetic attempt to get us all to buy into more social programs - hey i wanna play a game, not get recruited into the democratic party. Never has the time of talented people like Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe been so completely wasted; a script like this was more deserving of monkeys. I have seen marketing that says 'just like Last of Us'..... Marketing lies since this is nothing like Last of Us.

I brought this game off of Playstation Store, which has the game in English instead of Japanese (as other reviewers have said). So this review is about the game itself, NOT the product being sold here.<br /><br />1. The Story<br />Great story! Humanity is on the verge of extinction by an alien race, and that's when BRS (or Stella) awakens and so begins Humanity's counterattack! However, the plot focuses around Stella herself, and has some great turns to it.<br /><br />2. Gameplay<br />The battle system is more than just pressing buttons. The enemies have different attack patterns that you can figure out, remember, and react according to. You've got to use your head and not let your guard down, but the system is easy to use, and the different skills allow you to adapt and change your fighting style. Includes both offensive and support skills, along with passive skills that you can find by exploring the map.<br /><br />There's also a number of challenges you can do to increase your stats, get new skills, or get new outfits or weapons! Along with unlocking pieces in the gallery.<br /><br />3. Once you complete the game...<br /><br />You get to aim for the real ending! After that, you get access to a lot of EXTRA missions and fighting the Class-A aliens all over again. I was honestly surprised by how much more there was to do after getting both of the endings.<br /><br />4. Others<br />The voice acting is great for all the characters, and the graphics are nice and fit the game great. The music is great, Stage 4 especially fits the mood after what happens. Also, during some of the overhead dialogue you'll get to choose how you want to respond! The overhead ones don't affect the game (other than what is said in response), but in one of the PSS and NANA missions each, you'll get game-changer/movie scene-changer choices.<br /><br />Overall, this has to be one of the best games I've ever played.	2015-08-10

The home interface is simple and runs smoothly, They have a surprising number of great games and more to come for all ages. I have owned this product for about 6 months now have yet to find a downfall, comparing it to my xbox one console the ps4's overall appearance is slick and just feels right compared to the xbox ones bulky, bricky design. Hardware specs the ps4 does have an advantage with a stronger bandwidth, 1152 gpu cores compared to xbox's 768, and a stronger system memory. as far the price tag, the 50$ difference is so worth it in my opinion. Sony has outdone themselves! (coming from an xbox one user)	2015-08-10

It's a great game on a technical level and environmental design, with a cool sci-fi soundtrack to boot. Everything else about the game has both highs and lows. When it comes to the fighting, there is a wide variety of actions available to the player. However, the Batman cloned fight mechanics could have been so much better. There is no true flow to combat. Sure, you can continue your combo once you leap frog but if that punch or kick isn't to that same enemy within the allowed amount of time, you're screwed. The platforming is really good but unfortunately that's all there is to this game. It's just platforming, platforming, fight, platforming, cut-scene, platforming, fight, platforming. It's like something is missing in-between because basing an entire game around climbing gets old fast. The memory remixes are awesome,so you can understand why Life is Strange uses the rewinding and fast-forwarding as a core mechanic. Unfortunately, it's so underutilized that it makes you want more similar remixing scenarios in the game. It's such a shame.  I don't want to be one of those people that goes &#34;for a game called Remember Me, it sure isn't memorable! HAHA!&#34; It's a good game with poor execution in major areas but it's also forgivable. I'm glad I got through the game and finished it. Life is Strange was probably the right way to go for Dontnod but it does make me hope they try a bigger project like Remember Me again.	2015-08-10

There were also a lot of really awful things about the game (most noticeably, the ending) that were just awful, to the point that it took away from my ability to enjoy the great parts.  I'm a huge fan of the series, and it just makes me sad to think of how much I did not enjoy this game.  I had such high hopes for it.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />SPOILER<br />SPOILER<br /><br />SPOILER:  For those that played the DA2 DLC, &#34;Legacy&#34;; remember how Corypheus just rolled out of that slumber and hit us with a fast paced, creative battle that, even if you got the rhythm of it, was a lot to handle at once?  Don't expect that again.  Apparently he sat around thinking about how not to fight a war, for all these years.  The final battle was definitely a sheer button masher.  The only tactics involved were, &#34;Don't get hit by the periodic ranged attack&#34; and &#34;if you play a melee class, expect to run back and forth a lot&#34;.  If you play a mage or archer, it's even more disappointing.<br /><br />Your actions in the game have very little effect on the ending of the game, and there is no real risk of losing anyone.  Even in DA2, you ran the risk of having to kill one of your companions, if your politics were in too much conflict.  This, you're fine.  There's one way to fight.  There's one ending.  It's done.  There are different ways it can end in the slideshow epilogue; but they are focused more on leaving options open for the next game, so you shouldn't expect anything about your companions, the Inquisition as a whole, or most of what you did.<br /><br />The politically correct overhaul of the Qunari was the worst part for me.  The Qunari were my second favorite part of the series (after the Grey Wardens), and it really got on my nerves to see them retreated in such a way.  It resulted in me really hating The Iron Bull, which was another big disappointment for me.  If they wanted toinclude the mercenaries, Krem would have been a much better and more interesting companion.<br /><br />Stories like Blackwall's really helped pull it out for me.  It was just so full of fantastic and horrible, with a sea of button mashing turn-in quests in between.  I wish I could hate it or love it, but instead I'm just very disappointed in it.  I love to play the same game over and over.  I've played it twice so far, and I'll play it more (at least once for each romance); but it will become a back of the shelf title for me.  After I get through the last of the romances, I probably won't play it again.	2015-08-10

The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly.	First, I don't know weather to give it one, or two stars...I'm on the fence...so, I'll give it two. I give it two, because I am a HUGE TRON FAN. I have seen the original, I know over 300 times, probably close to 400...if not more. I love the glow of the controller. It definitely has a very tron feel and look to it.  The Good. Unlike other users, I have not had the same controller malfunction issues with mine and I have about a hundred +/- hours on it.  The Bad. Although I have not had the same controller malfunction, as others, the controller [does] have some unintended movement artifacts in it. E.g. If I'm standing still, it will move slightly...sometimes. This is not an all the time thing.  The Ugly. I have had a malfunction in my controller, unlike the other users posting here. My malfunction comes in the part that is at the end of the cord....the breakaway cable, about 6 inches in length, including the USB plug. That barrel plug can be disconnected, to replace the breakaway cable. On my controller, that breakaway cable has an &#34;open&#34; in it, about in the middle. I contacted PDP, the makers of the controller, about the issue. They said they no longer make the controller; however, they would be able to send a replacement breakaway cable to me at no charge.	2015-08-10

I liked Battlefield 2 and 4.  Didn't buy 3.  The way I determine whether a game is a lot of fun is whether I can continue playing it without getting tired of it.  I was excited when I bought this game, but after trying it for a week or so, my assessment is that it simply is not as engaging and enjoyable as the previous releases.  The whole police/criminal is just kind of lame.  The weapons offerings, and the ability to earn more weapons/equipment are not that great.  You have a rank-promotion system like in the previous games, but, at least as far as I can tell having gotten to rank 10, you don't earn anything that makes playing the game more fun.  My advice would be to pass on it and wait to see what they come out with next.  I am going to trade it in and re-purchase the Battlefield 4 game.	2015-08-10

I did see a gamespot review of a 9 a long time ago, but often assume certain games get overrated so I didnt pick it up right away.  It is actually a first party sony game, which sony puts out the best games on its system.<br />This game is easily on the level of the best games on the system, without a doubt. The presentation (sound and visuals, art style) is one of the best Ive seen, especially for a mostly side scroller type of game.  Boss fights are some of the most entertaining Ive played in any game , despite genre.  They are fleshed out like something youd see in a god of war game, not a side scroller.  Way above and beyond what youd see in any mario game as far as bosses. The traversal is very creative too and the game constantly switches up the environments and style of gameplay to keep the pacing constantly fresh.  Mastering that type of pacing is something very few games achieve.  The game is nonstop and never drags.<br /><br />Cant say enough good things about the game. Its worth much more then its price.	2015-08-10

The gameplay and story are engaging, and the weapon-glyph system is fun to use.<br /><br />The Metroidvania elements are a little less pronounced here, as there are generally fewer movement-based obstacles to exploration than what one might expect in &#34;Symphony of the Night.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed many of the Action-RPG elements, especially the weapons system that differs in stats, speed of use, and geometry (space on the screen that is counted as a hit).<br /><br />My primary complaints?<br />-The difficulty curve is a bit uneven.  I found some sections to be trivial, while others brutal, and it wasn't terribly consistent.<br />-Some important items are far too difficult to gather, either because of absurdly low drop rates or overly picky platforming mechanics.	2015-08-10

This is a great HDMI cable it is nice and thick yet pliable.  It is very well made and for the price you can't go wrong.

We needed to replace the battery in our Wii U unit and this allowed us to do so. It is a high quality rechargeable battery, and long lasting too! There isn't actually much to say here other than that I am glad I got this one, save yourself some money and get it here instead of buying name brand. This one has overcharge protection so that it won't be damaged from leaving it on the charger too long and it lets me play all the silly nintendo games I want :-)<br />I received this product as a sample in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

With that being said, this is an awesome game for kids!! My 9 year old niece was who I tested it on. She loved it!! I heard her in the other room talking away and really  getting into the game. When I came in the room, she would say &#34;Come look at this...Hey, Watch this&#34;. She loves it. When she comes over, she always asks to play it for little bit. I limit computer time, but I am sure she would stay playing on it for long periods of time if I let her. The characters look like they do from the movie and the images are nice a clear and doesn't look like a cheapy program. So far, she hasn't had any problems with it freezing or messing up while playing. To me, when I tried playing, it was a little confusing because of all the buttons you have to push... but she had it figured out in no time, so I have no doubt if you are buying for kids, they would figure it out no problem. This is an awesome game for the price for sure!! Wholesome fun!	2015-08-10

Other than that the controller is very solid, the button layout is basically the same as an Xbox controller, the buttons and D-pad don't feel cheap at all and have a glossy finish, but the start and select buttons are both rubber. but i feel like you do need to have more applied pressure with certain buttons, analog sticks feel really good and do click if pressed down in the center, the triggers were more like buttons, and were definitely in a weird place but it is very easy to get used to. the manual was poorly translated to english but it was still understandable, and does come with a Micro USB cable for charging, also the battery life is really great! long story short, if your looking for a small budget, but still good quality bluetooth controller, then this is the one for you	2015-08-10

First of all, I didn't buy from amazon, but I couldn't help to make comment here. As a customer, I am getting angry. Game producers are creating rediculous products, and seriously I don't think they ever care about customers's experience.<br /><br />I got the game from PSN+ game download. The download is ~30G, I was super excited. After hours of downloading, finally I was able to start the game.<br /><br />And then the game asked for downloading updates. 9 updates.  OK fine.<br /><br />The first update 630MB.  OK, I was still excited, sat still and wait.<br /><br />The second update still 630MB.  ...<br /><br />And the then the third one is still 630MB. And that was the time I completely lost my patience.  I am the father of two kids, was video game fan for very long time, but for now I am really sorry but you are wasting my time.<br /><br />Are you kidding me?  Is it that hard to update your online digital download source?<br /><br />No wonder the whole gaming industry is losing customers that fast.	2015-08-10

If you don't, and this is your first audio listening equipment beyond some apple earbuds or 30 dollar earbuds/headphones, these will be fine.<br />TL;DR at the bottom if you just want a quick list.<br /><br />Construction is fine here, nothing felt wobbly or janky whatsoever. Solid stuff.<br /><br />Comfort is a mixed feeling for me. It felt really cheap with the earpads and head padding, it squeaks when you move and doesn't really offer a seal. I know it's going for less heat over long sessions, and while I appreciate that, I like a sealed sound for gaming. These will not become hot or make you sore, even with my large and thick glasses frames. The cheap feeling really puts me off, but I have to give credit where it's due, they are comfy enough.<br /><br />Sound.<br />Yikes.<br />So I installed and updated the thing, etc, so I know I was hearing it at it's best. It's not good.<br />There's no custom sound options, you just have 12 presets, 4 of those are not surround, leaving you with 8 options. 7 of these 8 options sound incredibly veiled (like listening with a pillow between your ears and the drivers), leaving me with one option I sorta found passable, Movie 2.<br />Movie 2 is super V shaped, like the actual letter itself. The trebles are so sharp simply reloading my gun in Halo and hearing the metal made me cringe. Bass is there, but not even boomy mind you, these thing's bass is not strong enough for a gaming headset IMO, gaming headsets should sound boomy and have loud thuds, it helps the immersion. This headset doesn't perform well enough with bass. It doesn't perform well with sound in any area to be honest, all the presets are awful.<br /><br />One last note, they are completely wireless with Xbox. It's awesome. They have to be wired up to the computer if you want to chat with your friends, and it doesn't support surround on the PC with the included stuff. At least not proper surround. If you're not chatting with friends, you can run a double sided 3.5mm  jack from your computer into the transmitter, and get wireless analog audio from your PC.<br /><br />All in all, while they are comfy and made well enough, if you are more familiar with high end audio, DO NOT buy this headset. Incredibly veiled with awful presets and a lack of bass.<br />If you're an average joe looking to go completely wireless from your xbox, these will be a great deal if you can snag them for under 180 bucks.it doesn't support surround on the PC with the included stuff.

They had this exact controller there (luckily for the same price as Amazon) and I picked one up.  Unlike other controllers I've seen here that have bad reviews, this one actually acts as a PRO controller, not a classic controller. I've been able to use this with games that only support the pro controller. It also has a rechargeable battery that lasts a good amount of time (I haven't actually ran it totally out yet) as well as the typical vibration force feedback. All the buttons work well and it doesn't feel as though it's going to fall apart in a month.  If I had to find some cons, it's that the controller is a bit lighter weight than you'd expect and the joysticks are a bit more stiff than those on the Wii U Gamepad (but not uncomfortably stiff). That being said, I am very happy with this controller and will likely buy another one. It's pretty hard to beat at half the price of the Nintendo branded pro controller.  EDIT (1/13/16): As it turns out, the games I tested it on can be played with the classic controller as well as the pro controller (see second edit below). So I am not 100% positive it acts as a PRO controller, however, I have yet to have any issues with this controller at all and it has worked with every game I own (see comments below for list of games I've used it on). The battery still holds a nice charge and the joysticks are holding up. No complaints.  EDIT (1/18/16): I have used this controller with New Super Mario Bors U which, as I understand it, does not support the classic controller. Thus confirming that this controller DOES act as a PRO controller, and not a classic controller.	2015-08-10

The controller I bought for use with my PC and the results I got were absolutely splendid, the controller felt ergonomically excellent, the buttons were in all the right places, response time was VERY fast and accurate. The bumpers did receive a pretty significant internal change that made the controller MUCH better, the bumpers are no longer as stiff as they were before, I feel comfortable just leaving my fingers in between the triggers and bumpers which allow me to push both at the same time with just my index fingers. All in all, if you're looking to use this on PC I cant recommend this controller enough... for most games, 2D games are fine using the controller's d-pad although I personally recommend using a dualshock controller for most comfortability, although if you's fine with the d-pad placement on the controller for 2D games then this controller is perfectly fine, I own a dualshock 4 myself so I'm covered for 2D and 3D games with both controllers but if you're looking for choosing between the dualshock 4 and this controller I can guarantee you that both perform practically identical, so the only thing standing between you and either controller are the $60 in your wallet and which button layout you prefer.<br /><br />Happy gaming :).	2015-08-10

This is really unfortunate because if you're using headphones in the first place it's probably because you don't want to make a lot of noise. It ought to be possible to set the mic gain high enough to be heard.<br /><br />Strangely the mic playback into the headset itself seems fine. Meaning that it plays your voice into the headphones while you're talking. So the mic can work but right now it isn't sending a strong signal out. If they update the software or there is a fix I'll adjust my review accordingly. Aside from the mic issue they sound good, feel comfortable and the fully wireless nature of the headphones is great.<br /><br />But if you're a serious gamer you need to be heard clearly.

I bought the Limited Edition Halo Vanguard GAEMS PGE about 2 years ago and it was one of the best investments I made while working in Afghanistan. This time around I decided to go with the m240 because they already established a good track record with the Vanguard. First impression. The M240 feels very durable. The stand on the back was a deciding factor when I decided to buy it. I was able to mount the monitor on the bottom of the top bunk. HDMI ports ensure that I have access to my PC and XBOX360.  The Good: Video frame rate is on point. I play a lot of fighting games that rely on single frame input windows and I can see a clear improvement in my ability to make the inputs. The thing that impress me most off all was the sound. This is coming from a guy that is a bit of an audiophile. I feel completely immersed in the game or movie I am watching.  The Bad: I wished the front of the monitor had an input button as well as a headphone jack. Contrast ratio is not very good and there is no option to control the backlight. That being said I haven’t tried it was a next gen console.	2015-08-10

"Once again, gaming's beloved ex-Naughty Dog marsupial has been hopping around from one development team to another, and this time's lucky group of ducklings happens to be Radical Entertainment. They're history with video games is rather mixed, consisting of games such as the  [[ASIN:B00004SVS1 \\\"edutainment\\\\\" Mario]] [[ASIN:B00004SVS2 games on NES]], as well [[ASIN:B00004SVWM the abominable Wayne's World game on the same console]], but in later years, they've received positive reception from handling licenses such as [[ASIN:B0007OSLAA The Incredible Hulk]] and [[ASIN:B000095ZH5 The Simpsons]]. How did they do with their first Crash game? Let's find out.<br /><br />While the [[ASIN:B000034DCF previous Crash]] [[ASIN:B00008NRM7 racing games]] had the same nonsensical story involving an alien that wants the characters to race for amusement, this game settles on a rather unappealing scientific genius trying to maintain a dangerous amusement park, but alas his Power Gems have been stolen. To get them back, Crash has to go and collect Power Crystals to activate jump pads to nab the missing Gems. Wait...I thought this was a racing game? Power Crystal collecting is involved in this?<br /><br />Believe it or not, Crash Tag Team Racing indeed does have a lot more than just arcade-esc kart-racing. The single-player adventure will have you move around in elaborate worlds that are not unlike those of [[ASIN:B0001CJEJU Crash Twinsanity]], albeit more compressed and confined than such. At first, I was slightly disappointed in how the game doesn't run at 60fps like Twinsanity does, but I've grown accustomed to it quick. The sense of humor, on the other hand, is what I still find flawed. Funny moments are not as common as before, as there are only 11 minutes of cutscene footage for the plot, and even then they don't focus on humor as much as they should. Meanwhile, the game encourages you to kill Crash yourself by various over-the-tops means labeled as \\\\\"Die-O-Ramas\\\\\", a collection of forced gags whose punchlines get detected the moment the game indicates you can trigger something with a suspicious object, therefore losing its comedic factor instantly. Also, please don't press any buttons during the loading screens unless you LOVE hearing burps and farts.<br /><br />Now with that out of the way, there is quite a lot to do in the amusement parks you visit. Scattered all around the place are Wumpa Coins and breakable boxes (as well as enemy penguins), allowing Crash to do his thing and collect bunches of coins by smashing stuff in sight. There are also gates that would take you to a track, and allow you to select a game mode for what kind of racing you want to do. There is the usual 3-lap racing, a 1-lap time trial, running into things, etc. There are even minigames you can play which can consist of stylized shooting galleries or penguin bowling. Power Crystals can be earned in several ways - You can win a race, place first in a different game mode or minigame, buy them off of NPCs, find them in the worlds themselves, or even go on fetch quests (which are usually for unlockable costumes and characters). The amount of variety there is to reaching your goal of gathering all these Crystals is actually pretty admirable, and the controls work nicely enough, if a tad loose. The bowling minigame is particularly my favorite (aside from racing of course) due to the constant change-up of lanes and further ability to control your ball.<br /><br />Of course, racing is the key gameplay in a game with \\\\\"Racing\\\\\" in the title; there are a good amount of tracks to choose from, but they are honestly not so inspired in comparison to Crash's earlier kart-racing ventures or even [[ASIN:B000F1TI98 Pac-Man World Rally]]. They're just...there, to serve their purpose as tracks and not that much more. The item selection is kind of lackluster, too, but fortunately, I find myself clashing with my opponents too much to care! Kart-clashing is the selling feature to the racing mechanics in this game, and that said, using a gun turret with types of ammo depending on the kart you hijack is addictive; it's always fun to witness a kart blow up after doing enough damage to it, and I can even place first while on an opponent's kart!<br /><br />Overall, while this definitely not a [[ASIN:B00009WAUD Mario Kart]] by any means, Crash Tag Team Racing does still manage to put together an interesting collage of gameplay concepts and ideas that mostly work out for the better in the end. Beneath the unnecessary bodily sounds and obnoxious voice for Crash (this is the first game where Crash gets to speak in gibberish thanks to Jess Harnell) is a game that is by no means perfect, but still shines enough for players to have a good time with it.id, using a gun turret with types of ammo depending on the kart you hijack is addictive; it's always fun to witness a kart blow up after doing enough damage to it, and I can even place first while on an opponent's kart!

It's absolutely identical.  The only change is the logo on the front.  One has a Pelican logo, the other says GameStop.  They both even say &#34;www.pdp.com&#34; on the back, so it's the  same manufacturer, same design, same quality, just the logo (and price) are different.  Don't spend $30 on a PS2 controller.<br /><br />Secondly, the controller isn't so great.  It's a cheaply built third-party controller like anything else.  Sadly, Amazon isn't selling it for cheap.<br /><br />The controller body is slightly smaller than the original Sony PS2 Dual Shock. If your hands get cramped after playing for a while on the original controller, this one is even worse.  The face buttons on the controller are inexplicably smaller as well, and they seem to be located closer to the analog sticks.  Your thumb will accidentally move the right stick all the time when you're actually trying to push the X or Square buttons.<br /><br />The face buttons are not very responsive.  I've had more than a few cases when the game didn't react unless I pressed the button as hard as possible.  I guess this is a symptom of the pressure-sensitive buttons that all PS2 controllers use, but some are better than others.<br /><br />The L2 and R2 shoulder buttons are also REALLY flimsy and wiggle around inside the socket a ton.  It looks like the buttons could fall right out, they rock back and forth at an angle so badly.  You would have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />Lastly, I bought this controller because it is advertised as having an &#34;Enhanced D-Pad.&#34;  I'd like to know what that is supposed to mean, because this d-pad is as bad as any controller I've used.  The diagonals are not precise whatsoever.  If you play any 2D games you will run or jump into things and die over and over.  If you press up or down the controller often interprets it as a left or right diagonal.  I think out of the big three console companies, only Nintendo got d-pads right.<br /><br />This controller is not sturdy or precise, and this is true with both versions of the controller I own.  Like I said, they are identical.	2015-08-10

I bought this one, instead of the one made specifically for the Xbox, because it is half the price. The one and only mod I needed to make was to the pedal plate. I did have to drill 2 holes in order to screw the pedals in place. Reading the questions and other reviews I was fully expecting to have to modify the wheel mount to make my wheel work( I have the Thrustmaster VG 458 Spyder for Xbox One), and there was no need. The two rubber pads on the &#34;clamp&#34; fit exactly on the crossbar, holding it firmly in place. The one and only complaint I have is that it needs to be a bit more stable on the bar that extends out where the wheel itself mounts. It tends to wobble a bit when driving vigorously. Overall, 5 out of 5, since almost no mod necessary for Xbox play and half the price of the Xbox specific stand.	2015-08-10

I'd say noise levels for the fan are medium. It's not quiet, but it's not distracting. What I like are the rubber feet that really grab the surface the unit is on. You don't want your PS4 tipping over or sliding off - and this will keep that from happening. Charger for the controllers works well. Solid, solid unit. Great investment.	2015-08-10

This lets you connect Xbox 360 controllers to you computer for use in video games. Some games will have built in Xbox 360 support and others you will have to go into the options to configure your controllers. It works great and is easy to set up, just plug it in and let the drivers install then sync the controllers you want to use(up to four controllers at once). You sync the controllers by pressing the button on the receiver and the small button on top of the Xbox 360 controller near the port which is between the lb and rb buttons. This receiver is a little light and seems like if stepped on it would break so you have to take care of it. The wireless range is pretty decent so you wont have to worry about being to far from it. It has a green light on it to show you when it is plugged in.	2015-08-10

It was really easy for her to learn and play on her own. The motions and controls for the game were simple and they show a small video example in the bottom corner of the screen demonstrating what the motion should look like when they are required to do a new move. Dora never &#34;dies&#34; in the game, which I appreciate for the age group to which this game is geared. I would highly recommend this game overall. The only con I can think of to mention is the pixelation of the game. I wish that it was formatted in high definition for better viewing and graphics, however for a 3/4yr old, that really is the least of her concerns.	2015-08-10

Against popular opinion, I have to rate this title highly. It is everything an NES game used to be and this is all it should be seen as. Other reviewers say that the graphics are crap, the audio is lofi and the mechanics are broken but I found none of this to be true. The game is incredibly hard but keeps you coming back for more. The graphics and sounds are exactly what you would find in a vintage platformer and the multi-genre spanning works wonderfully. If you rate this against other 3Ds games, then yes, it is not the best. but if you consider it to be a new classic then it holds up against mario bros. 1, Megaman, Wonderboy and Alex Kid.<br /><br />The game is so hard in fact that I tore my thumb nail, bloodied my elbow and lost my voice by the time I beat it but it was well worth it and I will be playing it again considering the New Game + mode. Asie fom the difficulty the game is actually quite forgiving. Continues and check points make this so. This game should not be overlooked for under ten bucks.	2015-08-10

I became a Turnip addict, constantly meeting up with people for big turnip sales, raking in those bells. It was fun designing the house, interacting with the NPCs, and doing all the activities with other people through WiFi. When this came out online handheld gaming was just starting to blow up, so it was pretty cool to be playing something like this at the time. I had four or five friends who had the NDS or NDS Lite, and we all played this game together. This is the kind of game you could pick up and play today and it would still be fun. I don't own a 3DS, but if I get one I'll be pulling this game out of my closet and playing it day one.	2015-08-10

I figured maybe that was just the one that came with it, so I bought a new and it has THE SAME PROBLEM. And I don't use capitalization without reason. Figure your s*** out microsoft.	2015-08-10

Well, this cartridge does not have that symbol. This is an older game and I told him maybe the symbol is fairly new and when this older game came out they weren't adding that symbol. Or mabye he's right, it is a knock-off. The game is shipped from China and took a long time to get here.  Not sure if the game is authentic or not. It worked well.	2015-08-10

This controller is a mixed bag...  One one hand it is bluetooth and the analog sticks are nice and it took no time to connect... But then there are the flaws...  The buttons do not feel good, the control pad is God awful, the back buttons are cheap, as are the triggers, and worst of all, there is a noticeable amount of input lag. I use it for a Gamepad when emulating without any other Bluetooth devices and the lag is just enough to make playing platformers like Mario and Metroid a chore.	2015-08-10

After less than a month of use, the headband had cracked in the center (I don't handle the headset roughly AT ALL). It's been three months and the headset is cracked in two other places - left and right sides. The comfort pad or whatever built into the headband is pulling away from the band. There is an ever-present buzzing via the headset itself, unless you turn the volume on it almost all the way down.  Having to reset the color each and every time the headset is powered up stinks (wanted it to match the color on my Logitech G600 mouse, but soon gave up).<br /><br />Recording quality has been fine, and audio quality has been decent as well. Pairing it with different devices has worked out smoothly.	2015-08-10

If you stare at a computer screen all day you should definitely consider trying these out.  The one thing is they have a yellow tint to them which I imagine helps with the eye strain but might take a little getting used to.	2015-08-10

It's truly a never-ending type of game because you can just play it to slaughter orcs, which is great if you've had a bad day.  I had to take off one star for three reasons:<br /><br />1)  There's too much needless collecting.  Completing the main storyline only gives you 50% of total game completion.  In order to get 100%, you need to collect all the artifacts and Ithildin, as well as complete all the hunting and survival challenges, weapons missions, and other side missions.  All of that is completely optional, and I didn't bother doing them all.  Really, all that stuff is for trophy nuts who are addicted to getting trophies.  I wish they made it mandatory to complete most of those side missions and/or get those collectibles in order to advance the main storyline, but you can easily complete the game without even doing one of the aforementioned tasks.<br /><br />2)  I should have bought the original, non-GOTY game.  The DLC is pretty useless.  Specifically, The Bright Lord campaign is WAY too difficult after the first two or three missions.  I don't know why they upped the difficulty so much.  Doesn't make sense to me, so I just filed my game into my CD case and called it a day.  As far as I'm concerned, once I beat the main crux or storyline of a game, that's it for me.  All DLC is just a cash cow for developers.<br /><br />and,<br /><br />3)  The game gets repetitive after a while.  Unless you enjoy slaughtering orcs if you've had a bad day or week, expect to not play this game again once you've already beaten it.<br /><br />4 stars.	2015-08-10

Graphics are superb and amazing on my 144hz LED monitor!<br />My you tube channel that shows the game play.  Bear in mind I recorded at a lesser frame rate and resolution so it wouldn't take ages to upload.<br />https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_nQjYOMkLlXAyRr1tRfdyQ/playlists<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great graphics!!! I'm running an 8GB Card so it can take all settings max on 1080p.<br />2. Fun style of play. Easy learning and feel.<br />3. World is huge and  I mean huge! They give you excellent modes of transportation. I barely use quick travel.<br />4. The story is a bit bizarre but once you get involved it's fun. I love stealth.<br />5. Customize game play. It lets you disable and enable a wide variety of options.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Night time is way to short! I like to do my jobs at night and its not very realistically dark like Far Cry 2 and it only lasts for around 10-15 minutes.<br />2. No weather affects unless you call wind a weather affect! One of my favorite thing was storms in Far Cry 2. This game, not one!<br />3. No multiple save options in campaign mode. Sometimes I like to save a new slot so I can go back later. Nope not this time.<br />4. No option to make it virtually impossible to beat. I like games that ramp up the difficulty. This only has 3 options, easy medium and hard. Where's infamous! When I get hit I want to get hit not feel like something annoying is shooting at me.<br />5. Check out the screen shot. It has some graphic issues but not much.<br /><br />All and all this game fun to play and has great game play but it's the little things that matter to me. I figured Ubisoft would at least put weather in the mix. The night affects being shortened really put me in a downer mode. Very disappointing with that. As being a long fan of the Far Cry series, I believe this was made mainly for graphics and not for the true Far Cry fans who enjoy the realism.<br /><br />If your looking for a visually stunning game then buy it. If your into more realism type of game, I would say buy it too because than your giving them money to make the next Far Cry hopefully more realistic all around. Either way is a win win for me:)<br /><br />***UPDATE*** 09-09-2015<br /><br />So I completed the game and went back and played Far Cry 3. Wow this game is a major upgrade compared to Far Cry 3. I changed my rating to 5 stars because of this. It's a lot more smoother and lot better graphics. Also it seems more realistic and has better stealth options. The pros outweigh the cons in this title based off of previous games.he next Far Cry hopefully more realistic all around. Either way is a win win for me:)   ***UPDATE*** 09-09-2015  So I completed the game and went back and played Far Cry 3. Wow this game is a major upgrade compared to Far Cry 3.

(Now that my dad bought the games, controllers, and hook-up cords separately)	Okay, I just want to say that I bought this just a little over a month ago. The first thing is that it works just fine. However, it does NOW. I have two major complaints about this console they sent me: The big one first - when I first ordered it, it said it would come with one controller and the cords to hook it up. But, when the UPS truck came to my house and dropped it off 3 days later, I opened the box and there was nothing inside but the console: no games, kinect, hard-drive, controllers, not even the power cord and HDMI cord! JUST the console! I ordered this a month ago, and my dad JUST bought all of the things to hook it up: two controllers, a power cord, an HDMI cord, and two games, Madden NFL 15 and Need For Speed: Shift. Now if it had come with those five things, this would be a four and a half-star review (I'd still be bummed about no hard-drive or kinect, but not too bummed because you can just buy those seperately, but this review is three-star because no seller should make their customers buy THAT much stuff seperately). My second complaint is that the version of this console I was gonna buy was for $72, but when I confirmed my purchase, it said i had spent $89! Now I only have $11 left on my $100 Amazon gift card my Grandma got me for Christmas,  and barely any of the other stuff I want to buy is under $13, so I have high hopes that she'll get me another one this upcoming Christmas. However, now that my dad has bought everything else, it works perfectly. My dad, despite being a big football fan, finds Madden NFL 15 very hard, and both him and my brother LOVE Need For Speed: Shift. One of the few things my brother's been doing the past few days is playing that game! Plus, for a best-selling high-tech video game console, $89 is actually a REALLY good deal compared to some  of the others on Amazon.  Overall, if you wan't an xbox 360, but have the money to buy all the other stuff it SHOULD come with seperately, get this!	2015-08-10

Two end prongs won't fit snugly into battery compartment. Must use tape to secure battery pack in otherwise it will fall out or you throw it across room. With it taped in it charges and eorks.

The enemies are paramilitary and not aliens, but the shooting mechanics are really good. The game runs very smooth. I liked the music overall. The graphics are good for the PS3 era. Ammunition pickups are usually plenty, and you get three guns for your character. The three other characters run by the computer are decent and do a lot of work. Each character has their own gun set but you can switch two of the guns if wanted. I just wish the games was longer, as it can be completed in about 10 hours.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, there are some enemies that if you shoot them in the back they take more damage. However, it turns out you can just shoot them anywhere and still damage them. So it really does not matter where you shoot them, the back just does more damage is all.	2015-08-10

So, you fight, level up, and craft gear, but you also farm and date everyone.&#34;<br />  &#34;That sounds weird but very much like your kind of game.&#34;<br />And he was right! Playing this game is all I do when I get home from work, so beware if you want to maintain any sense of productivity.<br /><br />The game allows for casual play if you just wanna chill, meet the characters, dress in silly costume combos, and meander through the dungeons. But you can also go full out, gear up, customize, tame the best monsters, and wipe everything. Overall I think there's something for everyone.<br /><br />You like art?<br />  - There are small cut scenes for important moments, like main character reveals, in a crisp, anime style. They're replayable from a spot in the basement of your house, in case you (god forbid) weren't paying attention the first time.<br />  - You can also see certain outfits and headgear on your character as you run around the game world. Have fun pairing pumpkin heads with sheep costumes! The core appearance of your main character is set though.<br />  - Give villagers headgear to see them potentially wear it while walking around the game world.<br /><br />Are the characters interesting?<br />  - Get to know them through random events (just like real life!) that expand upon personalities and histories of NPCs, and unlock story elements.<br />  - Get super close to the eligible bachelors/bachelorettes and date all at once without penalty, unlocking more personal dialogue, and enabling you to make an educated choice in who to marry.<br />  - Play as a male or female, or both! There are a couple save slots available.<br />  - Each character has a unique voice that speaks relevant sounds or full sentences depending on the discussed topic. This is in English.<br /><br />I want to fight!<br />  - Each weapon category (I think there are 7 weapon types?) has tons of options within, and enhancing them with items allows for amazing optimization.<br />  - Craft mass amounts of armor, accessories, and more to uniquely fit your play style.<br />  - Bring two NPCs at a time to dungeons for extra help, and enlist the aid of monsters by taming them (and keeping them on your farm for free recipe ingredients).<br /><br />I prefer Harvest Moon elements...<br />  - Craft increasingly helpful farm tools to get more done in less time.<br />  - Tame and care for monsters of your choice, some of which produce helpful ingredients to use in crafting.<br />  - Expand your farm size or locate other patches of farmable land around the map for extra room.<br />  - Spend &#34;Prince/Princess&#34; points to develop the town, add shops, and attract more tourists.	2015-08-10

You have been warned)	This game is pretty okay. Except for these 2 reasons. #1 THE GRAPHICS. The graphics are so bad for a game that comes from 2006. The PS2 graphics have better then this! Ubisoft, what were you thinking? If you are going to make a game at least try to have realistic graphics!!! Just saying. #2 YOU CANT PLAY ONLINE. The racing and the designing on the cars is good. But the fact that you cant play online stinks!!! Most games let you play online with REAL people. Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and even DS let's you play online games. But not for this one. The graphics may not be as good which is okay but the fact that you can't play online is terrible. That's my review. Thanks for reading. Ubisoft could do a better job.

The combat mechanics are clunky (basically a copy of Dragon Age) and do little to differentiate the various skills/powers available. Graphics show a ton of clipping and poor collision detection. If your idea of combat is essentially pausing the game every few seconds, you might like it. But overall I found it underwhelming. Companion powers are at best tacked on, such as Mors' dog, and add very little to the game. Many of the dialog choices are false choices and actually do nothing to change the way the game progresses. In all, a rather poor game adaptation of a wildly popular show.	2015-08-10

I absolutely LOVED the high speed high intensity Tenkaichi 3 and I was expecting a similar product in terms of fighting style and controls and I PERSONALLY was let down. The controls feel too mechanical and stiff for my preference. I've been watching a lot of Burst Limit gameplay and I think it suites my taste a lot more in the direction of high intensity high focus gameplay	2015-08-10

My hands usual hurt after using my 3DS for about an hour, but the case really helps with that. It also allows the case to rest parallel to the surface it is placed on, which seems trivial, but is a nice bonus.<br /><br />4 stars because I only use the bottom half of the case, as the top half makes the device feel very top heavy and makes it sort of difficult to hold upright.	2015-08-10

I wasn't a huge fan of the Dead Island games but some friends talked me into picking this one up to try the co-op. The graphics are not really next gen but everything else is well done and fun. The free running controls are perfect and drop kicking zombies off of roof tops or into spikes continues to be fun. Night time in the game is tense as are climbing the antenna towers for missions.

I'm not a gamer, but wanted to get a system for my young stepson to play and something I could use as well.  The Kinect seemed like a great option because I could do Zumba or dancing, and my stepson and his father can play games that get them moving.  I'm very glad XBOX made it easy for us to use their system.<br />I will say though, that the games included came in packaging in Spanish.  I didn't notice right away because when you set up the system it allows you to select your language, and once you choose English, if you put the game in, it plays in English and all the tutorials are in English.  Didn't bother us at all, but if the packaging matters to you, well, there you have it.	2015-08-10

The first one I believe got made to look more like the second installment visually.  These games are quite good first person shooters. The post apocalyptic vibe is very good.  They can be a little unclear on where to go at times and I did check videos to see where to go sometimes, but not a huge issue. Just kills flow for me personally sometimes.  Environments and art style is great.  The shooting action is great and you get several standard choices but the customisation fleshes things out more with the weapons. Definately a package worth picking up and experiencing overall.	2015-08-10

With the reviews I was expecting it to be much worse than it was.  When I had seen previews it looked very impressive.  I held off because of the reviews. This game ended up being one of my favorite open world games.  Just be aware that it doesnt start off great.  You start off extremely weak and fighting enemies felt s***ty to me at first.  Your weapons break fast and hardly hurt the guys.  However you dont lose progress when you die. You just respawn at a farther location. When you come back, whoever you killed or injured remains that way. So eventually I grinded out all the enemies through many deaths. That part was not fun to me.  However, several hours into the game you do get alot stronger, with upgrades and better weapons and then the game becomes awesome.    The two main cities you explore in the game are extremely detailed and well done. The mobility and movement is some of the best ive seen. You can climb and jump rooftops easily once you get into the rhythym. That was another thing that took a few hours to get into a flow with.    The survival vibe and atmposphere was a great and unique experience.  I highly reccomend picking this game up and giving it some time. Definately dont judge by the first few hours. Spend some time with it, grind out the beginning and then it may really grow on you as it did for me.	2015-08-10

However, for me personally and other FPS die-hards out there, we do enjoy a challenging FPS every now and then. Some are just no challenge even on hardest difficulty, so this is nice and refreshing. The graphics are great, story is fiction and I enjoyed it. Guns are great on this game, controls are good, very similar to the Call Of Duty series. Overall this game is great, where it falls short is the online servers are down, you can still run private matches, but without an online pass (Which most people don't have because they buy used games) you can't even get online experience to level up. So I strongly dislike all Online pass required games, and with this one in particular, it has no public servers, so 2 things bring it down to an average score for me, however a great single player experience.	2015-08-10

LOVE LOVE LOVE Little Big Planet games! I waited forever for this to come down in price so I could afford it! They have all been fun so far and this one is showing a lot of promise as well. I say that this is a good medium-level nerd type of game. By that I mean that I like lots of nerdy things including video games but that I am not into FPS'ers or many of the MMPORG games either so I consider myself a medium-level dork!<br /><br /> I was disappointed that I can not import all of the myriad characters/skins/etc that I purchased from LBP1 and 2. I really think this needs to be remedied as I know personally I put a decent chunk of money into all of the added content packs that would come out especially when I wasn't sure if there was going to be a third game so I wanted to be able to extend my play-time as long as I could. I am only a few levels in so I shall return for an update after we have played with it some more. I heard that you no longer do cooperative playing online either which is a big of a bummer as well but also sounds like an issue that could be tweaked if they really wanted to. All-in-all a great game from a good developer that I hope to see more from in the future!	2015-08-10

Glad i finally broke down and bought this product.  I've been playing Mario Golf for about three rounds straight with no hand problems whatsoever.  I have pretty good size male hands and some games were just painful to play for any length of time; besides Mario Golf, Kid Icarus is one that quickly comes to mind.  It is true that the stylus will not be accessible.  A minor flaw for the amount of relief given.  I was worried about having to remove this grip when putting it back in my case.  Other reviewers had problems.  There is no problem!!  Just use a standard credit card and gently slide it between the two outside tabs and slightly pry up.  It literally takes 5 seconds or less and it won't scar up your 3ds horribly either.  enjoy!	2015-08-10

(yes i know you can find higher capacity aaa batteries but the bottom line is smaller storage space is smaller charge capacity, you could argue that you can find even large capacity AA batteries). whats puzzling about this choice is that usually smaller batteries are selected to save space, but the battery compartment here actually *wastes* internal space by leaving an empty gap that *almost* enough for a 4th aaa battery, but it does not use it. seems they should have made internals slightly larger to accommodate an additional aaa battery, or used the same space to accommodate 3 aa. this part of the review did not affect the score. it was just an observation on a strange design choice. the score is based on terrible ergonomics and lacking function in pc gaming.	2015-08-10

I haven't wrote any game review for long time, but this one is something that I must do. I play AC1 in PS3 and that was it; the reason is I was doing the same missions and side jobs all day long, and I got tired of. However, since this game is under $20, so I have nothing to play at this point..so I gave it a shot. The control was kinda tricky to pick up in the first hour, and I think it's because I haven't played AC series for long, so I need a little bit time to pick. Something that's taking into it is the story. I like how this games gives me a prelude and then get into the real thing after two hours later. Yup, I do get stocked sometimes, so I go to YouTube to find a quick solution..but so far that I've only done it once. This game does make you thinking...but it won't suck up all your brain. Overall, this is a very interesting game and I'm going to spend at least an hour a day to explore the story.	2015-08-10

I have checked everywhere available, and there are no extension cables for these controllers. So, you are stuck with what you get here.<br /><br />Also, a major gaff in design, is the power & reset buttons.<br /><br />They are set in the opposite positions of where they should be --- literally, pressing the power button down, it depresses the way the reset button should, and the system shuts off. The reset button clicks when pressed, and stays in place --- I actually had to place a penny on the power button and tape it down in order to play a game, which only held for a short while before coming undone and the power shutting off.<br /><br />My suggestion is stay away from this thing and go with another system that has a similar function --- there are others out there that play multi latform cartridge based games --- this one is not a good option.	2015-08-10

The first CL4P-TP was DOA. Somehow predicable for a Claptrap :-) we contacted the robot help line ( yeah I get to finally say that) and they were very responsive by phone and email. Quick questions, a prompt FEDEX shipping label. Daily updates on status, and another Clappy FEDEXed back in all his glory. Chasing the dog. As I have no stairs, he's pretty happy. Hard surface work better than carpet, of course it is quite funny to watch him crash and burn a few times. I already had all the games, I went for the Hmadsome Jack collection for the Clap Trap robot. Alas the only other issue was an old cellphone was not good enough, i had considerable frustration getting the app, so it became the excuse to upgrade. A two year old version of. Samsung fixed the problem, quick download, works as advertised. Idea Planet who supplies the claptrap was &#34;A # 1&#34; .  In the spirt of the character, I was able to keep my sense of humor about the app and malfunction. In the end, a few weeks later my toy is well behaved. Obvious a labor of love product.

I'm a huge fan of space flight games like Elite:Dangerous, Jumpgate, Vendetta Online, Starport Gemini and so on, but I didn't want to dish out hundreds for the immersion a simple throttle + joystick combo can offer. Long story short: I should have.<br /><br />For a budget HOTAS this one of very few options on the market, which is a huge shame. The throttle stick isn't terrible and would work fine on its own (if you don't mind a little inaccuracy around the &#34;catch&#34; zone when trying to fine tune your thrust for landings), but the joystick is simply awful, with massive deadzones on every axis and very inconsistent, cheap-feeling tension throughout the movement ranges. For a game like Elite: Dangerous, precise yaw control is crucial for micro-adjusting your aim when you've got an enemy in the crosshairs, and the awkward tension of this joystick's yaw axis combined with its large deadzone will leave you swinging dramatically to the left and right of your target. Beyond the poor movement and feel of the stick, the cheap plastic makes a groaning/squeaking sound that I wasn't able to ignore, though I imagine this might have gradually improved if I had taken the time to break in the stick and wear down whatever component was causing the sound.<br /><br />If none of the above deters you, then congrats! Performance aside, the entire unit feels comfortable to hold and the button placement feels fine, if perhaps a bit sparse. I was able to compensate for the lack of buttons by programming multiple button presses simultaneously, effectively grouping commands by treating the buttons on the throttle stick like &#34;shift,&#34; &#34;alt,&#34; &#34;control&#34; and so on. I found that the cable between the two sticks was long enough to let me rest each stick comfortably at shoulder width, but not long enough to allow my keyboard to fit between them, which made my overall setup pretty awkward and cumbersome. I tried playing with both halves of the unit connected, but I felt cramped and contorted, so I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />If you simply MUST play with a HOTAS, but you're shopping on a budget and you don't mind trying to aim and steer as though you're riddled with Parkinson's, then go ahead and throw money at this stick. Otherwise, keep shopping around. I returned this product and eventually settled on a dual-joystick setup for about the same price that I much prefer.to hold and the button placement feels fine, if perhaps a bit sparse.

Keyword CHALLENGES. These are not the actual full games. Not even close. There is a reverse version of super mario bros with luigi but thats the most complete game in the package. Everything else is challenges based on classic games.<br /><br />I got this knowing that. I have all the old games preserved on emulation on a pc. So I wasnt looking for a compilation disc.  This disc includes Two compilation games. NES Remix 1 and NES Remix 2.  Both were released as downloads on the nintendo store.  Each game has a main campaign type of path that is beatable with brief ending scenes.  Once those are completed you have a third set of bonus levels. These are just more of the same types of levels but sometimes include challenges from different games.  Aside from the main campaign paths you have many games that each have thier own sets of challenges. You get ratings in each challenge from 1 to 3 stars.  The stars you unlock are what you use to unlock more stages in the main campaign.  Its very forgiving and you dont have to beat everything to unlock all the main levels.<br /><br />Game is very addictive though. Some challenges can be a little tricky at first.  For someone who has played through so many games in the last nearly 3 decades, it was too easy overall. That was my only issue. Thats not so much a flaw as a personal perspective though. Everyone is different.  There was some challenge though in some parts but most of it I went through very quickly.  There is still alot of content though and it offers hours of gameplay with that nostalgic vibe. Presentation is great too.	2015-08-10

Would have been 5 stars if they hadn't left the box where the mouse pad was stored open and left it to bend half of the pad. Don't know if i can get rid of the bent area, look permanent. I was pretty excited but now i don't think I want it anymore, considering i have to put something heavy on top of the bent area to keep it down, which limits the space i have to move around. Good mouse pad though, has a great feel and its pretty thick.	2015-08-10

It is fast paced, simple, and has tons of cool and VERY attractive male and female characters. The Fatalities are extremely kickass and gruesome, and the game looks absolutely amazing.<br /><br />I love the Klassic Tower, and I watched a relative of mine play the full story. The game has a super good story that ends happily. I love everything about this game. If you wanna play a great fighting game, then I highly recommend that you play Mortal Kombat X.	2015-08-10

So for me the only thing that could've brought this down from 5 stars is bluetooth lag, of which there is absolutely none. Totally seamless, virtually no setup was needed just set it in pairing mode like any other bluetooth device.<br /><br />Since I don't have the console or a dedicated charger, had to find alternative means to charge it, and I found I can't use a wall charger, I have to charge it from my laptop USB port (which I googled and found other people saying the same thing).<br /><br />If you're looking for a controller with bluetooth to game on your laptop, this is a great one.	2015-08-10
