At first glance this cable seems better then the competition. However if you have your Genesis plugged into a good sound system you'll notice right away that something isn't right. With my particular cable the right audio jack causes the sound to become muffled. Also the bass cuts out all together. Unplug the right audio jack and the bass returns. So for now I'm going to have to use my Model 1 Genesis.<br /><br />I'm returning this AV cable right away.<br /><br />Edit: This is  a message to HDE. I'm not sure if you actually manufacture this product or just sell it. But after testing the pin-outs on the socket, it seems you have the right audio channel wired to the mono signal, which would explain the muffled sound. One my other AV cable the left and right audio channels are correctly wired to their respective pins resulting in much better sound. I looked up the pin-out diagram for the model 2 Genesis and began testing each pin to make sure they were all wired correctly. It would seem just the right audio channel was wired incorrectly. Picture quality however is very good.	2015-08-30

In his place, the evil vizier Jaffar takes control and plans to marry the Princess and kill the Sultan should he dare to return. However the Princess despises Jaffar and has fallen in love with a mysterious traveler. Knowing this young man will get in his way, Jaffar has him arrested and thrown into the deepest dungeon in the palace. He then gives the Princess an ultimatum, either marry Jaffar or die within the hour. Meanwhile, the young man has broken his bonds and must now race to the top of the palace to free the Princess before time runs out.<br /><br />Prince of Persia was ported to numerous other computers and consoles before this version, and while there are some distinguishing features, little has changed, however this is not necessarily a bad thing as Prince of Persia was and remains a fantastic platforming experience. Having been one of the first true attempts at realistic platforming, the controls definitely take considerable time to get used to. The game has you navigate a series of mazes with death traps and swordsmen at nearly every corner. The game places an emphasis on caution as running head on into any problem is a fast way to die. Despite this focus on taking things slowly, the ever present countdown is a constant reminder that you have to get moving. It is also important to note that, while you can retry a level as much as you want, starting over a level after death does not restart the countdown. Although the control may seem rough and difficult when you first play the game, after you are used to how the character moves and interacts with his surroundings the game becomes very fun.<br /><br />Most versions of this game tend to be the same, but there are a few that offer unique features. This version has some additions that add to the value and one that may turn some off. The key feature here is unique graphics. Instead of simply being a port of the Genesis version's graphics, the Sega CD version has it's own designs for the player and enemy sprites, as well as new variations on the backgrounds. however, although it's a nice touch, the graphics aren't quite as good as the Genesis version or as varied as the SNES version, which is a little disappointing for the Sega CD. Next is a feature very few versions of the game included, a full soundtrack. However, it is not very extensive. There are two tracks you will hear primarily throughout the game with a few fanfares here and there, but besides them there are a some tracks for the menus and cut scenes. And that brings us to the cut scenes. At the opening and ending of the game are cut scenes that tell the story. However, they have very little in the way of animation and the voice acting is what you'd expect from early nineties anime dubs. The one other feature that puts this version above the other console ports is the ability to save your game. Almost every console version requires passwords to keep your progress, but this version allows you to use the system's internal memory to save at the start of each level. This will allow you to shave off some time and beat the game as fast as you can.<br /><br />Overall, the package is fairly solid. It's not necessarily the preferred version of Prince of Persia, but it has enough to stand out among the numerous ports. If you have a Sega CD ans want to expand your collection a bit, it's worth getting.to the value and one that may turn some off. The key feature here is unique graphics.

I bought this game for the Road to Glory mode pretty much solely and so far it's been a lot of fun, I've played the 2013 version as a quarter back and maybe I suck, but even on easy mode I struggled with it and it just wasn't much fun, on this 2011 version I switched over to a half back for road to glory and have had a lot more fun playing the game.  Add in the Erin and Kirk segments that are semi-repetitive but still add a nice touch which the 2013 versions didn't have and I am liking this 2011 Road to Glory version the best of all the NCAA's I've played out of 05, 06, 08, and 13.  If you want something that's more challenging probably try a newer version but if you want something that's semi-updated to this century and just provides some fun while rofl stomping the computer  to ridiculous scores, this is definitely the game for you and I got exactly what I was looking for in this game.  Oh one side thing the servers for this game have been taken offline so if your looking for any sort of online content or anything for it, you wont find any, but that's not really a concern for me.	2015-08-30

This device gets the job done, but it isn't great. I knew this however when purchasing the item from other reviewers so I bumped my review up from a 3 to a 4. My real reason for purchasing this item over others was that I already had the same model charging station for my PS4 (and love it!). As for the xbox one model, the only thing holding your controller on the base is gravity. And as we all know, sometimes gravity can be a finicky beast. Also the batteries supplied do not contain as much of a charge as the official rechargeable batteries from Microsoft.<br /><br />All in all however, the device serves its purpose fine so long as you recognize it's faults. I have placed mine in an area that the controllers are not likely to get knocked off the charger but yet it's close enough for me to grab a spare controller if I need one. The indicator lights on the charge station are also nice.	2015-08-30

When I open a product, I expect it to start working in 60 seconds. Just like my iPad.<br /><br />It has been over 24 hours.

What an awful experience on my birthday! See attached picture.<br /><br />First it took 3 hours just to start the Xbox One. Very unhappy that it took 3 painful hours to get to the welcome screen. Microsoft, is this cool? (Starting the console required a mandatory ~300 MB system update. I have a ~105 Mbps high-speed cable internet line from Comcast. Xbox one has a wired connection. Xbox is receiving internet speed between of 80 - 90 Mbps. Although the game file is downloading at about ~1 Mbps)<br /><br />Dear Microsoft Product Managers - here is a challenge for you. When a customer starts their Xbox One they should be able to begin using it in 60 seconds or less. If it takes several days to start using their game console then Steve Jobs is right about your sense of taste. And from my experience over the last 24 hours - a lack of respect for your customer's emotions.<br /><br />Folks, wish me happy birthday!	2015-08-30

I can't speak for how well the fan works, to be honest it's not really the reason I bought this. But as far as saving space goes this thing is great. The system doesn't really lock into place, but so long as you don't fall into your tv stand (or wherever you keep your PS4) you should be okay. The fan is a little bit noisy if you're sitting in a quiet room, but if you're mid game or watching something on your Playstation it's not really that noticeable. However, they kindly help you with any issues you might have with that by adding a stop button that basically toggles the fans on and off. For the price, as just a stand and charger it's a no-brainer, while the fans seem to be just wishful thinking, it's something I'll let myself believe really works for everything else I am getting in this stand.	2015-08-30

You have to trudge through a lot of other games to unlock it though.<br /><br />Pros - lots of games with different levels of complexity.  Would be great for a kid to revisit as they grew.  Rules for all games are fairly well written, if brief.  Loads quickly and remembers last game played.<br /><br />Cons - computer players are terrible.  DO NOT BUY THIS FOR SOLO PLAY!  The computer is either way too easy or impossibly skilled depending on which game you are playing.  Poker based games are ruined by a lack of betting strategy.  Games with four or more players have crowded graphics and get laggy.<br /><br />Still pleased overall with the variety and a chance to learn new games.	2015-08-30

The art in general is very nice and the artbook  has some great images in it. The soundtrack is good, nowhere near one of my favourites, but definitely good.<br />If I had one gripe with the game it's that the boss fights that Iv'e faced at the point of writing this are tedious, without anything to keep the player interested in the fight while they slog through the large amount of health and possible multiple forms the bosses have.<br /><br />For anyone without an American PS4, be aware that the DLC may not work for you, it didn't work on my Irish console so just keep that in mind.<br /><br />As far as packaging and delivery go, the game arrived earlier than was expected, fully packaged and with everything listed on the page, more than satisfactory.	2015-08-30

A great entry into the interactive fiction genre on playstation. Like Heavy Rain before it, Until Dawn is a unique experience that I'd recommend anyone give a try. It's a healthy 10-12 hour length to complete, but it's filled with replayability as you can make new decisions that dramatically alter the narrative. Even if you aren't a huge horror fan, I say still give it a shot. From the atmospheric graphics and sound, to the multiple character driven narrative, I think the developer nailed what they set out to achieve.	2015-08-30

We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night.	2015-08-30

Not a bid deal, you can still play for many hours (I'd say at least 6 on a full charge, maybe longer, I never counted).  Other than that, it looks, feels and functions just like the real thing and is identical in every way except it says &#34;P3&#34; on the center button instead of the official PS3 logo.  The joysticks have a nice rubber grip too like the real controller.  My 3 year old loves it and will only play with this controller now.  He has used it daily for about a week playing various LEGO games with no issues at all.  I don't know if the rumble/vibrate function works or not, as I have only used the controller myself very briefly, but for this price who cares.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the controller will turn off automatically if you don't use it after a certain (and fairly short) period of time.  For example, if you are watching a movie on Netflix or something where you wouldn't be pushing buttons on the controller it will turn off, which is kind of annoying because you need to push the ps3 button to turn it back on before you can pause the movie, but overall this is a probably a good feature because it saves battery life and you can just fall asleep or walk away and it will turn off on its own.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this if you need an extra controller.  It is not worth paying over 3 times the price for an official Sony controller when the only real difference seems to be a longer battery life.  I was skeptical about buying a generic controller, but this one from USPRO works great so far and I'm very pleased.	2015-08-30

We have all of the consoles but our 1.0 and 2.0 are both Xbox 360. The Playstation saga bundle we decided to change to because of the benefits in this bundle. All of our characters and play sets from previous games that we used exclusively on 360 work well on this game so no worries there. It just pops up that you have registered the figure on a previous game and asks if you want to add it. The picture is upgraded and looks crisp on 1080 p. My husband and daughter have been playing for 2 hours in the new toy box going through different good guys, bad guys, and vehicles. We bought the toy box expansion and they have not even started it yet. Having so much fun in the toy box. You can play Disney radio music (may use Internet?) streaming music. The toy box comes with a dispenser that gives you multiple cars, scenes from places like gravity falls wreck it Ralph, and good guys and bad guys. Minnie Mouse is a huge hit because she skips around and uses her purse(disclaimer we bought Minnie, Mickey, Olaf, and the inside out characters they do not come with this bundle). We did not preorder so the toy box takeover expansion was an extra 20.99.<br />This set comes with 3.0 software<br />characters:<br />Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Boba Fett<br />Twilight of the Republic play set piece<br />Rise against the Empire play set piece<br />3 web codes-starter pack, rise against the empire, and Boba Fett<br />1 Disney infinity base (we now have 3)<br />I was unsure of upgrading but it was worth it. It is hard to not say too much. I do not want to spoil anything for anyone. We have had so much fun exploring it.	2015-08-30

If your a veteran Gear player I suggest you get this ASAP, finding matches very quickly no matter what hour of the day  ***UPDATE 1/2/16***  I was able to download Gears 1-3 and Gears Judgement which was nice (if you got the chance to play this any day in 2015, you'll be able to download all for free, Xbox will send you the codes) The nice part is that all the maps are for free (DO MOT BUY THEM WHEN SAYS NEEDS TO BE DOWNLOADED TO PLAY RANKED OR UNRANKED) Go to manage game on each one, and it'll show the maps that are ready to install and for free! =)  Even if you wasn't able to play in 2015, it's still a good deal to play GoW 1 remastered, GameStop brand new 40 dollars, but right now Amazon has new copies for 25 bucks wich is an amazing deal!	2015-08-30

Several of the adventures are cleverly set to music and the boys absolutely love them - play them over and over, even after high scoring.  I have to admit all the adventures are entertaining to watch and I like the music too.  The graphics are fantastic and there is an enormous amount of variety in every aspect of the game: characters, situations, background designs, things to collect, rewards, etc.  The boys even found ways to bash each other and the creatures, which gets them laughing and jumping.

This PC gaming mouse is good solution for the everyday computer user or gamer. The mouse features two back and forward buttons on the left side of the device, as well as colorful lights that change every 4-5 seconds. I will go over some basic information regarding if this computer mouse is right for you.<br /><br />This product is for you if:<br />- You are looking for a USB wired, laser mouse.<br />- You don't mind the materials that the mouse consists of. For example, the &#34;outside shell&#34; of the mouse is most likely a type of plastic, although I'm not entirely sure.<br />- You wan't a light-up, color changing mouse.<br />- You plan on, or ensure, that you have a valid surface to utilize the mouse on. A preferred surface would be a manufactured mouse pad.<br /><br />This product is not for you if:<br />- You are seeking a durable and sturdy mouse.<br />- You are looking for a wireless mouse. (This product is wired)<br />- You want very basic features. This includes no extra buttons on the side or top, just the traditional left/right click buttons and scroll wheel.<br /><br />Although these are just things I recommend keeping in mind, one thing I wish to state is that this mouse is very fragile. If you plan on purchasing this product, please ensure that proper precautions are taken to help protect the device from braking or being damaged.<br /><br />Design:<br />Another aspect that makes this mouse interesting is the unique USB jack design. The frame that surrounds the actual USB jack(not the cord) appears as if it matches the theme of the mouse itself. In addition to that, the device appears both very smooth, but also maintains a slightly sharp and sleek design. The sides, corners, and top of the gaming mouse consist of white streaks by which allow the colorful lights to shine through. The light colors change every 4-5 seconds(as previously stated) and transition as follows: Red&#62;Green&#62;Orange&#62;Light Green&#62;White&#62;Blue&#62;Purple&#62;Pink, and the cycle continues. Please note that the color cycle as mentioned is not correct in terms of order.<br /><br />Durability & Materials:<br />Overall, the device looks and feels as if it could brake and suffer damage quite easily. This product isn't made of high end material, therefor I highly suggest that all buyers be cautious with the way they use this device and take proper care of it. If you are careful enough, this computer mouse will last a long time. If this device isn't treated properly, it may likely brake very soon.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />In a 4/5 rating, I would recommend this gaming mouse to all desktop/laptop users who want a few extra built-in features but also plan on keeping it in a safe place. As for consumers looking for a high end computer mouse, I wouldn't necessarily suggest this product to them. In conclusion, this PC gaming, USB wired, laser mouse is a good and out of the ordinary device.the cycle continues.

I suppose the problem of Sony Santa Monica pumping out so many God of War titles is clearly present in this game; they put so much story and mythos into the other games, that there was nothing left for this game. It's hollow and feels spiritless. Where GoW I, II, (and half of) III were soaked in story and oozed frustration, rage, sorrow, regret, loss, and sadness, &#34;Ascension&#34; is just simply going through the motions (never played the PSP games, although I'm sure they were better than this). You're Kratos. You rage. You smash people. Game end.<br />The enemies this time were the lamest I have ever seen. These are mostly the same enemies, but now they have become either &#34;elementals&#34; or use elements in their attacks. Also, why would the medusa's now change their look, when they were set -in stone- (ha, ha, yeah ok) before hand? Why give those insufferable Talos elemental attacks now, when this was a backstory? Why the hell is Ganesha in Greece and so pissed off at me?! Why is this green stiletto-wearing woman from Cirque du Freak spitting poison at me?!...AND what is that hand creature? Where is that in Greek mythology?<br />This game focused more on face-to-face combat with bosses, instead of the interesting and cool ways to take them down. So you're sitting there for up to thirty minutes to take down two people. Ridiculous. It's not a challenge, it's lazy writing and gaming.<br />Also, the narration in this game is barely if ever present. Kratos is unlike himself not yelling at things every other scene. With him silent, it really becomes half-hearted and something akin to just playing with toys.<br />The Fates are more annoying than they are daunting. The boss battles with them are again, some of the lamest I have seen in a long time. Half the time you want to just smack them away like an pesky fly, instead of &#34;...Oh holy...I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT?!&#34;<br />While this game does have beautiful scenery and you're fighting alongside some of the best hits of God of War's soundtrack, this is merely Kratos with so many colors he looks like he's at a techno rave. Kratos is given elements for his weapons, but they serve no real purpose except for minor gimmicks to temporarily halt the enemies. You don't even really need them, as most bosses only respond to non-magical attacks and just actual blade hits.<br />By the time the most awesome battle comes, the game is over in less than a few minutes. A giant and epic fight, reduced to a few quick button timed events. Tragic.<br />This is proof they only made this game for more money. Again, lazy writing and game-making.<br />Borrow it, don't buy it. The spirit is completely gone.its of God of War's soundtrack, this is merely Kratos with so many colors he looks like he's at a techno rave.

The game plays just as smooth as a console entry (minus getting off the board). The framerate occasionally hiccups a little bit but it definitely makes due with what it's given. The game has 7 levels, which seemed short but they're accessible in-game so you don't have to access the pause menu. There's no create-a-park so the 7 levels get stale after awhile, and the create-a-skater is bare bones which hurts the replay value. My biggest knock is the unbelievably short story mode which a seasoned fan could get through in a couple hours. They did add a classic mode as well which helps the replayability. One neat thing they added is creating your own deck and grafitti tags with the touchscreen and recording your own sounds that play when you bail, use a special, etc. (This is optional). Overall this is a surprisingly solid entry in the Tony Hawk series that stays true to the gameplay we're used to on consoles. For the greatest portable Tony Hawk, play Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Remix on PSP. If DS or 3DS is your only option, buy this one as it's the best Tony Hawk game for the systems.	2015-08-30

I always played game like star wars Battlefront 2 or jak 3 on it. Sony needed to do a little more to the PS 3. If there was a way to get all my games and data for it back, I would seriously do it.

The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.

Are you a gamer with sweaty hands? Do you play seriously/competitively and need more granular control so you can pwn n00bz and howl &#34;HEADSHOT!&#34; loud enough to wake the baby? If the answer to either or both questions is &#34;yes,&#34; buy these and game on. If you only play occasionally, these still improve feel and control enough to be noticeable and well worth the price of admission. They may not make you a better gamer, but they'll make you a more comfortable one.<br /><br />I've been using them for nearly a year now and they completely solved the hand and wrist pain I used to get from my thumbs slipping around on the analog sticks during extended sessions (4+ hours). Compared to the cost of treating a repetitive strain injury, these things are basically free. As others have mentioned, the stock rubber covering on the PS4's analog sticks is also somewhat notorious for disintegrating, so these are a nice bit of insurance for your controllers and your body.	2015-08-30

I purchased the Nyko Databank for PS4 awhile back so I could increase the amount of storage space on it for the hard drive I chose to use a Seagate 4TB SSHD SATA 6Gb/s Cache 3.5-inch drive make sure to use a computer to reformat the drive to Ex fat using a computer not your PS4 or you'll crash the system. On the box it says to use a hard drive with 2TB or less because the firmware won't support anything bigger than 2TB it will support up to a 4TB SSD the only thing is you can't use rest mode at least until they update the firmware. Before you turn on your PS4 to use the new drive you need to get a flash drive with 1GB of storage or greater go online to www.playstaion.com and download the latest software update and then put your PS4 into safe mode to do that hold down the power button on the system until you hear two beeps once in safe mode put the flash drive into one of the slots on the console then on the menu that comes up select the last option this will erase everything that you have done its worth it in the end re initialize the system set it all up again the way you had it	2015-08-30

Bass is incredible and it's nice having the ...	I purchased these as open box through another site. However, I need to write this review-these headsets are amazing! Bass is incredible and it's nice having the separate dials for sound and game/chat volume balance. Mic is clear as well.<br /><br />I just wanted to say that these can be used on the xbox one, in case you're wondering. All you will need is the microsoft stereo headset adapter. Plug in your controller via the usb cable and keep the headset just plugged into the 3.5 jack on the adapter. They work on pc flawlessly.<br /><br />As for the sound, I prefer them over the px21 earforces that broke on me, as well as the x11's that broke. These are much sturdier, physically, and you can't beat that they're wireless. If they do for some reason have some internal wiring probs, pdp makes it easy on you by enabling easy disassembling. There are 3 screws beneath the foam earcups that lead to the wiring, which can be easily soldered yourself if need be. With that in mind, both pairs have held up nicely with daily usage for over a year.	2015-08-30

Graphics are great, Game play is spot on.This COULD have been another Halo type of game (albeit with RPG and MMO elements). I took 3 stars away because of the sh*tty servers at Bungie and getting kicked off Xbox Live all the time. Bungie is SUPPOSEDLY 'working VERY hard' (as per Bungie.net), but this game has been out for literally MONTHS now (new DLC has even come out), and not a thing has been fixed. I keep getting close to completing a mission and BANG! I get black screened or kicked off Live, or else it's a 'caterpiller' error. And does it save your checkpoint? HELL NO. Gotta start the level all over again. SO FRUSTRATING!!! Is this Bungie's idea of a joke? This game was RUSHED onto the market. Bugs galore. Thank GOD I waited and bought it used for $20.

As a result, my review is coming from a somewhat biased place, since any case was going to have to work really hard to do its job.<br /><br />The case itself fits nicely, though I had to take a few minutes to figure out how to snap it on. If you have your DS open too much or too little, you can't get this on or off. It's a decent clear, so the colour isn't overly compromised, which I do like. It's sturdy enough that I don't feel like it'll have a problem protecting my system, although it's not padded so a decent impact would still break the machine.<br /><br />However, I find it doesn't do a fantastic job of keeping the dust and grime out, by any means. Scratches, yes. Spills, yes. I still find myself having to take off the case to clean it once in a while because my DS starts to get a lot of little particles hanging out under the plastic protector. It's also much more difficult to get the case *off* than it was to get it on.	2015-08-30

Not exactly. As the game begins the tension builds. 8 characters in a more like mansion then cabin but it's really cool and isolated. Yo u have the characters you can't stand with their cocky attitudes then the ones you really like. Sweet and pleasant. Once you are finally introduced to the next year's characters going to the cabin after the tragic accident the year before, in honor of them they return. The character are all introduced as who they really are, compassionate, smart or egotistical and cocky. Not it the males but females as well. Then you get on with the game and your in this freaky office that's with a psychiatrist , I think, that's if he's real. But he sort of guides you thru each chapter telling you what a shifty  job you've  done to date or good job. Then you get a recap before you move on. As you decide die the fate of each character , thinking your really are controlling it which is really not the case cause it's very unpredictable. It reminds me of the freaky dude from the SAW movie talking and giving you a choice, the psychiatrist is a actor I can't quite remember his mane but you'll no. So between. The saw movie and this guy it's kind cool. Your playing threw a movie that's all.not much action game play but very interesting. If I scared easily I'd have been honestly s a red but I don't so I wasn't. It is freaky and bloody. It's a cool game and I'm glad I preordered. I.played it almost from the middle Ute I put it in about 8 pm til 2 am then find pushed up in the am after about 2  more hrs. So you get about 8 to 9 hrs depending on you . The decisions aren't always easy and like I said not what they seem. The storyline is freaky and scary but good it's like playing threw a movie that you semi control.<br />I see me playing this game multiple times trying to see what different outcomes I get.<br />Yes it like watching a killer movie like Halloween and saying to the character 'hoe dumb are you ,he's going to find you' this time your making the the decisions and kicking yourself for making the wrong move.<br />Basically the totems and the butterfly effect and you  are what controls the fate of all of them. So yes ill be 're listing this again and playing I t all in one sitting on those cold winter days when you don't wAnt to go outside.<br />I'm one of those ppl who love action games so for me to like this is a biggie. I actually hated the walking dead games and this is sort of like knob e them control wise but way way better. So I think you'd love this game even if your like me and into the more action games.<br />I'd wait for the price to lower cause I real k y don't think it's worth the cost right now but I don't regret buying it and . I also think. That depends on what kind of gamer you are.<br />I was updating my system when this came and having upgrade problems so it sat there just n my face for 3 days while I finally got my system up and running again. I was in agony. So yeah it was a thrill to play this.<br />As for upgrading your system. I changed mine from the normal 500 gb to a 2 th.it's running I ng awesome and downloads in minutes not hrs with the big games.I've it. I also  'recommend that. I bought the drive on Amazon.

When I open a product, I expect it to start working in 60 seconds. Just like my iPad.<br /><br />It has been over 24 hours. We have been unable to play the game that came with the console. Why? Because we are still downloading the game! It is 20% done after a full day of download. What an awful experience on my birthday! See attached picture.<br /><br />First it took 3 hours just to start the Xbox One. Very unhappy that it took 3 painful hours to get to the welcome screen. Microsoft, is this cool? (Starting the console required a mandatory ~300 MB system update. I have a ~105 Mbps high-speed cable internet line from Comcast. Xbox one has a wired connection. Xbox is receiving internet speed between of 80 - 90 Mbps. Although the game file is downloading at about ~1 Mbps)<br /><br />Dear Microsoft Product Managers, here is a challenge for you. When a customer starts their Xbox One they should be able to begin using it in 60 seconds or less. If it takes several days to start using their game console then Steve Jobs is right about your sense of taste. And from my experience over the last 24 hours - a lack of respect for your customer's emotions.<br /><br />Folks, wish me happy birthday!	2015-08-30

It's far better than most. The six button layout is excellent for Street Fighters V. The button size and placement are nice and feels better than the Dualshock 4. There're really only two things I can complain about this pad. 1. No audio port for headphone/mic. Sure you can use one of those Sony's wireless headphone for the PS4. But it would be nice to have an audio/headphone port for some mic options. 2. The D-Pad, the D-Pad is fine and works as well as the DualShock 4 but the fact that it can rotate lead me to believe that it will be a problem later on. And it feels a little flimsy and cheap like it's about to fall off.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a fight pad or just doesn't have the money for a fight stick. This is clearly the best fight pad for PS4 and PC currently.	2015-08-30

That alone was a big bonus this year for me.  Other than that, some of the catching features make it easier to catch the ball...almost too easy.  Seems like the MUT packs are better than last year right from launch...you should be able to build a decent team just through initial loyalty packs and pre-orders.  Overall, I'm not disappointed...haven't tried the draft game yet, that seems like it might be fun.	2015-08-30

Arrived on time and is made of a very durable plastic. My only problem though is that it does not fit quite the way I want it. The depth and length of the case is a little loose which means it wiggles around. Also, from top to bottom the case almost seems to crush the vita. When putting the case in &#34;locked&#34; position I have to physically force the vita in (with far more force than should be necessary). I used it for a while since it definitely is easier on my hands and wrists when playing for more than 30 minutes, but the design of the case just makes it feel like its damaging my vita so I just don't use it anymore. Great concept and is effective, personally I would not recommend this particular one due to what I see as a fundamental design flaw.	2015-08-30

If you are an avid fan of the TV series, or just a casual gamer looking for a JRPG, I would not recommend this game. Before all the fanboys go insane here is a simple list of both Pros AND Cons of Lost Song.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Amazing graphics that utilizes the Vita's systems perfectly<br />Flight! The flight ability in this game is unparalleled in any other game I have ever played.<br />Co-op. Going online and questing with friends or strangers is a few buttons away and hours of fun.<br />Tons of characters to choose from to play as with a customizable party.<br />A personal pro of mine is that the game is somewhat long, more than just a 4 hour campaign then multiplayer grinding. This game can take a serious chunk of your time to complete and get all the trophies for which in my opinion makes a game worth it.<br />Overall an exciting adventure into one of the worlds that I had watched some of my favorite characters diving into (no pun intended).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Broken aggro<br />No sense of accomplishment from beating powerful bosses<br />0 companion commands/orders<br />Pathetic number of skills<br />Bosses are almost unblock-able, spam the same attacks (dragons should not jump on me every 3 seconds stun locking my whole party), and have an overkill amount of hp/def that needlessly prolongs the battle<br />Awkward and unhelpful map/minimap<br />No sense of deepening character relationships<br />Clumsy item inventory/equip screens<br />Terrible camera angles<br />Repetitive dungeons. There is a point where re-using the EXACT COPY of a tile-set should be illegal<br />The overall plot is not clear because the subplots are given too much importance, weakening the overall storytelling ability of the game.<br />ENEMY RESPAWN RATE. I cannot tell you how many times I left a room, re-entered it with no loading screens in between and end up fighting the same mobs. The RR makes this game an eternal grind fest.<br />The leveling system feels so unrewarding and is broken when compared to the damage/level increases of enemy mobs.<br />Magic targeting needs vast amounts of improvement.<br />Silica is in this game.<br />Restricting classes to only a partial number of an already limited number of weapons is frankly annoying.<br />Enemy aggro is one of the worst parts of this game that take all modern conventions of how aggro works and ignores them, leaving players baffled as to why their healer 3 rooms away is being targeted by the mini-boss instead of your two tanks who are sitting in front of it whacking away at its face.<br />Enemies can dodge repeatedly out of the way of sword skills, whose range is pathetically small and is a locked animation.<br />Indoor enemies can fly, indoor players can't. Indoor enemies can fly over the players attacks. Basically, indoor battles are a bunch of jumping around using the stupid jump attack.<br />Rain is in this game.<br />The block cool down is far to long to be of any use other than protecting your character from a deadly blow once or twice a battle. This feature is completely useless for sustained blocks/counters.<br />Seven is in this game.<br />Stop with the lolis already, we get it japan, you like your lolis, please stop tormenting the rest of the world with your weird fetish. This may just be an opinion that I and I alone hold, but when i'm trying to play an RPG and slay some dragons and rock demons, i'd prefer if a 12 year old did not keep trying to get in to my main character's already questionably large harem.<br />Create your own character! Awesome! Except..its a generic bland character with a total of about 15 options that range from mildly racist to probably racist.<br />Getting struck while in the air means you fall to the ground, no matter the height, no matter the damage that was dealt. This just prolongs battles and makes an awkward lull in combat.<br /><br />Well, that was a fun little list wasn't it? Overall, take this game as it is, a byproduct of the massive amount of attention and adoration gained from SAO the series. If you seriously want a good JRPG that is not only a product of your favorite fantasy world but is also a GOOD GAME, check out SAO: Hollow Fragment for the PS Vita or I think it is SAO: Re: Hollow Fragment for the PS4. Basically, everything Lost Song should have been but without the graphics quality or clear English translations. If you enjoyed my commentary please leave a thumbs up, if I missed anything or if you think there was something that does not match with the reality of the game, feel free to leave a comment.	2015-08-30

This is my favorite fighting game on the PS4. The sexiness is a major major plus. But I think it does try to be semi tasteful. The core gameplay is fantastic, as you would expect from a DOA game. You have lots of stuff to unlock, lots of modes to play, lots of characters.<br /><br />Here is one gripe. How many iterations of DOA5 has there been? Plus, Ultimate, then Last Round. Same kinda applies with Street Fighter IV. Lots of versions that add on to the other. But on Last Round, I made the mistake in assuming that all dlc would be included, which it should have been, if it's the final version. And it's painful to scroll through the costumes, and see that there are tons of costumes that are locked because of dlc. It's a horrible teaser. Everytime you play the game, it shoves the costumes in your face and says 'nah nah you don't have this, neaner neaner'. I would have rather it shown me just what I have, and if I wish to purchase more, I would just go on my PSN store.<br /><br />The graphics are superb. Still has last gen roots, but its shiny and looks great. I love the rock paper scissors fighting dynamic. It's the first fighting game I played where I feel like I'm not just button mashing. I love the game, I wish I could give it a 5 star. From a gameplay point of view, it's definitely a 5 star. But that dlc thing really bothers me. Again, I'm fine with dlc, that's just how games are nowadays, but to scroll through the costume options and always be reminded that you don't have these costumes is really cruel. Especially when I paid top dollar for supposed the ultimate version of the game.	2015-08-30

I purchased the &#34;old&#34; Wii Fit in 2009 and upgraded (happily) to the Wii Fit Plus in 2010.  I was able to really build strength, etc., etc., along with having fun, especially with the Balance Games and Activities, which I used to reward myself.  Because of room restrictions in my home, I found myself not using the program after about a year.  I recently began using it again (now have room availability) and have to say that I'd forgotten how much FUN this program is, especially used in conjunction with other types of exercise.  I found adding in a half hour to hour workout 2 to 3 times a week really helped me to drop some pounds and firm up considerably. The reason I returned to Wii Fit Plus was for the Yoga poses in particular, which I wanted to help strengthen my hip in order to avoid need for hip replacement.  In 6 weeks, I found I had significantly expanded range of motion, less pain (I also walk 5 miles a day), and much greater flexibility, strengh, balance in my lower body.  So I feel my re-adding it into my routines has made a great difference!  I love the fact I can select my own exercises and set them up in order as desired.	2015-08-30

It took me a while to get this game because nobody is talking about it.  But I was really impressed with it the moment I started playing!  The campaign is long in a good way. Each level is around 45 minutes.  This game is really great at variety.  Their are a lot of guns to choose from at the start and wen more in the campaign!  The animations are great!  You get slo mo camera when you get a great shot with the sniper gun!  The graphics are Xbox one graphics!  Horse mode is really intense!  You won't be getting to level 30 easily like cod zombies.

In reality, they hold 22 DS/3DS cartridges, with one of the cartridge sections reserved - on both sides - for SD or Micro SD cards. The way it stands, I'm surprised they didn't call it 26-in-1 since you can technically pack two micro SDs, two SDs, and 22 game cartridges in there... since they already confused you anyway.<br /><br />I bought these expecting 24 cartridge slots, so I was already a little disappointed when I realised I couldn't put them all in that way. HOWEVER, they do work... decently for what they're intended to do.<br /><br />The plastic is decently thick and durable, which in this case is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you don't feel like you'll break anything just by dropping the case. On the other hand... the plastic tabs that hold the games in place are also fairly thick, so sometimes I feel like I'm going to break my *cartridge* trying to wrest it from the case's fiendish grip. Other times, the games just fall out almost on their own...<br /><br />I believe it was said in another review, as well: these cases have tab slots for you to put in 3DS games, but the tabs are flipped from one side to the other. So if you have a game on the top side of the case with its label facing up, and a game on the opposite side, that label will be upside down. There's literally no other way to put it in the case. It doesn't affect DS games since they don't need that extra little slot.<br /><br />The games themselves sit in a little case that, like the hollow of a traditional game case, is just a tiny bit taller than the game. HOWEVER, since there are no moving parts (like in DS cases where you can push your cartridge gently against the tabs to compress them and pull it out), you're basically stuck trying to slide your fingernail under the cartridge and yank it out of the tabs... which, as I said, are pretty thick and sturdy. Your game cartridge will NOT feel nearly so sturdy doing this, sometimes.<br /><br />The slots to hold styluses are just that - little slots between the two sections to hold the stylus. They work fine, but you won't be able to fit anything larger than a traditional stylus (one that you could house in your DS itself) into it. There's nothing else to really say about that.s, sometimes.<br /><br />The slots to hold styluses are just that - little slots between the two sections to hold the stylus.

I know how he is all into Batman, Robin, and the Joker, so while he was at daycare, I upgraded the appearance of his device and set it on his bed as a surprise.<br /><br />This was important for me to do because I had put another decal on his device to decorate it before first giving it to him, but it began to bubble on the first day from the normal heating while being played. We peeled that one off to find that it left a nasty residue that we had to scrub off with alcohol.<br /><br />This one went a lot smoother. It went on seemlessly and the fit was perfect. There were no air bubbles, and it looks GREAT. Plus it seems to be made from superior quality, and not as thin as the last one.<br /><br />It's been a few days, and he's been playing it a lot. So far there are no bubble pockets forming from the heating, and it still looks as cool as it did on the first day. No edges have come up and it really adds character to what comes as a plain old gaming console. The controller decals went on just as well. Needless to say, he adores the graphics. He was so happy to see it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend.<br /><br />I received this product at a DISCOUNT in exchange for my honest review. This is my personal experience with this product, and reflects my own opinion as it would be if I had paid full price for it.	2015-08-30

(Update)	Very weak fan. System feels hotter than before just running netflix. Only use aside from a stand is to charge two controllers and the extra hubs. If you want that I recommend one that isn't a vertical stand and doesn't restrict airflow in to the system.<br /><br />*UPDATE<br />Ok, so I decided to use it for about 3 months...<br /><br />It was fine, a little noisy at first but tolerable. I would say after a month and 3/4 in the noise got louder, which scared me because I thought it was the system. The sound when I disconnected it was golden silence, that's how annoying it was. I use Netflix a lot and believe me when I say it was annoying hearing a mini vacuum while watching Netflix or just on standby/rest mode. After that I only used it while gaming, hoping it would go back to the way it used to sound when I first got it. It didn't workout as planned.<br /><br />So now its laying on top of my flat system being used as a charging/hub station. I recommend that.....yeah just that....unless you like the sound of hand held vaccuums and restricting outwards airflow while keeping the fan off. -gasp for air-	2015-08-30

I love my collector's edition Batman PS4. The matte silver finish on the console and controller is what drew me in. Do not get me wrong, I loved the original black console, but the fact of the matter is that the gloss black HDD cover is prone to scratching. Big time. Even the slightest wipe from a microfiber cloth causes scratches. I do not understand why Sony chose to implement this type of material when they removed it completely from the PS3 slim. It is like taking a step backwards in innovation. Why Sony, why??? So in a couple of years down the road I would have to purchase a PS4 slim? Most likely.<br /><br />The Batman PS4 eliminates this problem and is also part of the reason why I decided to purchase this console even though I had the original black PS4. Like the consoled itself, the controller does not have any gloss. It is quite similar to the likes of the urban camo controller in terms of finish.<br /><br />For the fans who love Batman this is a must. For those who cannot stand the gloss on the original black PS4 the collector edition PS4 seems to be one alternative.<br /><br />Aside from the color the Batman PS4 is exactly the same as the original with updated internals that functions more or less as the original. Even though I paid a premium of approximately $50 for the color I am content with my purchase. It is a very stylish and classy PS4 befitting any household.	2015-08-30

It looks great and works pretty well, too. My biggest complaint is that I am unable to control my TV's volume with the remote. I own a Vizio M-Series TV and all other CEC functions work fine. I can turn on my TV by powering on the Shield, it automatically selects the correct input, and I can even control the Shield with my TV remote. But for whatever reason, it will not control my TV's volume via CEC. This is a pretty big deal for me and it's why I am rating it at 2 stars. This means I need to use another remote to control my audio system. I've been communicating with Nvidia support this past week, but there hasn't been a resolution yet (and I can't say their support is all that great either). This may just be a compatibiltly issue with the TV that I own, but either way, it's a big disappointment for me.  Some other minor issues I have: - Fairly big response delay at certain times. I think the remote must go to sleep or something because if you haven't used the remote for a while and then press a button, sometimes the response can take up to a full second. After that first response, all further actions are pretty much instant. - I wish I could turn my TV off with the remote. There doesn't seem to be support for this. - Too expensive. I got mine on sale for half off. I don't think I'd ever recommend it at $50 especially since it can't replace all other remotes.  EDIT: They finally came out with an update recently that addressed the CEC issues. It is now working as expected for my setup. It only took them about 7 months from the time I originally opened up a ticket with their support staff (and many more before me had as well).	2015-08-30

I was skeptical that this would work, but so far, it's great. The battery packs installed easily and charged pretty quickly. As previous reviews have stated, it's a bit finicky as far as the placement of the remotes in the dock. But that's a small price to pay for a good product at such a low price. As long as you get it situated and leave it alone, it's not a very big issue.<br /><br />The shipment also arrived way ahead of the estimated delivery date, so that was nice as well. Packaging was also of great quality.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.	2015-08-30

I purchased this headset back in December 2013 (it'll almost be two years) and I have to say, it is absolutely fantastic! Aside from being able to immerse myself into my gaming experience, I can also keep all the loud noises from the game to myself so I don't bother my family.<br />Alright, so here's a couple of things:<br />-There are 3 controls on the headset: Game Volume, Chat Volume, Mic (MUTE/ON). To use the chat volume and the Mic, you have to plug in the cord (that's part of the headset) into your controller jack. This is obvious but I thought I'd list it anyways.<br />-The noise amplification works great! 'Great' is an understatement. Anyways, you seriously feel like you're in the game! You just become so immersed in the atmosphere of your game and forget that you're just some dude or dudette sitting in front of a TV with a gaming headset on. NOTE: This headset is capable of bursting your eardrums if you decide to play with MAX volume on the headset, plus the volume control settings of whatever game you're playing. So do be careful with how you select the volume levels.<br />-The cord is really long, which is convenient so you don't have to play right IN FRONT of your TV.<br />-The microphone works fine. The cool thing is that you can slightly hear yourself talking in the headset, so you know you're not being unnecessarily loud.<br />I would say my only complaint is the styrofoam piece where the headset rests on your head. After a while, it does become a little irritating. And for that, I would actually rate this 4.5/5 stars.<br />Other than that, this headset was a satisfactory deal!	2015-08-30

This game is still great and I still recommend it especially if you have never played it before. I don't know if I am just nostalgic, but holy crap is the original soundtrack better!

So basically what my conclusion is is that this is still a good version, but the ps4 version is where it's at. With better graphics and the ability to switch between the original and the remastered soundtrack.	2015-08-30

For many years, I was a 2K guy.  Unfortunately, we all know what happened there.  So, when I decided to get a baseball game I turned to The Show. The graphics deserve an &#34;A&#34;. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall graphics. The players, even the managers actually look like the real deal.  The stadiums look legit.  What really sells it for me is the detail.  Every player has their unique stance or wind up.  Even down to their follow thru on their swing is spot on.  The players movement is extremely fluid, and it doesn't feel fake. Overall, the graphics are first rate.  As far as the gameplay, it feels good. It's smooth, and doesn't feel jerky.  The difficulty is just right.  The batting can be challenging, but not difficult.  The pitching is easy to figure out, and makes you really earn your outs.  I haven't played online yet so I can't comment there.  As far as franchise goes its good stuff.  Still has create a player which is cool, but my only gripe about the game is in the difficulty trying to find the player once you create him.  Still, its a very minor inconvenience and the player can be found. All in all, if you're  looking for a good baseball game, don't hesitate to turn to The Show.	2015-08-30

I have a harder time playing on my plasma than i do on this monitor with sun glare.<br />The monitor comes with a usb brick as well which is handy, but the monitor seems to work just as well plugged directly into the system.<br /><br />The only gripe i could really find is the monitor cover. The holes on the cover didn't perfectly lline up with the brackets on the monitor so i had to really pay attention and use some force to keep the screws from crossthreading, or breaking something.	2015-08-30

I bought this for my PSP 1000 because of my hands cramping. I have grips on my PSP and Vita now.

The wait time for loading is constant, from anything as pausing the game to check the map to gaining new intel on enemy captains. And the wait time itself is atrocious. It takes forever for anything to load. As well, the game has a lot of difficulty rendering its own pieces and environments. When you pause, for example, and it shows an enemy captain, it takes the game a few moments as it loads the character layer by layer (so first you have the basic outline, then some armor, then some more armor, then some new color shades, etc). It does this with the  overworld map, too, especially at night. You take a step one direction and the ground appears very bright in color (as far as the camera can see). Take a step in another direction and suddenly everything is dark again. There are lots and lots of little bugs like this that really should have been worked out before release. It makes for a very poor gaming experience (especially the never-ending load time).<br />It is a fun game and all, but it could be so much better just with basic fixes.	2015-08-30

So far, so good. As in any game, it takes a couple of playing hours to get accustomed to the various ways of playing, but that isn't a big deal. Simulations seems realistic enough, some penalties are frustrating but -I guess- it's my fault as I am still mastering how to play. I changed the setting from &#34;rookie&#34; to the level higher (&#34;pro&#34;, maybe?) and I see a huge difference in the players' behavior. Anyway, great game to spare some time when outside is too cold, raining or snowing.	2015-08-30

Not only is the reaction time on it extremely responsive, but it looks cool while you're playing as well! The picture I took doesn't do it justice, especially when you're playing in a pitch black room. I tried to take pictures with and without flash, but neither was able to capture the true glowing of the blue lights!<br />This is a right-handed mouse so you will need to pay attention to that when ordering, but I am right-handed and it's extremely comfortable to use. This is key for those who game for extremely long periods of time. It definitely helps prevent hand fatigue.<br />It's really easy to use as you simply plug it into your devices USB port and you don't have to worry about battery life or running out during a game. I know this kind of seems like backwards technology, but for gaming it's pretty important. The last thing you want is to run out of battery life in the middle of an epic battle.<br />Overall, this mouse is awesome for gaming, but can also be used as a regular mouse if you so choose. If not, it's easy to unplug and plug in your regular mouse as it's simply connected via USB cord into the device.<br />Disclosure: I purchased this product at a discounted rate and wrote the review on my own.	2015-08-30

I purchased this for my New 3DS XL. Inside the case came a usb charger cable, a car charger, three plastic game cases, two styluses, headphones, and a screen protector for the touch screen. I did not receive a screen protector for the top screen as pictured. The bottom screen protector is fine. The headphones are dollar store quality and I will give them to my niece because they will match her pink DS lite. The cases for games are fine. I haven't used the piece that goes into the car because I have one that I love already. The usb cable works well. I received a pen - like stylus  and another small stylus that appears as though it will fit into my niece's ds lite. It didn't fit into my 3ds. The case itself is not overly bulky but does the job to protect my 3ds. I have dropped it onto my kitchen floor and my ds is fine. It also fits my 3ds even though I have a protective case on it as well. Time will tell how well everything holds up but I am pleased with my purchase. I do wish I did get that top screen protector though!	2015-08-30

I bought this because I played street fighter on the sega genesis as a kid, and after watching some videos of the gameplay and trying the mobile game, I thought I might enjoy the full game.<br />Honestly, I haven't had that much fun playing a brawler in a long time! The music and stages are great, the arcade is challenging yet fun, and the characters are awesome! All of my old favorites like zangief and cammy are there, along with new characters like yun and yang, akuma, even an evil version of ryu! Each character has a unique personality and fighting style, so you'll likely find one that matches yours. They also allow you to do challenges with the characters, typically where you have to do a special move or a combo correctly, along with the classic car bash and barrel smash challenges.<br />To sum it all up, if you're looking for a great brawler or just love street fighter, this is definitely the game you're looking for!	2015-08-30

In fact you really don't even get to do a quick pick of what you would have done in past choices either as the game just randomly rolls a series of choices for you leaving some things awkward for you in the game if that's not the kind of choices you would usually wanna roll with or flat out detrimental to your ability to pick one faction over another and keep them at their highest war assets point, case in point, the game decided for me in the past I'd basically not helped the Krogan one bit what so ever, so by siding with them over the salarians in the game I had just handicapped myself to a small degree in my overall war assets stuff because my krogan faction would never be able to realize its full point amount and would be hampered by negative things.  It was at that point I really just stopped playing this on my Wii U and went back to playing it on my ps3 and 360.  For a game about making your choices matter and count, it really just falls short of that heavily in this version, and with no DLC to speak of available I'd advise playing this on another system if you can unless you just want a good horde/zombie mode game for online play for your Wii U, then by all means give this a go as I love the multiplayer across all three versions.	2015-08-30

To be honest, I'm was never a huge fan of the Alien movies but this game... it's freakin' amazing. I've played other great survival-horror games out there like Amnesia and Outlast and this game takes a place next to them as one of the best survival-horror game. Not going to lie here, you will die a lot in this game if you are not careful. I've already completed the game twice now. My second time on Nightmare mode and boy did it prove to be VERY difficult. This game is very stealth heavy and slow-paced. If you don't have the patience, then you're going to have a rough time playing this game. Now onto the pros and cons I have about this game.<br /><br />Good:<br />+ Alien behavior is completely unpredictable and makes the experience challenging.<br />+ Great atmosphere and level design makes for immersive and tense gameplay.<br />+ Superb soundtrack. The music seems to play at the right moment to make you tense. Play with a good headset for the best experience. Also helps with pinpointing where the Alien is.<br />+ Voice acting is good. A lot of people seem to disagree from the reviews I've read.<br />+ Fun 'hacking' puzzles. All puzzles will be in real-time so watch your back before doing one or else you'll be a sitting duck if the Alien happens to see you.<br />+ A number of useful items to craft and weapons at your disposal. The Flamethrower will be your best friend when you get it.<br />+ Survival Mode adds bit more gameplay after you've completed the main story.<br />+ The Nostromo Edition had The Crew Expendable DLC. It's very short but interesting mission.<br />+ Game is about 15 hours long.<br /><br />Bad<br />- First thing I noticed were choppy scenes and some bad lip and sound sync. There's also bad sound sync throughout the game.<br />- Visuals are... meh. I was able to play the PC version at a friend's house and even on low settings, it looked far better than the PS3 version. The Devs probably had to tweak the settings way down for it to run on the PS3.<br />- I know it's how the devs made it to be but the Alien is ALWAYS in your area and always come searching in a room you are hiding in. Gets annoying when I'm literally hiding in a locker for a good couple of minutes because it keeps coming back.<br />- A few encounters with the Alien and you'll know the sound it makes when it jumps up into or down from a vent but there are times when it'll just magically appear around the corner without making any of those noises and kill you. Kinda BS if you ask me. It did this a couple of time on me.<br />- Sometimes you'll see a random weapon floating around lol<br />- A lot of back tracking during the second-half of the game.<br />- Crouching Simulator. lol I wished the crouching speed was a little bit faster since you'll spend most of the game doing so.<br />- Lack of Auto-save will have you doing an objective over if you keep dying. So save every chance you get. It will auto-save during some moments in the game though.<br />- Crafting UI feels awkward when choosing a component to commit to an item.<br />- Probably the worst thing about this game were the drops in frame rate. It was really headache inducing for me. The game will stutter when you go to a new area or when there's a lot of things happening on the screen.<br /><br />My experience with the PS3 verson was... not so great at times but for the most part it played well.  I still really enjoyed playing it despite the cons I've listed. If you can, I'd say get the PS4 version. If you don't have a PS4 then go ahead and get the PS3 version if you're a person who doesn't care about graphics./>- I know it's how the devs made it to be but the Alien is ALWAYS in your area and always come searching in a room you are hiding in.

It did this a couple of time on me.<br />- Sometimes you'll see a random weapon floating around lol<br />- A lot of back tracking during the second-half of the game.<br />- Crouching Simulator. lol I wished the crouching speed was a little bit faster since you'll spend most of the game doing so.<br />- Lack of Auto-save will have you doing an objective over if you keep dying. So save every chance you get. It will auto-save during some moments in the game though.<br />- Crafting UI feels awkward when choosing a component to commit to an item.<br />- Probably the worst thing about this game were the drops in frame rate. It was really headache inducing for me. The game will stutter when you go to a new area or when there's a lot of things happening on the screen.<br /><br />My experience with the PS3 verson was... not so great at times but for the most part it played well.  I still really enjoyed playing it despite the cons I've listed. If you can, I'd say get the PS4 version. If you don't have a PS4 then go ahead and get the PS3 version if you're a person who doesn't care about graphics.e listed. If you can, I'd say get the PS4 version.

It closes enough to let the DS go to sleep, so I guess it isn't that much of an issue, but I took away a star for that. Other than that, they fit perfectly once on, and I haven't noticed any slipping or sliding underneath my thumb when moving the stick! Recommended.	2015-08-30

I don't like that you can't use them on the first system but my son is happy that they came out with the super hero's on the 2.0 system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.

I wear these glasses for the last hour before I go to bed every night so I can continue taking in information, and I definitely think it's improving my sleep.	2015-08-30

It won't pair up.  See sony forums:<br /> http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-General/Bluetooth-Headset-Support-for-the-PS4/td-p/44751616<br />If you try to pair it it just keeps giving you an error message stating &#34;Cannot find a profile supported by the PS4&#34; (see pic).  Despite it saying it works for PS4 on the box, IT DOESN'T.  I emailed Gioteck support and haven't heard back yet, see link:<br />http://www.gioteck.com/support/contact-support/contact-support-usa/<br />Other than not working on PS4 this item itself seems sturdy enough on its own.  I'm sure it would be nice if you use it on other consoles/laptop/mobile.  I believe this issue is due to Sony trying to only sell their products and limiting consumer choice.  However, Gioteck should not market it as PS4 compatible on the box when it isn't either.  I am returning it to buy a Sony approved headset.  While I hate to say it, save yourself time and frustration and just buy stuff made by Sony for the PS4.<br />Don't but this if intending to use on PS4!!!

US	4236412	R6C4Z5K1BVL27	B00ZMBLKPG	966892383	Gears of War: Ultimate Edition - Xbox One	Video Games	5	2	3	N	Y	Its a remake not a remaster.	This game is a remake, meaning the defining characteristic of Gears of war 1 had to show and stick around; literally Fps , clunky, and simply slow in comparison to Gears 2/3. This was due to time restrain and the port simply not working as well to Xbox one but the way I see it it was not only an opportunity for Black tusk to experiment as well as measure sales but it simply gave them the opportunity to get used to the essence of what makes a Gears game a Gears game; this is where it all started after all.  The graphics and story are revamped give both newcomers a beautiful first time experience and the veterans, like me, the nostalgia we hoped for. The game is absolutely amazing in comparison and for those who don't agree.... They've gotta be blind or relying on memory (try gears 1 for Xbox 360 its like $5) I cant make it past the 1st chapter even if you paid me. I simply don't have enough patience for the outdated mechanics. However I found myself walking though gears UE analyzing the graphics in ever chapter, amazed instead of running through and even attempting to wallbouce since the speed was now fast enough to consider it.  Inn every chapter I noticed the scene was always kept true to gow1 but updated to have more of an effect in rage of emotions due to a now noticeable blood shed, light coming in on a garden, or the characters reacting to someone's death who was before disregarded and unimportant and It hurts ... Haha however the big con I noticed was the AI...they're broken and seem to have been doing drugs since they run into walls, take cover on the wrong walls keeping themselves exposed, and occasionally having a dance off which could cause single players a major issue and I find it unforgivable to have such a massive issue left un-addressed.  Multiplayer wise.... It's a brutal as it's ever been and not for everyone. You won't be able to pick it up as easily as a call out duty game or halo. People playing this game are unforgiving and its best to play alongside someone else or a team if youre new lol.  People will constantly complain about the gnasher accuracy (as always) , speed, and power weapon rages and I doubt this will ever change but I have to say this is an enjoyable multiplayer in comparison to GOWJ and I would regard it almost as highly as GOW3. There are kinks that need to be worked out but nothing I noticed that couldn't be patched in later and it shouldn't take 1000 patched like with destiny or the, still broken halo mcc; this works. Lol my personal issue with the game is not having surround sound but, correct me if I'm wrong, this seems to be a feature mostly unsupported by Xbox one and not just the game in general.   If you buy this and you're new, please, please, please, play the campaign first and get used to the mechanics since multiplayer may turn you off from the game. It's a shark tank but it's the rush you get once you've gotten used to it that will keep some of us up until 7am playing -it may  take some brutal beatings before you begin to enjoy it. XD	2015-08-30

Honestly, I'm not pro gamer, and just wanted something that plays nice with a mix of games (Destiny, Bloodborne, etc). I average maybe 1-2hrs on weekdays, and more on weekends. What I've started to notice is that my thumbstick covers have started to kind of deform around my thumbsticks, changing from their initial orientation and becoming kind of lob-sided in shape. I also can tell I'm slowly starting to wear down the actual gecko shaped texture of the grip making them progressively less grippy. I didn't pay much for them, so I can't say several months of use is a bad deal, but don't buy these if you're expecting them to last you a good long while.	2015-08-30

I have to admit that the LEGO Movie was amusing, and it was fun to see some of the elements and humor brought over to the game.  Thing is, while there is more of an adventure mode to this game, it still seems to be a re-re-re-repeat of every other LEGO game that preceded it.  There are also some gameplay elements that are not quite intuitive.  It's nothing we really go out of the way to play here at Casa Rudy, but it's not a terrible game either.  A good one to get at a discount.	2015-08-30

First off this is a REALLY good game. The first time you play through it everything is very tense and it's a great story based game which it very much worth playing. That being said there isn't as much replayability to the game as I had hoped. I've been through it 3 times just to make different choices and I'm not going to go into spoilers, but trust me, with the exception of a few key choices that you make the outcome of the game as much as everyone thought it would. However this is still a very good game but to go through it once without knowing anything about it will take you about 7 hours. It's a great game to play but I recommend renting instead of paying the full $60.	2015-08-30

At this time it's the only Cave game available for the PS3, everything else is on the Xbox 360. I'd invest in that if I were you. Also, there is a slight delay in movements while playing this game. While it isn't a deal breaker, this game requires memorization and good reaction speeds on the part of the player. Having my ship move slower than I can react is definitely annoying at times. No matter, I only bought this to support Cave. I play a much superior version on MAME. If you are looking for an arcade perfect port, I suggest MAME. If you want to support Cave like me, by this and then play a ROM on MAME.<br />Enjoy~	2015-08-30
